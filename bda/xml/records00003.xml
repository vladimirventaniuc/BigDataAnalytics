      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Cambodia is one of the poorest and least developed countries in Asia. Eighty percent of Cambodians live in rural areas, 45 % are under the age of 20 and approximately 28 % live below the poverty line. Despite recent improvements in health indicators, maternal mortality remains high at 206 deaths/100,000 live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although the total fertility rate declined to 3.0 births per woman in recent years, there remains unmet need for contraception. The 2010 Cambodia Demographic and Health survey (DHS) reported that although 81 % of women of reproductive age wanted to delay their next child or have no more children, only 35 % reported using a modern contraceptive method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
      <p>The abortion rate in Cambodia has been estimated to be 50/1,000 women, compared to the global average of 28/1,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As fertility can return within two weeks it is important to start contraception as soon as possible after abortion if the woman wants to prevent subsequent unintended pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In Cambodia, amongst women who have had an abortion, 26 % have had more than one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This suggests there is a need to improve contraception uptake and continuation post-abortion.</p>
      <p>Mobile phone-based interventions (‘mHealth’) refer to the use of mobile technologies for health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. mHealth interventions can utilise different modes of communication; for example, text-message, voice messages, video and smartphone applications and may involve one-direction or two-way (interactive) communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. mHealth interventions can deliver support inexpensively wherever a person is located, whenever it is needed. In particular, mHealth has the potential to reach youth and rural populations, where geographical distances can restrict access to in-person services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although a number of mHealth contraception initiatives have been launched and scaled up in low-income settings, to date, the effect of mHealth interventions on post-abortion family planning (PAFP) have not been reliably established. There is therefore a need for more evidence on the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for PAFP.</p>
      <p>Formative research is often used to design context-specific interventions. It may involve literature reviews and research with the target population and other key stakeholders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the process is rarely reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This paper outlines the formative research process we used to inform development of the MOTIF intervention to support PAFP in Cambodia.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec2">
      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>The MOTIF study was conducted at four Marie Stopes International Cambodia (MSIC) clinics providing comprehensive sexual and reproductive healthcare services; two serving predominantly urban populations around Phnom Penh City, and two serving predominantly rural populations (Battambang and Siem Reap). Ethical approval was granted by the LSHTM ethics committee, the MSI ethics committee and the Cambodia Human Research.</p>
      <sec id="Sec3">
        <title>Ethics Committee</title>
        <p>Development of the MOTIF intervention was iterative and included processes recommended for the development of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We drew on existing knowledge and reviewed literature (using simple keyword searches) in the following areas with particular reference to Cambodia; determinants of contraceptive use, behaviour change theory, interventions delivered by mobile phone in other areas, interventions for improving contraception use.</p>
        <p>Research conducted in Cambodia included a case note review of clinic data, interviews and focus group discussions (FGD), consultation with clinicians and local organisations implementing mHealth activities, development of a conceptual framework, and testing the intervention with the target group.</p>
        <p>Case note review of 100 MSIC abortion clients was conducted during October and November 2012 using routinely collected data to estimate baseline event rates. We identified the first 25 clients seeking abortion services at each of the four clinics attending sequentially from 1st September 2011 from the clinic register. Repeat attendances over subsequent 12-months were identified. Where available, data was collected on age of client, residence, provision of a mobile phone number, contraceptive history, reason for abortion, subsequent follow-up attendances, contraceptive use and abortions. Data were summarised using simple statistics. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> contains a summary of characteristics of clients from the case note review, interviews and FGDs.</p>
        <p>Following the case note review we conducted interviews and FGDs with clients seeking abortion services. Clients attending for abortion services were recruited sequentially, and asked if they would like to participate at the end of their post-abortion counselling session. Clients were provided with an information sheet to read, or it was read to them, and provided signed or thumb-printed consent. Clients were either interviewed at the time of attending for abortion services or when attending for follow-up appointment, according to their preference.</p>
        <p>Author UV conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with clients during December 2013 and January 2014 across the four study clinics in the Khmer (Cambodian) language. A topic guide was developed containing questions to explore clients’ reasons for seeking abortion services, contraception and mobile phone use and to seek views on the proposed intervention (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Clients were contacted for a follow-up phone interview after one-month. There were three refusals because clients stated that they didn’t have time. Interviews were recorded and transcribed into English and read by author CS to identify key themes.</p>
        <p>Four FGDs were conducted during January and February 2014; two at urban clinics, and two at rural clinics. The aim of the FGDs was to test proposed messages. The FGD topic guide was informed by the interviews. FGDs were conducted by authors CS and UV and a summary of the discussion transcribed to English. Transcripts were read by CS to identify key themes. These findings were used to guide intervention development. We also consulted with other organisations implementing mobile phone-based interventions in Cambodia.</p>
        <p>We developed a preliminary intervention based on these activities. The messages were then tested with eleven interview and FGD participants who agreed to receive messages on their mobile phones. Messages were modified based on feedback received on content, tone, speed of voice, and sound quality.</p>

        <title>Literature on determinants of contraceptive use, with a focus on Cambodia</title>
        <p>We reviewed literature on determinants of contraceptive use in order to identify areas amenable to an intervention. We found Sheeran’s framework to be useful as it combines developmental models (describing contraceptive use resulting from transition through a series of stages) and decision-making models (psychological factors that speed up or delay this transition). Sheeran’s framework considers contraceptive use as a product of <italic>background</italic>, <italic>intrapersonal</italic>, <italic>interpersonal</italic> and <italic>situational</italic> factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The 2010 Cambodia DHS collected data on <italic>background</italic> factors associated with contraceptive use reporting increased contraceptive use with increasing parity, wealth, and levels of educational attainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Westoff conducted additional analysis on <italic>intrapersonal</italic>, <italic>interpersonal</italic> and <italic>situational</italic> reasons for non-use of contraception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Globally, health concerns including side-effects are the commonest reasons for non-use of contraception; this is particularly evident in Cambodia, with health concerns accounting for almost 50 % of non-use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
        <p>We identified qualitative research supporting these findings. Experience of negative side-effects may be related to traditional health beliefs in Cambodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Petitet and Desclaux reported that in Cambodia, abundant menstruation (the expulsion of ‘bad blood’) is viewed as a sign of good health and fertility. Contraceptive methods that cause reduced menstruation can cause women to worry about blood retention leading to discontinuation.</p>
        <p>Dingle identified factors related to knowledge, access, cost and autonomy as important reasons for non-use of contraception in Cambodia. Women often obtain information about contraception from friends and relatives, with myths and rumours commonplace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, not all women have full autonomy over health care decision-making. The Cambodia DHS reported that only 45 % of married women make their own decisions about health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Sex workers in Cambodia have even less autonomy, often reporting coercion by clients into unprotected sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Finally, access and cost can influence choice of contraceptive method, particularly for poor women living in rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec6">
        <title>Behaviour change theory</title>
        <p>Lopez highlighted the need for increased attention to theory of behaviour change in designing and evaluating interventions for contraception use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition to understanding existing contraceptive behaviour, we drew on behaviour <italic>change theory.</italic> Michie defined ‘behaviour change interventions’ as <italic>‘coordinated sets of activities designed to change specified behaviour’</italic> and developed a taxonomy of behaviour change techniques, e.g., provision of information on risks, consequences of actions, or conversely, encouragement and goal setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We applied this framework as its development involved a systematic literature review, evaluation of existing frameworks and reliability testing. At its core a ‘behaviour system’ involves three essential conditions; <italic>capability</italic> [an individual’s psychological and physical capacity to engage in the activity), <italic>motivation</italic> (the brain processes that direct behaviour which include conscious decision-making and emotional responding) and <italic>opportunity</italic> (factors that lie outside the individual that make behaviour possible) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec7">
        <title>Literature on interventions delivered by mobile phone in other areas</title>
        <p>We reviewed evidence from systematic reviews of mHealth interventions. Free, et al.,’s systematic review of mHealth interventions found that there is currently no evidence of benefit for simple text-message medication reminders (RR 1.00, 0.77–1.30) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This is consistent with existing adherence research demonstrating that multifaceted interventions can be effective but uni-faceted interventions have modest benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
        <p>Multi-faceted mHealth interventions have been shown to increase smoking cessation in a high-income setting and adherence to HIV medication in a low-income setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Of particular interest was the WellTel trial in Kenya, evaluating a multi-faceted intervention for HIV medication adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Participants were sent a weekly text-message in the local language asking, <italic>“How are you?”</italic> If the message was seen by a third person it was not obvious that that it was sent from a HIV clinic. Health workers would then phone clients who reported a problem. Medication adherence was higher in the intervention group, demonstrating that an mHealth intervention could be effective when confidentiality and privacy are important.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec8">
        <title>Literature on mHealth in Cambodia</title>
        <p>We found limited published literature on mHealth in Cambodia although Cambodians are enthusiastic mobile phone users, as can be witnessed during daily life in both urban and rural areas. Although mobile phone ownership is estimated to be over 90 %, most Cambodians use simple rather than internet-enabled smartphones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. There is significant interest in mHealth in Cambodia among an increasing number of organisations.</p>
        <p>Bullen identified a number of operational challenges facing mHealth programmes in Cambodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Cambodian mobile phone users often have multiple Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) cards and share phones, which can make it difficult to maintain contact with users. Cambodians often prefer to use their mobile phone for voice calls rather than text-messages as many phones lack Khmer language capability. Furthermore, whilst literacy levels are 90 % in urban areas, this figure is lower (69 %) in rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec9">
        <title>Literature on interventions for contraception including those delivered by mobile phone</title>
        <p>We next reviewed literature on behaviour change interventions to increase contraception use. Systematic reviews have found limited evidence for interventions to improve contraception and PAFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We identified three trials of mHealth interventions aimed at increasing use of contraception, all evaluating text-message interventions. The two trials that did not show an effect both evaluated simple uni-faceted text-message interventions (contraception reminders) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The intervention that was effective comprised a variety of daily educational text-messages and oral contraceptive (OC) reminders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
        <p>Other successful mHealth contraception initiatives in low-income settings include Mobile for Reproductive Health (m4RH) and Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action (MAMA). m4RH used best practices from health communication programs to systemically develop family planning text messages and MAMA developed adaptable messages based on WHO and UNICEF guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec10">
        <title>Findings from the case note review</title>
        <p>The case note review found uptake of effective PAFP either immediately after abortion or at two-week follow-up to be 40 % (<italic>n</italic> = 40) (OC, intra-uterine device, implant, injection). Over 50 % of clients did not return to the MSIC clinic for any reason within 12-months of having an abortion. 4 % of clients returned to the same clinic for repeat abortion within 12-months with 8 % returning with repeat pregnancy. Over 80 % of clients provided a mobile phone number.</p>

        <p>Interview and FDG participants reported seeking abortion services for mainly economic, or less commonly, health reasons. Most women disclosed the abortion to their husband or partner. Many women reported side-effects when using contraception in the past. Clients reported it was difficult to make PAFP choices at the time of abortion. Reasons for this included wanting to wait for their health to improve first, having to wait for their salary or needing to discuss with their husband. Some women reported they were unable to retain sufficient information about contraception. When we contacted clients for the one-month post-interview phone call they often had many questions relating to contraception and side-effects.</p>
        <p>Regarding the proposed mHealth intervention, most clients said they preferred to make phone calls over text-message. Most could not read and many had never used text-messaging. However, most reported listening to voice messages received on their phones. All clients were positive about the proposed new MOTIF intervention. Despite sharing of phones, privacy was not mentioned as a particular concern. Most clients stated that messages sent to their phones should mention the terms ‘Marie Stopes’ and ‘contraception’ so they would know the topic of the message and who it was from. Consultation with clinic staff and organisations implementing mHealth activities in Cambodia also suggested a limited likelihood of success with a text-message intervention.</p>

        <title>Developing a conceptual framework and the final intervention</title>
        <p>We developed a conceptual framework (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) for the intervention that considered determinants of contraceptive use, links between contraceptive use and fertility and theory of behaviour change. There is an emphasis on addressing <italic>intrapersonal</italic> factors, in particular health concerns. The intervention aimed to improve clients <italic>capability</italic> to use contraception by providing information about methods, <italic>opportunity</italic> to use contraception i.e. informing clients where they can access contraception near to where they live, and <italic>motivation</italic> by re-enforcing the benefits of contraception use and providing support relating to side-effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Conceptual Framework for the MOTIF intervention in Cambodia</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12978_2015_112_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
        <p>We tested the messages with clients and made final modifications based on their feedback. See Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> for a description of the final intervention. Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> summarises how formative research findings contributed towards the intervention design.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Final MOTIF intervention</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>The MOTIF final intervention comprised a series of automated voice messages to participants’ mobile phones over the three-month period following their abortion, at the time of day of their preference. Clients received the first message within one-week of receiving abortion services and then every two-weeks, with a total of six messages. The main message, recorded in the Khmer language, was as follows:</td></tr><tr><td> 
<italic>‘Hello, this is a voice message from a Marie Stopes counsellor. I hope you are doing fine. Contraceptive methods are an effective and safe way to prevent unplanned pregnancy. I am waiting to provide free and confidential contraceptive support to you. Press 1 if you would like me to call you back to discuss contraception.

</td></tr><tr><td>Clients who pressed 1, or who did not respond to the message prompts, received a phone call from a counsellor. The phone calls aimed to support contraceptive use by addressing clients’ <italic>capability</italic> to use contraception by providing individualised information on a range of contraceptive methods, <italic>opportunity</italic> to use contraception e.g. informing clients where they could access specific methods near to their residence, and <italic>motivation</italic> by re-enforcing the benefits of contraception use. If the client requested, the counsellor would also discuss contraception with the husband or partner. Follow-up calls to clients were made during preferred times indicated by the client on her registration form. Clients were also able to call the MOTIF service at any time to request to speak with a counsellor. Clients that chose to receive the OC or injectable could opt to receive additional reminder messages appropriate to their method (e.g. to start a new packet of pills or when to receive a new injection). The sixth and final voice message provided similar information to the first five, but also reminded the client that this would be the last message they will receive.<break/>The MOTIF intervention was delivered by trained counsellors at the MSIC head office in Phnom Penh. Voice messages were scheduled and sent using the open-source software programme ‘Verboice’, developed by InSTEDD (instedd.org). MSIC incurred the cost of outgoing communication from the provider to client, and clients incurred any costs calling into the service (the cost of a local call).</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Implications of key formative research findings for intervention design</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Formative research component</th><th>Key findings</th><th>Implication for intervention design</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Insights from contraception literature</td><td>• Health concerns identified as major reason for non-use.

      <title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
      <p>We used a wide range of methods to inform the development of the MOTIF intervention. Our literature review indicated that our intervention should address intrapersonal factors, in particular health concerns. We found limited evidence on behaviour change interventions to increase the use of specific contraceptives. Whilst this may be partly due to a limited number of high quality, adequately powered trials, the focus of the interventions needs to be examined. Interventions often focus on adherence to a specific method, which may be less effective than an intervention that anticipates method-specific discontinuation and facilitates safe method switching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We designed an intervention to offer to all women seeking abortion services, regardless of the immediate plans for PAFP.</p>
      <p>A key finding from the case note review was high unmet need for PAFP. It was not known if clients used other providers to obtain contraception as most women did not return to MSIC clinics. Most clients provided a mobile phone number, which led us to believe that a mHealth intervention could be an opportunity to maintain contact with clients. Interviews and FGDs supported these findings. Health concerns related to contraception were widely reported. Clients also stated a clear preference for a voice-based intervention. In developing the conceptual framework and intervention we hypothesised that a multi-faceted mHealth intervention would remind clients about contraceptive methods, identify problems with side-effects early, provide support, and boost motivation to use PAFP, while reducing discontinuation and method switching.</p>
      <p>The strength of this paper is that we have clearly described how each component of the formative research contributed to the final intervention design. Interventions are often developed without evidence of having gone through a formative research process or without clearly describing that process. Furthermore, existing behaviour or theoretically predicted mechanisms of action are not fully described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Our research allowed us to gain an understanding of successful interventions, and to avoid repeating mistakes of unsuccessful projects. Our limitations were mainly due to time and resource constraints. A limitation of our formative research is that analysis of the interviews and FGDs was not undertaken by a second coder. Furthermore, the literature searches were not systematic. However, it is important to consider when to stop the development process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>Using a similar approach to Lester, et al., we developed a semi-automated intervention, which sought to identify clients most in-need of counsellor delivered support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Where the MOTIF intervention differs from Lester and other mHealth contraception interventions is that it is voice-based. The main reasons for this were rural literacy levels, lack of functionality of Khmer script on phones, and client preference. This study provides some insights into mobile phone-based interventions intervention development in low-literacy settings.</p>
      <p>The MOTIF intervention was associated with an increase in self-reported contraception use four months post-abortion but not at 12 months. The intervention was associated with increased long-acting contraception use at four and 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A process evaluation will explore participants’ experience and cost comparison of MOTIF with other interventions.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Integration of first- and second-generation ethanol production can facilitate the introduction of second-generation lignocellulosic ethanol production. Consolidation of the second-generation with the first-generation process can potentially reduce the downstream processing cost for the second-generation process as well as providing the first-generation process with energy. This study presents novel experimental results from integrated first- and second-generation ethanol production from grain and wheat straw in a process development unit. The results were used in techno-economic evaluations to investigate the feasibility of the plant, in which the main co-products were distiller’s dried grains with solubles and biogas.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>An overall glucose to ethanol yield, of 81 % of the theoretical, based on glucose available in the raw material, was achieved in the experiments. A positive net present value was found for all the base case scenarios and the minimal ethanol selling price varied between 0.45 and 0.53 EUR/L ethanol. The revenue increased with combined xylose and glucose fermentation and biogas upgrading to vehicle fuel quality. A decrease in the biogas yield from 80 to 60 % also largely affects the net present value. The energy efficiency for the energy content in products available for sale compared with the incoming energy content varied from 74 to 80 %.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>One of the two main configurations can be chosen when designing an integrated first- and second-generation ethanol production plant from grain and straw: that producing biogas or that producing distiller’s dried grains with solubles from the xylose sugars. The choice depends mainly on the local market and prices for distiller’s dried grains with solubles and biogas, since the prices for both co-products have fluctuated a great deal in recent years. In the current study, however, distiller’s dried grains with solubles were found to be a more promising co-product than biogas, if the biogas was not upgraded to vehicle fuel quality. It was also concluded that additional experimental data from biogas production using first- and second-generation substrates are required to obtain improved economic evaluations.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Most bioethanol is currently produced from sugar- and starch-containing materials, such as sugar cane, corn, and wheat grain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Ethanol production from these easily accessible sugars is usually referred to as first-generation (1G) production. However, the use of these crops has become the subject of debate as they are food crops, and it has been argued that they can be put to better use as food. The use of lignocellulosic materials, such as agricultural residues, forest materials, and dedicated crops, referred to as second-generation (2G) production, is therefore being promoted. However, lignocellulosic materials have a more recalcitrant structure and a different carbohydrate composition than the materials used in 1G ethanol production; in addition the residual material generated in the 2G process differs from the 1G process. The more complex 2G process affects the overall design and usually increases the cost for 2G ethanol production, e.g., the requirement for pretreatment and handling of various solid materials.</p>
      <p>Integration of 1G and 2G ethanol production can offer a means of reducing the cost of producing 2G bioethanol while the technology matures, and helping to establish also 2G ethanol production. Furthermore, integration of the sugar-rich material to 2G fermentation results in a higher ethanol concentration in the broth without the need to increase the solid content, which would also increase inhibition. A higher ethanol concentration can decrease the cost of downstream processing, such as distillation, in the 2G plant, while at the same time supplying the 1G plant with heat and electricity produced from the residual solid material from the 2G plant. Integration can be achieved either by designing a completely new combined plant, or by installing a 2G unit at an existing 1G plant.</p>
      <p>The production of wheat, one of the largest starch-grain products in Europe, with a production of 230 million tons in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], also results in large amounts of residual straw. Some of this straw should be left on the field as soil conditioner; however, the rest could be used for ethanol production. The integration of a 1G and a 2G plant-producing ethanol from grain and straw is thus of considerable interest. Integration is possible at several stages in the process, from directly after pretreatment, to the downstream processes, for example, in the distillation or evaporation steps. Thus, several different process configurations are possible. In the present study, integration in the fermentation step is considered. This will increase the ethanol concentration in the broth, thus reducing the energy demand in distillation compared to a 2G stand-alone plant. Moreover, the water consumption in the process can also be decreased by utilizing liquid from the 2G process to dilute the broth in the fermentation step of the 1G process.</p>
      <p>Techno-economic evaluations have recently been performed for integrated 1G and 2G (1G + 2G) ethanol production from sugar cane and lignocellulosic residues, such as bagasse and trash [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Several studies on the simulation of ethanol production have also been reported, for example, from starch (corn with and without corn stover) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], corn stover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and other lignocellulosic agricultural residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no techno-economic evaluations of the integration of 1G + 2G ethanol production from grain and wheat straw have been performed, although evaluations of 1G + 2G ethanol production in various biorefinery systems have been carried out for wheat grain and wheat straw separately. Various alternatives for the production of value-added co-products and the improvement of the process in a 1G wheat-based plant have then been investigated. Arifeen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] studied the extraction of gluten, yeast, and husk for co-product production, as well as yeast cell recycling and on-site enzyme production, in order to improve the process. Sadhukhan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] investigated the potential to extract arabinoxylan from the bran fraction as a co-product. The effect of the conversion of the stillage to biogas instead of distillers dried grain with solubles (DDGS) on the energy consumption of the 1G plant has been described by Pfeffer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and, more recently, by Rajendran et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Studies on the 2G production of ethanol from wheat straw have focused on heat integration and exergy analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], downstream processing of the stillage for anaerobic digestion or evaporation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and techno-economic evaluations of a number of process alternatives for various co-products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the techno-economic evaluations of integrated 1G + 2G ethanol production that have been performed, mainly sugar cane and bagasse were the substrates considered. These processes differ from that with grain and straw in the composition of the raw material and the co-products. One of the main co-products of ethanol production from sugar cane and bagasse is electricity, while in the case of grain and straw, DDGS can be produced as a co-product from the considerable amount of protein in the grain. Thus the co-products are attractive in two completely different markets.</p>
      <p>The present study was performed to evaluate the feasibility of ethanol production in an integrated 1G + 2G plant using grains and wheat straw as the raw materials. Experimental trials were first carried out in a process development unit with 30-L reactors to verify the fermentation results obtained previously on lab scale using a mixture of wheat and barley grain meal (WBG) and wheat straw by Erdei et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The results were then used in computer simulations of different cases to investigate how the production of DDGS and other co-products would affect the economy of the plant. Aspen Plus was used for the simulations since it can handle both material and energy balances, and provides dimensioning data for the equipment, which are needed in the economic evaluations. The economic evaluations were performed with Aspen Process Economic Analyzer (APEA) supplemented with data from vendors’ quotations. In addition, Aspen Plus is useful for performing sensitivity analysis when experimental results are insufficient or unreliable. An example of this is the anaerobic digestion system, which has not been extensively explored concerning the use of substrates from 1G + 2G ethanol production. In this case, by varying the yield of biogas the effect on the NPV can be estimated.</p>

        <title>Experimental results</title>
        <p>The results of enzymatic hydrolysis (EH) of the steam-pretreated wheat straw (SPWS), and the fermentation of the SPWS and the WBG are shown in Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Duplicate experiments, denoted as Exp 1 and Exp 2, were performed in both EH and ftermentation. The liquid fraction of the hydrolyzed SPWS was first added to the fermenter, and after 8 h the feeding of the saccharified WBG started.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Results of enzymatic hydrolysis (EH) of the steam-pretreated wheat straw (SPWS)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13068_2015_423_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Fermentation of the hydrolyzed steam-pretreated wheat straw (SPWS) and the wheat and barley grain (WBG)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13068_2015_423_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
        <p>The final glucose concentration in EH was 62.8 ± 0.2 g/L, and was reached after only 24 h, corresponding to an average glucose yield of 87 ± 0 % of the theoretical (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Therefore, the hydrolysis time was set to 24 h in the Aspen Plus simulations. The final xylose concentration was 10.5 ± 0.1 g/L, corresponding to a xylose yield of 84.8 ± 0 % of the theoretical in both cases (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the ethanol and glucose concentrations during 96 h of fermentation. The ethanol production rate was highest during the first 8 h, 3.7 g/L ethanol per hour, and then decreased significantly to an average of 1.3 g/L ethanol per hour. This was due to the somewhat low feeding rate, (200 ml/h corresponding to 50 g glucose/h) which did not allow faster production as no glucose accumulated in the broth. The ethanol concentration however increased even after the feed was stopped (after 72 h), which is likely due to the presence of intracellular metabolites. Glucose is often taken up faster than ethanol is produced, which will result in intracellular glucose and ethanol accumulation that cannot be detected, when the broth is analyzed. The final ethanol concentration was 84.0 ± 1.1 g/L after 96 h. The overall process ethanol yield based on the amount of glucose available in the raw material was calculated to be 81.3 %. In the simulations, the overall ethanol yield was 79.7 % since it was assumed that some glucose was utilized for yeast cultivation.</p>

        <title>Simulations</title>
        <p>Seven cases were simulated in the present study. The cases consisted of a 1G stand-alone plant (1G) followed by six integrated 1G + 2G plants. In the three first cases (1G, E1, and B1) only glucose fermentation was considered. In E1, concentration by evaporation of the thin stillage, generated in the solid–liquid separation step after distillation, was modeled. The concentrated solution was then re-mixed with the solids generated in the solid–liquid separation step after the distillation. This mixture was subsequently transferred to the dryer. In B1, the thin stillage was transferred to anaerobic digestion instead of being concentrated. In case C5E1 and C5B1, glucose and xylose fermentation was modeled for the E1 and B1 configurations. The last two cases UB1 and UC5B1 were based on B1 and C5B1, respectively; however, the biogas was in these cases upgraded to vehicle fuel quality. A more detailed description of the cases is presented in the section “<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” under “<xref rid="Sec29" ref-type="sec">Case description</xref>”.</p>

        <p>Only the excess electricity that can be sold was regarded as a product when calculating the energy efficiency. However, the total amount of electricity produced was considered in the economic assessment, since the income from green electricity certificates can be included in the profit. The energy efficiency and the net heat and electricity required to produce 1 kg of ethanol are presented in Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Energy efficiency for products/incoming energy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13068_2015_423_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig><fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Heat and electricity required per kg ethanol produced</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13068_2015_423_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p>
        <p>Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the energy efficiency for each product. The total energy efficiency for the products in the integrated cases was in the range of 74–76 %. The 1G case had a somewhat higher total energy efficiency of 80 %. The variation between the integrated cases is mainly due to the energy efficiency of the co-products. The higher energy efficiency for ethanol in the C5B1 case than in the C5E1 case, in spite of the fact that equal amounts of ethanol were produced, is due to the fact that natural gas had to be added in the latter case.</p>
        <p>The total heat and electricity demand for the process per kg ethanol produced is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The cases including evaporation (1G, E1, and C5E1) had a higher energy demand per kg ethanol produced than the cases without evaporation (B1, C5B1, UB1, and UC5B1). This was mainly due to the higher energy input in the evaporator trains and in the dryer. In all the cases including evaporation, extra energy in the form of natural gas had to be supplied to the process.</p>

        <p>It can be seen from Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> that all the cases studied exhibited positive NPVs (light blue bars), and that the NPV increased considerably with C5 fermentation and biogas upgrading to vehicle fuel quality (C5E1, C5B1, UB1, and UC5B1) compared to the corresponding C6 fermenting case. However, the E1 case resulted in a much higher NPV than the B1 case, due to the larger amount of DDGS produced. The difference in NPV between cases C5E1 and C5B1 decreased, compared with cases E1 and B1, due to the fact that natural gas had to be utilized in the C5E1 case, as less residual sugars were available for anaerobic digestion. The 1G plant showed a lower NPV than the E1 plant. These results are in accordance with results presented by Dias et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], showing that the internal rate of return (IRR) was higher with pentose fermentation than with biogas production from the pentoses in the integrated cases. In the present study, biogas upgrading to vehicle fuel quality was also investigated. It was shown that upgrading the biogas to vehicle fuel quality increased the NPV and IRR substantially for cases B1 and C5B1, due to that the price of biogas could be increased from 33 to 67 EUR/kWh (the revenue for the biogas increased by 50 % after upgrading to vehicle fuel quality Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This made the UB1 and UC5B1 cases more profitable than the case including only C6 fermentation and evaporation (E1 and B1). However, the biogas yield is a very important factor in this case.</p>
        <p>Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> also shows the MESP for the different cases. The MESP was found to be between 0.46 and 0.53 EUR/L, and decreased with C5 fermentation and biogas upgrading to vehicle fuel quality, compared to the corresponding C6 cases. The NPV is slightly higher for the C5B1 case than the E1 case, while the MESP is lower for the E1 case than for the C5B1 case; this is because a larger amount of co-products is produced in the E1 case (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The NPV and MESP were higher for the 1G case than the E1 case because natural gas had to be added in the 1G case. Also, a somewhat higher amount of DDGS was produced in the E1 case because some of the C5 sugars will end up in the DDGS. The NPV and the MESP for the 1G case does not correspond exactly to a commercial 1G plant since e.g., a more advanced combined head and power (CHP) plant configuration was used in the model, for comparison with the integrated cases, than that required for a stand-alone 1G plant. A survey performed for dry-mill corn to ethanol plants in U.S (in consistent years 2002 dollar) showed in general lower values for the capital cost than for the 1G plant in the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
        <p>The capital cost in the 1G case was about 66–76 % of the capital cost in the integrated cases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), indicating that the investment risk would be lower in the 1G case than in the integrated cases. However, it is found that increasing the scope of the substrate and products increased the revenue in all but the B1 case, compared with the 1G case. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> can also be useful when discussing the possibility of expansion, for example, adding a 2G process line to an existing 1G plant. However, the cost of changing the process from 1G to 1G + 2G must be taken into consideration, and this may vary depending on the configuration of the 1G plant.</p>

        <title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
        <p>Sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the effect on the NPV of changes in the process conditions, the cost of raw materials, and the price of the products, as well as variations in the discount rate.

Cases with 60 % biogas yield are indexed with “2” (E2, B2, C5E2, and C5B2)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
        <p>The NPV decreased in cases E2 and B2 when the biogas yield was reduced to 60 % of the theoretical (0.25 kg methane/COD) (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In case B2, a negative NPV was found when the biogas yield was decreased to 60 %. The difference in NPV between cases E2 and B2 also increased when the biogas yield was decreased, as the profit from selling the biogas was lower in the B2 case, while it was unaffected in the E2 case (as no biogas was sold). The change in NPV due to lower substrate conversion in anaerobic digestion indicated that it is important to study the biogas process in the biorefinery more closely. In the cases including C5 fermentation (C5E2 and C5B2), the difference in NPV was smaller when a reduced biogas production was assumed, since less C5 sugars were available for anaerobic digestion. Nonetheless, the C5E1 case had a higher NPV than the C5B1 case. However, the NPV also shows that the amount of biogas produced is more important in the C6 fermentation cases than in the combined C5 and C6 sugars (C5&amp;C6) fermentation cases. With regard to the IRR, it was found that cases C5E1, C5E2, UB1, UC5B1, and UC5B2 exhibited a higher IRR than the 1G case, implying that combined C5&amp;C6 fermentation and biogas upgrading to vehicle fuel quality are important when considering an integrated plant. However, all cases except B2 exhibited an IRR above 11 %.</p>
        <p>The results in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> also show that at a discount rate of 5 %, the NPV increased by between 130 and 410 % compared with the corresponding base case scenarios, and decreased by between 40 and 120 % at a discount rate of 14 %. The trends for the NPV at the higher and lower discount rates mainly followed the trends in the NPV for the base case scenarios. However, a higher cash flow will have a greater impact on the financial results when the discount rate is altered, compared with the corresponding base case scenario. Therefore, the E1 case, for example, will exhibit a higher NPV than the C5B1 case at a 5 % discount rate, and the 1G case a higher NPV than the E2 case at a 14 % discount rate.</p>
        <p>To assess the impact of variations in the cost of raw materials and the price of products, a sensitivity analysis was conducted by varying the prices from 0 to 300 % of those used in the corresponding base case scenarios. The variations in the cost of raw materials and prices of products are compiled in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> for cases B1 and E1, to visualize the magnitude of the different prices. The effects of varying the prices of ethanol, DDGS, and methane on the NPV for the various cases are presented in Figs. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9,</xref> and <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>The effects of costs and prices variations on the NPV for cases B1 and E1</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13068_2015_423_Fig7_HTML" id="MO7"/></fig><fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>NPV for each case at different ethanol prices</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13068_2015_423_Fig8_HTML" id="MO8"/></fig><fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>NPV for each case at different DDGS prices</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13068_2015_423_Fig9_HTML" id="MO9"/></fig><fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>NPV for each case at different methane prices</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13068_2015_423_Fig10_HTML" id="MO10"/></fig></p>
        <p>It can be seen from Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> that the ethanol and 1G raw material prices have significant effects on the NPV, mainly because of the large quantities of raw material and ethanol involved. The effect on the NPV will also vary with the amount of co-products produced. It should also be pointed out that a price variation of +200 % for ethanol (1.1 EUR/L) is not as likely for example, as an increase of 200 % in the price of DDGS (0.55 EUR/kg), which has been found to fluctuate considerably.</p>
        <p>The NPV decreased linearly with increasing cost of the raw material and yeast in all cases (data not shown). All the cases already showed a negative NPV at an increase in 1G raw material prices of 50 % (however, the effect of the possibility of a simultaneous increase in DDGS price was not accounted for). The amount of DDGS produced is also an important factor (see Figs. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), as the larger amount of DDGS produced in case E1 then in B1 gave a higher NPV at an increased DDGS price. The NPV decreased to zero in all cases when the price of 2G raw material was increased by 250 %. When the electricity price was varied, the largest effect on the NPV was seen in the scenarios where the most of the materials were incinerated, and therefore produced more electricity. The E1 case exhibited a lower NPV than the B1 case when the electricity price was decreased. However, all seven cases showed a positive NPV, even when the electricity price was set to zero.</p>
        <p>The NPV increased in all cases with increasing ethanol price; the highest NPVs being seen for cases C5E1 and UC5B1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). At an ethanol price of 110 % the NPV became higher for the C5B1 case than for the UB1 case, indicating that at a slightly higher ethanol price, C5&amp;C6 fermentation will be more beneficial than upgrading the biogas to vehicle fuel quality in the B1 case. At an ethanol price of 80 % of the base case price all the cases showed a negative NPV.</p>
        <p>It can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> that NPV increased in all cases when the price of DDGS was increased, since DDGS was produced in all cases. The increase in NPV was steepest in the G1, E1, and C5E1 cases, as the amount of DDGS produced in these cases was largest. The E1 case exhibited a higher NPV than the C5E1 case at about 300 % higher DDGS price than in the base case scenario, since slightly more DDGS was produced in the E1 case. When the price of DDGS was increased by more than 50 %, the 1G case exhibited a higher NPV than all the cases that were designed to produce biogas from the thin stillage.</p>
        <p>Cases B1 and C5B1 showed a higher NPV than cases E1 and C5E1 when the price of biogas was increased by 50–100 % of the base case price (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). The cases including evaporation (E1, C5E1, and G1) were not affected by these price changes as the biogas produced in the plants was used internally, and no internal price was assigned to that biogas. In cases where natural gas must be purchased, the price of natural gas was assumed to be constant. However, the production of biogas is important as it reduces the amount of external fuel required. All cases except B1 and UB1 showed a positive NPV, even when no revenue was included for the biogas produced in the process.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>When designing an integrated 1G + 2G plant, one of two main configurations can be chosen: that producing biogas or that producing DDGS. The choice depends mainly on the market for DDGS and biogas at the location of the plant. Since the prices of both DDGS and biogas have been fluctuating a great deal in recent years, a detailed market analysis must be performed before making any decisions. However, in the current study, a large amount of DDGS and combined C5&amp;C6 fermentation were found to be more promising than biogas production if the biogas was not upgraded to vehicle fuel quality. Furthermore, if legislation prevents the production of DDGS that includes genetically modified yeast, a separation step could be included in the 1G process before C5&amp;C6 fermentation to separate the solids from the liquid fraction. The solids can then be utilized for DDGS production without being mixed with the yeast. A decrease in the biogas yield from 80 to 60 % also largely affects the NPV. Therefore, it is important to perform more detailed experiments on biogas production from 1G + 2G substrates.</p>

        <p>The integrated plant was modeled assuming a 1G raw material loading of 360,000 tons dry grain per year and a 2G raw material loading of 180,000 tons dry wheat straw per year. These raw material loadings correspond to an estimated annual ethanol production of 200,000 m<sup>3</sup>, assuming C6 fermentation only. In some of the simulated cases, C5 fermentation was also considered, which increased the annual ethanol production to approximately 230,000 m<sup>3</sup>. It was assumed that the plant was in operation 8000 h per year, and could be managed by 28 people. One 1G case and six integrated 1G + 2G cases were modeled. In the integrated cases, ethanol, DDGS, and biogas production from the C5 sugars were investigated, as well as biogas upgrading to vehicle fuel quality. A sensitivity analysis was also performed for the six integrated cases to assess variations in the biogas yield which increased the investigated configurations to another six supplementary cases.</p>

        <p>Simulations were performed with the flow sheeting program Aspen Plus (version 8.2 from Aspen Technology Inc., Massachusetts, USA). Data for biomass components such as cellulose and lignin were retrieved from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) database developed for biofuel components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The NRTL-HOC property method was used for all units except in the heat and power production steam cycle, where STEAMNBS was used. The simulation models were further developments of previous work by Wingren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], Sassner and Zacchi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and Joelsson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Heat integration was implemented as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] using Aspen Energy Analyzer (version 8.2). The results from Aspen Plus were implemented in APEA, and were used together with vendors’ quotations to evaluate the capital and operational costs.

        <title>Raw materials</title>
        <p>Dry-milled WBG (1G material) with a wheat to barley ratio of 80:20 was kindly provided by Lantmännen Agroetanol. The WBG had a dry matter (DM) content of 89 %, which contained 76 % starch. The 2G material (wheat straw) used in the experiments was obtained from Johan Håkansson Lantbruksprodukter (Lunnarp, southern Sweden). The straw was first cut with a knife mill and then sieved to obtain particles of 2–10 mm. The straw consisted of approximately 91 % DM. The NREL method for determining structural carbohydrates and lignin content in biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] was used to determine the composition of the straw.</p>
        <p>The components of the dry raw materials are given in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Since all the components were not determined in the analysis, an average raw material composition was enlisted for both the 1G and the 2G materials, as this was required to close the mass balances for the simulations in Aspen Plus. The composition of the WBG was complemented with data estimated from the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and previously performed studies by Erdei et al.

        <title>General experimental procedure</title>
        <p>The experimental procedure consisted of steam pretreatment of dilute-H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-impregnated wheat straw, followed by liquid–solid separation of the material. The liquid part, containing most of the C5 sugars from the hemicellulose, was not processed further in the experimental study; however, in the simulations it was used in anaerobic digestion when C5 fermentation was not considered. The solid material was subsequently treated by EH. After EH, filtration was performed to separate the liquid fraction from the solid fraction, containing mainly lignin. The liquid fraction was then fermented with pre-liquefied and saccharified WBG. The proportion of straw to grain was 1:2.</p>

      <sec id="Sec14">
        <title>Steam pretreatment</title>
        <p>An aqueous solution of 0.2 wt% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> was used to impregnate the wheat straw for 1 h, using a liquid to dry straw weight ratio of 20:1. The impregnated straw was pressed to an average DM content of 53 % before being stored overnight in a sealed plastic bucket until pretreatment. Pretreatment was performed in a 10-L steam pretreatment unit described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], for 10 min at 190 °C, according to the findings of Linde et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The SPWS slurry was thoroughly mixed before being stored at 4 °C until it was pressed to a water-insoluble solid (WIS) content of 37 %.</p>
        <p>Triplicate samples were used to determine the DM and WIS contents of the SPWS. Standardized analytical NREL procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] were used to determine the total soluble sugars and degradation products in the liquid fraction of the SPWS and the carbohydrates and lignin in the solids.</p>
        <p>The pretreatment step was modeled with an RStoic reactor in Aspen Plus. The reactor was assumed to be operated as a continuous reactor into which 20-bar steam was injected at 190 °C. To account for heat losses and the void of the reactor, the steam consumption was increased by 10 % compared to an adiabatic unit. The outgoing material was assumed to be cooled by two-step flashing, at 4 and 1 bar. The main part of the flashed steam, which contains volatile compounds formed during pretreatment, was condensed and cooled before being fed to an anaerobic digestion unit and then a waste-water treatment unit. Part of the steam was recirculated and used to preheat the incoming wheat straw.</p>

          <title>WBG hydrolysate</title>
          <p>Two-step enzymatic hydrolysis (liquefaction and saccharification) was used to produce the WBG starch hydrolysate used in fermentation. Hydrolysis was performed in a 10-L evaporator (Büchi Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland) with a working weight of 7 kg in each batch. The WBG was mixed with water to achieve a DM of 35 % and then liquefied by thermostable α-amylases (Termamyl SC; Novozymes A/S, Bagsværd, Denmark) at 85 °C, pH 5.5 for 3 h, using an enzyme dosage of 0.5 g enzyme/kg DM WBG. After 3 h of liquefaction, the temperature was reduced to 60 °C, the pH was adjusted to 4.2, and amyloglucosidase (Spirizyme Fuel; Novozymes A/S) was added at a dosage of 1 mL/kg DM in order to saccharify the liquefied WBG for 24 h. To obtain a homogeneous material, all the batches were combined into one large batch. The WIS content and the carbohydrate concentrations in the hydrolyzed WBG were determined before fermentation.</p>

          <p>EH was performed on duplicate samples of the solid fraction of the pressed SPWS in a 30-L fermentor vessel (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland), using a total working weight of 15 kg. The pressed SPWS was diluted to a WIS concentration of 10 % before hydrolysis was performed with a Cellic CTec3 cellulase enzyme preparation (Novozymes A/S Bagsværd, Denmark) at an enzyme loading of 10 filter paper units (FPU)/g WIS. Hydrolysis was carried out for 96 h, at 45 °C, pH 5.0, and at a stirrer speed of 500 rpm. The pH was adjusted to 2 after EH to precipitate colloidal low molecular weight lignin and improve the separation of the solid and liquid fractions. The hydrolysate was then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min in several batches, which were mixed into one homogeneous batch. The pH of the hydrolysate was adjusted to five by the addition of NaOH, before fermentation. The washed solid fraction was analyzed to determine the carbohydrate, lignin, and ash contents.</p>

          <title>Experimental procedure</title>
          <p>Fermentation was carried out in duplicate batches using the 30-L fermentor vessels described above with a total working weight of 21.5 kg. The hydrolysate from the EH of the SPWS was autoclaved in 5-L bottles at 120 °C for 20 min before being added to the fermenters. A nutrient solution, consisting of a sterilized solution of 10.0 g (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> in water, was added to the vessel to give a final concentration of 0.5 g/L. The pH was maintained at 5 during fermentation with a 10 % NaOH solution, and fermentation was carried out for 120 h at 30 °C with stirring at 500 rpm. A cell suspension of conditioned Ethanol Red yeast (Fermentis, Marcq en Baroeul, France) was added to the fermentation vessel at a concentration of 3 g/L in the final liquid fraction to initiate fermentation of the EH supernatant from the SPWS. The glucose from the EH supernatant of the SPWS was depleted after 8 h, at which time feeding of the saccharified WBG solution was started and continued until 72 h. The feeding rate was 200 mL WBG/h, corresponding to the addition of approximately 50 g glucose to the fermentation vessel per hour. A commercial C6-fermenting yeast was used in the experiment since the main focus of the study was the hydrolysis and integrated fermentation of starch and cellulose material in a process development unit. However, lab-scale experiments on integrated grain and wheat straw fermentation using a co-fermenting strain have been performed, showing good conversion factors for both xylose and glucose to ethanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>

        <sec id="Sec20">
          <title>Simulations</title>
          <p>As earlier lab-scale experiments had shown good conversion of both C5 and C6 to ethanol, C6 fermentation as well as co-fermentation of C5&amp;C6 was modeled. The solid–liquid separation step that was carried out in the experiments after pretreatment was omitted in the simulated C5&amp;C6 co-fermentation cases. In the Aspen Plus model, it was assumed that both C6- and combined C5&amp;C6-fermenting yeast were cultivated on glucose from starch in a separate tank. The yeast production yield was assumed to be 0.5 g dry biomass/g glucose, and the pitch rate 3 g/L. It was assumed that commercially available enzymes were purchased for the hydrolysis of WBG and SPWS. EH and fermentation were modeled with RStoic reactors in Aspen Plus. The residence times were set to 24 h for the EH of SPWS, 28 h for the liquefaction and saccharification of WBG and 96 h for fermentation in the integrated cases. The cleaning and refilling times were set to 8 h, in the liquefaction and saccharification stage of WBG and to 12 h in the hydrolysis of the SPWS and the fermentation stages.</p>
          <p>The overall process conversion factor of glucose to ethanol from the raw materials was set to 0.80 based on the experimental results after withdrawing the sugar needed for yeast cultivation, since yeast cultivation was not included in the experiments. In the combined C5&amp;C6 fermentation, the xylose to ethanol conversion factor was set to 0.9 in the fermentation step, and a xylan to xylose conversion factor of 0.95 was used in EH, which was higher than that achieved in the experiment, but should be the aim in a future industrial plant. It was assumed in the simulations that 50 wt% of the xylan in the WBG was converted to xylose, due to hemicellulolytic activity in the amyloglucosidase preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The final ethanol concentrations in the broths obtained in the simulations of the fermentation of C6 and combined C5&amp;C6 sugars in the integrated plants were 9.6 and 10.8 wt%, respectively. The final ethanol concentration in the simulation of the 1G stand-alone plant before the distillation step was 11 wt%.</p>

        <title>Distillation</title>
        <p>It was assumed that a 25-stage, low-pressure stripper column followed by a 35-stage, high-pressure rectifying column, were used in the distillation process to concentrate the fermentation broth to 92.5 wt%. The ethanol stream was then dehydrated with molecular sieves to 99.5 wt%. A top-stage pressure of 0.3 bar and a Murphree efficiency of 50 % were assumed in the stripper column, and 1.3 bar and a 75 % Murphree efficiency in the rectifying column. The pressure was kept low in the stripper column to avoid gluten fouling, which can occur at higher temperatures. The rectifier was equipped with a partial-vapor condenser, where the heat from condensation was used to heat the stripper column. The overhead vapor from the rectifier was superheated and then concentrated to about 99.5 % in molecular sieve dehydration columns before cooling and storage. The reject stream from the molecular sieves was mixed with the condensed overhead vapor from the stripper column before being fed to the rectifier. The ethanol concentration in the rectifier feed was approximately 55 wt%, and the mass reflux ratio about 2.1.</p>

        <p>Thick stillage from the stripper columns, with a DM content of between 10 and 15 wt% (depending on the case), was filtered to attain a wet cake, consisting of solid particles with 45 wt% DM, and a thin stillage. The thin stillage contained between 6 and 11 wt% soluble DM. The filter unit was assumed to have a retention of solid particles of 95 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The thin stillage was then processed in two alternative ways. It was either sent to an evaporator, where it was concentrated to syrup before being mixed with the wet cake, and the overhead vapor was condensed and partly recirculated in the process. In the other alternative, the thin stillage was partly recirculated and the rest was subjected to anaerobic digestion, and only the wet cake was dried.</p>

        <p>Evaporation was modeled as a five-effect, forward-feed system. The boiling point elevation was accounted for using the expression derived by Larsson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Steam at 4 bar was used as heating medium and applied to the first evaporator operating at a pressure of 3 bar. The liquid fraction from the last evaporator unit was assumed to have a DM content of 60 wt%, and to leave the system at 0.2 bar.

        <p>A steam dryer was used to dry the incoming wet cake or the mixture of the wet cake and syrup to produce DDGS. The incoming material was dried with 4 bar superheated steam at 200 °C. Most of the outgoing steam from the dryer (90 %) was superheated and recirculated back to the dryer, and the remaining 10 % was condensed and fed to the anaerobic digestion stage. The outgoing solids from the dryer were assumed to have a DM content of 88 wt%.</p>

        <title>Anaerobic digestion</title>
        <p>The liquid fraction after pretreatment, the rectifier and the thin stillage, together with the condensed steam from the dryer, pretreatment and evaporation stages, were anaerobically digested for the production of biogas. Because experimental data regarding the exact substrate mixture are limited, some assumptions had to be made for the anaerobic digestion step, which could lead to some uncertainty in the model. However, Nkemka and Murto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] showed that 0.19 kg methane could be produced per kg COD from steam-pretreated, enzymatically hydrolyzed wheat straw in trial batch experiments. According to a review by Wilkie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] on ethanol stillage from conventional and cellulosic feedstock, stillage from cellulosic feedstock could result in a methane yield of 0.21 kg methane/kg COD, resulting in the removal of about 84 % of the COD. Anaerobic digestion was modeled as follows, assuming a theoretical methane production of 0.25 kg methane/kg COD. An RStoic reactor was set up in Aspen Plus in which total degradation of all the components in the incoming feed to the reactor was assumed, and the amount of oxygen required was calculated. A base case scenario was then set up assuming a COD removal of 80 %, which was multiplied by the theoretical methane production, resulting in a methane yield of 0.20 kg methane/kg COD (In addition a COD removal of 60 % was also used, to simulate a lower biogas production). The outgoing biogas stream consisted of 50 % methane, 46 % carbon dioxide, and 4 % water. The sludge generated in the anaerobic digestion step was combusted. Pressure swing absorption was used to upgrade the biogas to vehicle fuel quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p>

        <title>The stand-alone 1G plant</title>
        <p>The residence time in the fermentation step was set to 55 h, and the ethanol concentration in the broth after fermentation was set to 11 wt%. The cleaning cycle time in the fermentation step was the same as in the integrated cases. The raw material loading was increased to 55 ton DM/h to achieve the same ethanol production as in the integrated C6-fermenting cases. The CHP plant (described in Section “<xref rid="Sec28" ref-type="sec">Energy supply</xref>”<italic>)</italic> was used in the 1G plant. (The CHP unit included a high-pressure boiler, which means that the capacity of the steam supply system was higher than in a normal stand-alone plant utilizing natural gas, which is common for corn-based ethanol plants operating in the USA today.)</p>

      <title>Energy supply</title>
      <p>The heat and electricity required in the process were supplied by a co-located CHP. Superheated steam at 90 bar and 470 °C was produced by a boiler fueled by the solid residues, mainly lignin, generated in the solid separation step after the EH of SPWS, together with biogas and sludge produced in the anaerobic digestion step. If the process did not generate sufficient material for combustion, surplus energy in the form of natural gas (methane) was included in the simulations. The 1G case was run entirely on natural gas. Surplus energy could also be obtained by burning straw or other residual material instead of natural gas, since both systems exist. A steam turbine system was connected to the boiler to generate electricity. High-temperature steam required in the pretreatment and the drying steps was withdrawn at 20 bar, and medium-temperature steam was withdrawn at 4 bar to supply the rest of the process with heat. The isentropic and the mechanical efficiencies for the turbines were set to 90 and 97 %, respectively. The electricity demand of the plants was calculated from evaluations made using APEA and estimates specified in the manufacturers’ quotations. The electricity requirement of the process was then subtracted from the total amount produced in the plant, and any surplus was sold to the grid.</p>
      <p>The energy content was calculated using the LHV of the materials, obtained from the values of heat of combustion calculated in Aspen Plus. The LHV for the incoming materials WBG and straw were 15 and 19 MJ/kg DM, 11 MJ/kg DM for the enzymes, and 27, 50, and 16 MJ/kg DM for the outgoing products, ethanol, methane, and DDGS, respectively. The energy required for harvesting and transporting the raw materials an average distance of 50 km to the plant was set to 0.03 MJ/MJ dry biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The DM contents of grain, straw, and DDGS were set to 89, 91, and 88 %, respectively.</p>

      <p>The first case (1G), a stand-alone 1G plant, was modeled to produce the same amount of ethanol as the integrated C6-fermenting cases. Cases E1 and B1 were modeled using the experimental results obtained with a C6-fermenting yeast. In E1, the thin stillage generated after the separation step of the stillage from the distillation was concentrated by evaporation. The syrup generated was subsequently added to the solid fraction and dried to produce DDGS. In B1, the thin stillage was sent directly to the anaerobic digestion step to produce biogas, and only the solid fraction from the stillage was used for DDGS production. In cases C5E1 and C5B1, co-fermentation of C5&amp;C6 sugars was assumed, and the cases were modeled as for E1 and B1, respectively, from the separation step after distillation and downstream. The biogas yield was 80 % of the theoretical (0.25 methane/COD) in all the seven cases. In the C5E1 and C5B1, it was assumed that the DDGS could be sold as animal feed. However, this will depend on the yeast used and/or future regulations regarding genetically modified substances in animal feed. In the UB1 and UC5B1 cases, the surplus biogas was upgraded to vehicle fuel quality and thereby also the price of the biogas was increased.

      <title>Cost calculations</title>
      <p>Vendors’ quotations and APEA were used to calculate the capital cost of a plant located in Sweden. The energy and mass balances obtained from Aspen Plus were used to size the equipment. The costs for the following equipments were estimated based on vendors’ quotations; boiler, dryer and pelletizing equipment, molecular sieves, filter presses, anaerobic digestion, and pretreatment units. The chemical engineering plant cost index was used to update the prices to 2012 values. The price index for the calculations was based on 2012, and the construction time of the plant was 1 year. An exchange rate of 1 EUR = 9 SEK was used. The capital cost item included the cost of equipment and installation, civil construction, electricity installation, instrumentation, land, engineering, and fees associated with the investment cost. The operational cost item was based on Swedish conditions and separated into variable and fixed costs. Fixed costs included maintenance, insurance, working capital, and labor. The cost of working capital was determined according to recommendations in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and was assumed to be equivalent to an interest rate of 11 %. The costs of chemicals and utilities are given in Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. The costs are average values estimated after personal communication with companies and open source references. The cost of the enzymes in the 2G process was set to 3.0 EUR per million FPU, while for the 1G process it was 3.33 EUR/kg enzyme solution. The cost of enzymes for the 2G process was estimated based on figures from Novozymes assuming a cost of enzyme to be about 0.5 $/gallon ethanol produced from cellulosic material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The cost of the yeast license was set to 0.01 EUR/L ethanol produced.

      <p>Equation (<xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="">3</xref>) was used to calculate the NPV of the capital cost (<italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub>) and the operational costs, called the cash flow (CF), for an investment with a lifetime (<italic>n</italic>) of 20 years. A discount rate (<italic>r</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>) of 11 % was set in the base case scenarios. A straight line depreciation schedule with a period of 10 years was chosen for the investment in fixed assets.<disp-formula id="Equ3"><label>3</label><alternatives><tex-math id="M5">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

      <p>A MESP was calculated for the different cases by setting the NPV to zero. The MESP and the NPV were then used to evaluate the cases. The results of the calculations should primarily be used to compare the different cases with each other, and should not be taken as absolute values. A more detailed investigation is required for financial decisions.</p>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
      <p>Sensitivity analyses were performed for variations in the cost of raw materials, the prices of products, the biogas yield, and the discount rate, in order to investigate their effect on the NPV. The biogas yield was decreased by changing the COD removal from 80 % of the theoretical value (0.25 kg methane/kg COD at 100 %), to 60 % (0.15 kg methane/kg COD). The cases with 60 % biogas yield were indexed with “2”. The cost of raw materials and the selling prices of products were varied from 0 to 300 % for each case, compared with the costs and prices used in the base case scenario. In addition, the effects of varying the cost of yeast per L ethanol produced were investigated. The costs and prices were varied separately, so synergy effects were not considered. The base case scenario prices are presented in Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. The discount rate (11 % in the base case scenario) was varied from 5 % (risk-free asset) to 14 % (higher expected return).</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>HIV continues to pose a significant worldwide burden of morbidity and mortality. The advent of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) led to a paradigm shift of care and markedly improved outcomes in patients with HIV. Nevertheless, the global prevalence of HIV remains staggeringly high, and was estimated at 35.3 million in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Additionally, despite multi-disciplinary advances in prevention and treatment algorithms, nearly 40,000 new cases of HIV are reported annually in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, timely detection of HIV infection, particularly when viremia and transmissibility are high, is of considerable importance in continued efforts in both treatment and prevention of new infections. Novel fourth generation screening and confirmatory assays are now commercially available and incorporated into new diagnostic algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. We report two cases involving a total of three patients which highlight the spectrum of false positivity despite the introduction of these assays, and review the mechanisms and associations with false positivity that remain critical for the clinician’s interpretation.</p>

      <title>Case 1</title>
      <p>A 33 year old man presented with tender lateral neck swelling, cramping abdominal pain, and night sweats. He reported intra-nasal cocaine use and an instance of unprotected heterosexual contact in the preceding month. He denied intravenous drug use. On admission, he was afebrile with normal vital signs. His physical examination was significant for bulky adenopathy with submental, submandibular, cervical, inguinal, and axillary involvement. He also exhibited abdominal distention with hepatosplenomegaly.</p>
      <p>The initial laboratory examination was remarkable for a white blood cell count of 18,760 with 54 % lymphocytes, platelet count of 123,000, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 51 U/L, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 65 U/L. Haptoglobin was undetectable and lactate dehydrogenase was 743 U/L. HIV testing was performed singly and reactive by the Abbott Architect HIV antigen/antibody 4th generation screening assay (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA). Confirmatory testing using the Multispot HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Redmond, WA, USA), however, was nonreactive and an HIV viral load was undetectable. He had Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia with 4580 copies/mL detected. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of his neck demonstrated numerous bilateral non-necrotic lymph nodes within the jugular chain, the largest of which measured 1.6 cm. CT of his abdomen and pelvis revealed extensive bulky adenopathy throughout both the peritoneal and retroperitoneal spaces. An excisional biopsy was also performed on a submental lymph node which demonstrated florid follicular hyperplasia with interfollicular immunoblastic proliferation, hilar plasmacytosis, and an atypical T cell population, with some features of an angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. He had concurrent laboratory abnormalities that included positive rheumatoid factor, direct antiglobulin test, and hepatitis B IgM. Hepatitis B viral load was undetectable. A CD4 count was 1042 cells/µL but represented only 10 % of T lymphocytes. Peripheral flow cytometry was performed with findings consistent with multiple T-cell phenotypic abnormalities, which were thought to represent a lymphoproliferative process versus polyclonal reactive process due to immune dysfunction.</p>
      <p>After a multi-disciplinary review, the pathology of the biopsied lymph node was felt to represent reactive changes with atypical lymphocytes secondary to EBV infection without clear evidence of a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder. He was seen on several occasions in follow-up, and ultimately returned to his previous state of health. CT imaging revealed spontaneous resolution of lymphadenopathy. EBV viral load became undetectable and platelet counts normalized. While the patient’s age and previous multiple sexual partners made acute EBV infection less likely upon initial presentation, no alternative diagnosis was found.</p>

    <sec id="Sec3">
      <title>Case 2</title>
      <p>A 52 year old woman presented with 3 weeks of jaundice and increasing abdominal distension. The initial laboratory examination was remarkable for a white blood cell count of 24,000 with an absolute lymphocyte count of 0, hemoglobin of 5.6 g/dL, platelet count of 83,000, and an international normalized ratio of 2.7 in the absence of anticoagulant medications. Her metabolic panel revealed a sodium of 124 mmol/L, total bilirubin of 4.2 mg/dL, and a mild increase in AST at 72 U/L.</p>
      <p>A paracentesis was performed by the admitting physician. In the course of this procedure, the physician sustained a cut from a scalpel visibly soiled with patient blood. Per facility protocol, testing for blood-borne pathogens was performed on the patient. Hepatitis B and C serologies were nonreactive. HIV testing was performed singly using the Abbott Architect p24 antigen/antibody assay which resulted in positive. Confirmatory testing by Multispot antibody differentiation was positive for HIV-1 antibodies and negative for HIV-2 antibodies. On further interview, the patient denied a prior history of HIV testing. She denied previous blood transfusions, intravenous drug use, or tattoos. She endorsed two lifetime male sexual partners with inconsistent condom use.</p>
      <p>Her initial blood sample arrived to the laboratory with two different patient labels, so HIV testing was repeated on the same day with a different venipuncture using the Abbott Architect p24 antigen/antibody assay and the same results returned. Additional testing revealed an absolute CD4 count of 116 cells/µL corresponding to 61 % of her T lymphocytes and a CD4/CD8 ratio of 2.18. Potentially confounding conditions were evaluated yielding a negative urine human chorionic gonadotropin, negative anti-nuclear antibody, and negative toxoplasma IgG and IgM. An HIV viral load showed no detectable RNA and a qualitative proviral DNA test was also negative. A Western blot was sent and returned as indeterminate due to nonspecific background reactivity.</p>
      <p>Antiretroviral therapy was not initiated. CT of her abdomen showed innumerable peripherally enhancing and centrally necrotic hepatic lesions consistent with malignancy as well as enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes and spinal lesions consistent with metastases. A CEA and CA 19-9 were grossly elevated. The patient developed hemodynamically significant hematochezia requiring resuscitation with multiple units of blood products. She subsequently became hypoxic and hypotensive and required intubation with pressor support. After discussion with her family, support was withdrawn, the patient died, and the family declined autopsy.</p>
      <p>The physician who was exposed to blood was started on post-exposure prophylaxis with emtricitabine-tenofovir and raltegravir. His baseline Abbott Architect p24 HIV antigen/antibody test (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) performed singly on the same day as the aforementioned patient was reactive. As with the patient, the confirmatory Multispot antibody differentiation test which was drawn from a separate blood sample was also positive for HIV-1 but not HIV-2. An HIV viral load and qualitative proviral DNA test were both negative. He continued post-exposure prophylaxis for 1 week and then discontinued these medications. Follow up testing 6 months after exposure was negative on both HIV antigen/antibody test and proviral DNA.</p>
      <p>In further review of specimen handling and processing, the patient and physicians blood samples were not shipped to the facility laboratory together as they had distinct origins from the medical intensive care unit and emergency department respectively. Due to concerns for mislabeling of the patients initial blood sample, repeat testing was performed with a separate venipuncture which yielded the same results. Given the congruent laboratory results from separate blood samples, no corrective action reports were filed from the laboratory on that day.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We report the cautionary spectrum of false positive HIV diagnostics in three patients (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In case one, a false positive fourth generation test was not confirmed by antibody differentiation or by nucleic acid amplification testing, representing a common scenario often observed with prior generations of HIV diagnostics. Yet, in case two, we report one likely and one confirmed false positive result which occurred with both the antigen/antibody assay and with a confirmatory HIV antibody differentiation test.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of diagnostic test results and proposed mechanisms of false positivity</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left">Abbott p24 antigen/antibody</th><th align="left">MultiSpot HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation</th><th align="left">HIV proviral DNA</th><th align="left">HIV RNA viral load</th><th align="left">Alternative diagnosis/mechanism of false positivity</th><th align="left">Other explanatory studies/reports</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Case 1</td><td align="left">Positive</td><td align="left">Non-reactive</td><td align="left">Not done</td><td align="left">Negative</td><td align="left">EBV infection and reactive lymphocytosis</td><td align="left">[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Case 2 patient</td><td align="left">Positive</td><td align="left">Reactive to HIV-1</td><td align="left">Negative</td><td align="left">Negative</td><td align="left">Metastatic cancer</td><td align="left">[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Case 2 exposed health care provider</td><td align="left">Positive</td><td align="left">Reactive to HIV-1</td><td align="left">Negative</td><td align="left">Negative</td><td align="left">Healthy/query poor specificity of individual test kit</td><td align="left">[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Case 2 exposed health care provider (6 month follow up)</td><td align="left">Negative</td><td align="left"/><td align="left">Negative</td><td align="left">Negative</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
      <p>Following HIV transmission, markers of infection can be detected by diagnostic assays in a predictable fashion. An ‘eclipse phase’ typically lasting 10–14 days is characterized by infection in local mucosal and lymphoreticular tissue during which systemic viremia is not detected. Approximately 7 days later, viral RNA becomes present in serum at quantities detectable by nucleic acid amplification. Capsid protein p24 is the next chronological measurable component of acute infection by way of detection of soluble antigen. Approximately 5 days after detection of p24 antigen, seroconversion occurs and anti-HIV antibody becomes evident by reactive results to various available ELISA assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Various commercial fourth generation tests are available for use, all of which utilize the combined detection of p24 antigen and HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody. Ly et al. performed a large analysis to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of various fourth generation tests. Numerous assays including the Abbott Architect p24 HIV antigen/antibody test (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) were able to detect infection prior to p24 antigen assays and in fewer than 3 days after nucleic acid testing while maintaining a specificity of greater than 99 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Fourth generation tests can effectively shorten the time frame in which HIV infection is undetectable prior to seroconversion. While reported sensitivity and specificity of fourth generation tests remain higher than 99 % in numerous studies, several instances of discordance between screening and confirmatory techniques have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Lee et al. performed a comparative analysis of commercially available 3rd and 4th generation screening assays in effort to evaluate the specificity and false positivity of the newer 4th generation assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Four seroconversion panels were included for analysis including a batch of serum samples previously known to have produced discordant results between screening and confirmatory testing. Of the 54 known false positive serum samples, all 54 demonstrated continued discordance with 3rd generation testing, while 34 instances were reported with the 4th generation assay. Patients from whom discordant samples were obtained also had various concurrent clinical conditions including rheumatologic diseases, viral hepatitis, malignancy, infection with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, a history of multiple pregnancies, and recent <italic>Rickettsia</italic> infection, conditions which have been similarly associated with false positive screening tests in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Shida et al. describe a patient with a reactive 4th generation HIV diagnostic secondary to an angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the lymphoproliferative disease originally suspected in “Case 1”. Various other phenomena were concurrently reported to cause false positive results including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, high anti-nuclear antibody titers, and a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Importantly for roll-out of diagnostics for other HIV endemic countries, discordance between serologic screening tests and confirmatory assays have also been demonstrated in the setting of elevated IgG antibodies to <italic>Schistosoma</italic> species in a study of adolescents in Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>The new Multispot antibody differentiation test has been reported to have sensitivity and specificity greater than 99 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], comparing favorably with traditional Western blotting as a confirmatory assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Yet as Case 2 demonstrates, false positive results have been reported, more commonly with HTLV-I, HTLV-II, toxoplasmosis, and SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It is biologically plausible that conditions which would yield a false-positive 4th generation antigen/antibody assay could similarly cause a false positive antibody differentiation assay. Remarkably however, in Case 2, the false positive screening and confirmatory testing was observed not only for a patient with a likely malignancy but also for the healthcare worker with no known complicating health problems. This suggests that the etiology of the erroneous result may not have been intrinsic to the patient and, indeed, may have been secondary to reduced specificity of the batch of testing kits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>In 2014, the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) updated recommendations for the diagnosis of HIV infection to include a novel algorithm using the fourth generation screening and confirmatory assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Initial screening should begin with a combination immunoassay or fourth generation test that utilizes detection of both HIV-1/HIV-2 antibodies with HIV-1 p24 antigen. Negative results conclude testing, while reactive results necessitate further testing with a HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay. Specimens that demonstrate reactivity on the initial screening immunoassay, but negative or indeterminate results on antibody differentiation assay, should undergo nucleic acid testing. In this report, the CDC algorithm guided the clinicians to the correct identification of a false positive test in Case 1. In the second case, on the other hand, the algorithm would have led to two incorrect HIV diagnoses with the potential for substantial harm.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="Sec5">
      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Rapid HIV diagnostics such as fourth generation antigen/antibody assays and HIV antibody differentiation assays permit the identification of increased numbers of recent HIV infections and can help facilitate faster entry into care. While these testing modalities have high reported sensitivity and specificity, like all tests, they remain imperfect. CDC guidelines have been issued to assist clinicians in the interpretation of these results, but these cases emphasize that correct use of the algorithm continues to require careful clinical judgment.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Forging a partnership between the traditionally distinct disciplines of informatics and epidemiology is becoming increasingly necessary. Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of disease. Traditionally, epidemiology has focused on univariate analysis and studied single or a small number of risk determinants and their relationship to health outcomes. However, given the multifactorial and complex nature of chronic diseases, such as cancer, epidemiology has shifted its focus from single risk factors to multilevel conceptual frameworks of health that serve to integrate and study multiple risk factors and how they interact across 3 main levels: 1) the macro-environment, defined by factors outside an individual, such as where a person lives, their family/social circumstances , and environmental exposures; 2) the individual, which includes behaviors, such as smoking, and psychosocial factors; 3) biology, which includes the study of genes and other biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Similar to the biologic concept of epistasis, understanding which risk factors are most relevant to disease and their interactions is exceedingly convoluted within one level, let alone across multiple levels. Further, few existing population and clinic-based study samples include risk factor information at each of these levels. Thus, it is difficult to test these conceptual frameworks from both a data availability and analytic standpoint.</p>
    <p>Epidemiology could benefit from entering the “big data” arena and has begun to do so with studies at the biologic level. Advances in –omic technologies have led to the generation of large datasets in genomics and proteomics; however, publically available datasets that contain risk factor information at both the individual and macro-environmental level remain untapped and underutilized. For instance, U.S. Census and U.S. Consumer Spending data could be combined with existing clinical biorepositories and linked through a geocode to test hypotheses related to the interaction of the macro-environment and biology in disease etiology and prognosis. A recent report of emerging macrotrends in Epidemiology suggests that data integration and generation of large social, environmental, and clinical datasets should be a core competency in epidemiologic training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the creation of these enormous datasets is futile without the ability to analyze and manipulate big data.</p>
    <p>Analyzing big data requires knowledge and execution of data mining techniques. Like most biomedical sciences, epidemiology relies heavily on reductionist approaches that use standard regression models (i.e. linear, logistic, multilevel) based on statistical assumptions that may not reflect the true nature of how a risk factor or group of risk factors influence disease etiology and prognosis. For example, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have yielded new insights into disease processes, but have proven to have little prognostic value, perhaps due to a stringent emphasis on identifying true positives, as well as a focus on the analysis of univariate as opposed to joint effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Complex Systems approaches and agent-based modeling (ABM) have become increasing popular in epidemiologic investigations, given their focus on interactions or joint effects. ABM is a type of systems algorithmic approach that accounts for the recognition of feedback, interference, change over time, and nonlinearities among risk factors <italic>a priori</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], based on existing knowledge and observation, but it is not a true data mining technique that can identify novel risk factors or groups of risk factors empirically.</p>
    <p>Epidemiology is in need of more powerful modeling approaches that relax model assumptions and allow for more empiric investigations of large scale, joint biologic, social, and genetic datasets. Biological data mining approaches, particularly those related to artificial intelligence and machine learning, could address current epidemiologic limitations and are starting to be explored in population-based studies that include patient and biologic level data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These approaches are model-free, nonparametric, and allow for high performance computing that can incorporate artificial intelligence approaches with human knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Some machine learning approaches, such as neural networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and learning classifier systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], have demonstrated an added statistical benefit, as well as revealed effects missed by traditional regression frameworks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While one of the limitations of machine learning algorithms has been validation and interpretation of findings, epidemiology often plays an important role in evaluating inferential statistical methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, the computational capacity offered by machine learning algorithms, which can allow for the identification of complex interactions across multiple data levels and multiple risk factors, warrants further study in epidemiologic investigations.</p>
    <p>Epidemiology and informatics can be linked through common data mining methods applied across macro-environmental, individual, and biologic data sources. A partnership with epidemiology would expand the application and reach of data mining methods beyond just genomic or proteomic investigations. Applying big data approaches, namely the creation of large scale datasets from existing resources, as well as data mining methods (i.e. those related to machine learning), to test hypotheses related to epidemiologic, multilevel conceptual models will likely have implications for improving understanding of disease etiology and prognosis. Informatics can aid in methods development and epidemiology can assess the precision, accuracy, and effectiveness of inferences made using big data approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, an Epidemiology-Big Data collaboration is of mutual benefit to both groups, and it is the goal of <italic>BioData Mining</italic> to foster these type of collaborations.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Smoking is the most important reversible cardiovascular risk factor. It is well established that quitting smoking reduces coronary events. However, on several occasions, the cardiovascular safety of smoking cessation drugs has been questioned. Our goal is to evaluate the effects of smoking cessation drugs on blood pressure and heart rate in patients from a smoking cessation service in a cardiology hospital.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>We examined the PAF database (Smoking Cessation Assistance Program database) between January 2008 and March 2014. We analyzed data from 900 patients who were compliant with the treatment (50.5 % male, average age 53 ± 17 years). The most frequent clinical diagnoses were coronary artery disease (25.2 %), hypertension (57.2 %), and diabetes (13.4 %). Blood pressure, heart rate, and carbon monoxide (CO) concentration in exhaled air were analyzed at consecutive visits during the first 45 days of treatment (mean visits - 3). Analysis of repeated measures was used for the statistical analysis (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Two hundred seventy one patients used nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) alone, 81 used bupropion alone, 154 used varenicline alone, 283 used NRT plus bupropion and 111 used bupropion plus varenicline. For all smoking cessation drugs, used alone or in combination, no increase occurred in the average value of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Significant reductions in CO concentrations occurred in all smoking cessation drug groups.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Smoking cessation drugs used in monotherapy or in combined regimens did not influence systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) in this group of patients during the observation period.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Smoking cessation substantially lowers the risk of death in patients of all ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], including those with cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The long-term cardiovascular benefits of smoking cessation are well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Clinical practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] recommend the use of cessation pharmacotherapy for smokers interested in quitting. The first-line drugs for smoking cessation are nicotine replacement therapy (NRT - gum or patch), bupropion (Zyban, Wellbutrin) and varenicline (Chantix, Champix).</p>
      <p>These medications demonstrated effectiveness in achieving complete smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], but their safety in patients with cardiovascular (CV) disease has been questioned and evaluated in several studies and meta-analyses. Previous reports associated NRT use with occurrence of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction, especially in patients who continued smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, two recent meta-analyses showed an increase in CV symptoms, including tachycardia and nonspecific chest pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] but not in MACEs - defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. With bupropion, trials including smokers with cardiovascular disease did not report a statistically significant increase in CV events compared to placebo. However, the sample sizes were small and not powered for safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>A recent network meta-analysis of 21 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) showed that bupropion was not harmful for MACEs and appeared to have a cardioprotective effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Varenicline, an alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, binds to the same receptors as nicotine, which is known to have sympathomimetic cardiovascular effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The first meta-analysis on the CV safety of varenicline, predominantly composed of trials excluding patients with CV disease, concluded that increased risk (72 %) exists for minor and major cardiovascular events among tobacco users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A more recent large meta-analysis with more than 9,000 patients, however, found no significant risk of major CV events associated with varenicline use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Trials that included patients with a history of CV disease found that even in a higher risk population, varenicline did not add significant damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>There are few studies evaluating combination of therapies for smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], none of them evaluating safety in patients with cardiovascular disease. One of these studies excluded patients with cardiovascular diseases or history of hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In the other studies there were not reports of major or minor adverse cardiovascular events during the smoking cessation therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There is not meta-analysis available in the literature until this moment.</p>
      <p>We examined CV effects of these drugs on blood pressure and heart rate in outpatient setting according to different combination therapies and the previous presence of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and/or acute myocardial infarction.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>We analyzed 900 outpatient subjects followed at the Smoking Cessation Program of the Heart Institute (InCor), University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Most of the patients have cardiovascular diseases or high risk score. We used the PAF database (Smokers Assistance Program) between January 2008 and March 2014 and looked up subjects of both genders older than 18 years of age. The Ethics Committee for Research Project Evaluation (CAPPesq) of the Hospital das Clinicas – School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, approved the study. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. They agreed with the informed consent form.</p>
      <p>During the study period, 1791 patients were enrolled to the service. However, 891 patients were excluded because they did not come in the consecutive visits and their data for BP, HR, and/or CO were not available. However, patients with analyzed data (<italic>n</italic> = 900) did not have significant differences in their SBP, DBP, HR and CO values (125 ± 21 mmHg; 76 ± 12 mmHg; 74 ± 13 bpm; 11 ± 10 ppm) compared with data of the untreated patients (<italic>n</italic> = 891) (123 ± 22 mmHg; 74 ± 18 mmHg; 74 ± 18 bpm; 12 ± 12 ppm) (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).</p>
      <p>Thus, 900 patients were included in this analysis. They received smoking cessation medication to be taken for at least 12 weeks. Among the available medications, there were nicotine replacement therapies (NRT — patch and gum), bupropion, and varenicline. In the first visit (baseline), the patient was not in use of any drug for smoking cessation. One of these drugs was prescribed as monotherapy according to the nicotine dependence level, previous use of smoking cessation drugs, availability of the medication and lack of absolute contraindication related to each drug. Varenicline was prescribed for patients who failed in previous attempts with NRT and/or bupropion, or who smoked one or more packs of cigarettes per day.</p>
      <p>The gap between follow-up visits was 2 to 3 weeks. In all visits the patient were questioned about smoking status, compliance and collateral effects of the medication prescribed, and we evaluated the vital signs, CO level, and withdrawal symptoms.</p>
      <p>In the second visit, the patients who achieved success with monotherapy and had no or mild withdrawal symptoms were kept with the same medication. The patients who did not achieve success and the patients who achieved complete cessation but with moderate or intense withdrawal symptoms had associated therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>The data were categorized in 3 visits in sequential follow-up, called initial (baseline), second, and third visits. Variables from the database included in the analysis were: age; sex; smoking cessation; smoking cessation drugs used; smoker’s degree of nicotine dependence according to the Fagerström score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and Issa score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] at the initial visit; presence or absence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2) and coronary artery disease (CAD); acute myocardial infarction (AMI); obesity, heart failure, arrhythmias, or valvular heart disease; and the number of cardiovascular medications being used at the initial visit. All the visits and measurements were done during the afternoon period. In each visit, the median of 2 blood pressures was taken with a mercury sphygmomanometer, and heart rate and exhaled CO level were collected. The parameter we used for smoking cessation was CO level below 6 ppm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] associated with the self-reported cessation. The data regarding systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) of study patients were compared for initial, second, and third visits, according to smoking cessation drugs used, alone or in combination, as well as between 2 groups: first with the presence of hypertension, CAD, and/or AMI and second without all these diseases.</p>

      <p>During the study, 900 patients were included in the analysis. The median age of patients was 53 ± 17 and 50.5 % were male. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows demographic and clinical characteristics. Smoker’s degree of nicotine dependence was 6.3 ± 2.3 assessed by Fagerström score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and 2.9 ± 0.9 by Issa score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. From the 900 patients included, 580 (64.4 %) had hypertension, CAD, and/or AMI. Hypertension was the most common cardiovascular disease (57.2 %), and a significant number of patients had coronary artery disease (25.2 %) and previous acute myocardial infarction (27.0 %).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics of study patients</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Variables</th><th>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>It is well known that quitting smoking can reduce the risk of mortality from heart disease and acute myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, studies regarding CV risks associated with pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation have been concerned with public health. Few randomized controlled trials have been conducted in populations with high cardiovascular risk profiles and also few trials have compared head-to-head the safety of smoking cessation medications.</p>
      <p>We did not observe any significant change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure and heart rate in 900 patients who used smoking cessation therapies and were followed at Heart Institute, a cardiac hospital with a large rate of patients with hypertension, CAD, and/or AMI. This result was regardless of the combination of pharmacotherapies used in the smoking cessation treatment and the presence or absence of cited comorbidities.</p>
      <p>In the literature, tachycardia is a well-established and benign adverse effect observed in a lot of studies using NRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Some studies showed an increase in HR (10–15 beats/min) and blood pressure (5–10 mmHg) after NRT use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], even in smokers who interrupted tobacco consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis showed similar results - an association of using NRT and increasing minor CV events, mainly due to the occurrence of tachycardia, but without adding risk to major CV events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In patients with a history of a predisposing high-risk condition, in a smaller sample, this was not found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The development of tolerance to blood pressure effects of nicotine in heavy smokers can be included in these divergent hemodynamic findings.</p>
      <p>Concerning bupropion, an increase in blood pressure could be an important cardiovascular side effect, regardless of pre-existing hypertension, because of the effect of bupropion on the reuptake of norepinephrine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, this effect is not seen overall in clinical practice and our results are in accordance with the results from other studies. Settle et al, enrolling more than 500 patients with depression, did not show clinically important effects on BP or HR when bupropion was compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In patients with CV diseases, a randomized trial including 248 smokers hospitalized because of CAD did not find a significant change in blood pressure after 12 weeks of slow release (SR) bupropion compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A clinical trial with 629 persistent smokers with CV disease, in which nearly half had experienced an AMI previously, evaluated bupropion versus placebo and did not find significant changes in BP or HR. Patients with baseline BP ≥ 160/100 mmHg were excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In another study with 300 outpatient smokers with untreated stage 1 hypertension, different doses of bupropion induced a small reduction in BP, and bupropion 400 mg SR also increased heart rate by 2.9 beats/min versus placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. On the other hand, studies by Roose et al with small samples observed that bupropion can increase sympathomimetic activity and increase HR and BP in patients with depression and heart disease if it is used in higher doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the same way, Tonstad et al reported no changes in BP after 24 weeks of varenicline versus placebo. The mean HR remained similar in the varenicline group and decreased by 2 beats per minute in the placebo group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Additionally, a randomized trial with 714 smokers with stable CV disease (history of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, angina pectoris, peripheral arterial vascular disease, stroke or transient ischemic attack) showed a 0.5 mmHg increase in SBP and no changes in DBP and HR in the varenicline group versus placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>There are some studies with the use of NRT in population of smokers without cardiovascular diseases or with hypertension alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which did not find changes in HR and BP.</p>
      <p>This study has some limitations. BP and HR were measured at 3 consecutive visits. Therefore, although it is enough to have a comparison, possible small changes might be seen in a more prolonged follow. Compliance with the treatment and smoking status were measured during the follow-up period by asking patients and by measuring exhaled CO level, which showed a significant reduction in comparison with basal CO level, regardless of pharmacotherapy used. It indicates reduction or cessation of smoking. We did not design a study with the objective and power to observe major CV events.</p>
      <p>Our findings of maintenance of BP and HR in a relatively large population of smokers with and without preexisting stable CV diseases using different combinations of smoking cessation therapies are important as a safety data for clinical practice. This result is in agreement with a recent meta-analysis of the use of NRT, bupropion and varenicline, which did not find an increase in major CV events with all drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In patients with CV diseases, the existing data do not suggest harm and the benefits of smoking cessation in the long term exceeds an eventual small risk associated with pharmacotherapy drugs for smoking cessation.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Our data from a real clinical practice suggest that, even in patients with hypertension, CAD, and/or AMI, there are no significant clinical change in blood pressure or heart rate during the use of NRT, varenicline, and/or bupropion.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) provides crucial breeding materials that facilitate hybrid seed production in various crops, and thus plays an important role in the study of hybrid vigor (heterosis), in plants. However, the CMS regulatory network in soybean remains unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in flower and pollen development by targeting genes that regulate their expression in plants. To identify the miRNAs and their targets that exist in the soybean CMS line NJCMS1A and its maintainer NJCMS1B, high-throughput sequencing and degradome analysis were conducted in this study.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Two small RNA libraries were constructed from the flower buds of the soybean CMS line NJCMS1A and its maintainer NJCMS1B. A total of 105 new miRNAs present on the other arm of known pre-miRNAs, 23 new miRNA members, 158 novel miRNAs and 160 high-confidence soybean miRNAs were identified using high-throughput sequencing. Among the identified miRNAs, 101 differentially expressed miRNAs with greater than two-fold changes between NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B were discovered. The different expression levels of selected miRNAs were confirmed by stem-loop quantitative real-time PCR. A degradome analysis showed that 856 targets were predicted to be targeted by 296 miRNAs, including a squamosa promoter-binding protein-like transcription factor family protein, a pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein, and an auxin response factor, which were previously shown to be involved in floral organ or anther development in plants. Additionally, some targets, including a MADS-box transcription factor, NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 24 kDa subunit, were identified, and they may have some relationship with the programmed cell death, reactive oxygen species accumulation and energy deficiencies, which might lead to soybean male sterility.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>The present study is the first to use deep sequencing technology to identify miRNAs and their targets in the flower buds of the soybean CMS line NJCMS1A and its maintainer NJCMS1B. The results revealed that the miRNAs might participate in flower and pollen development, which could facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind CMS in soybean.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>In higher plants, cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a natural phenomenon resulting from maternal inheritance, mainly by mitochondrial genes and nuclear gene interactions, which lead to pollen abortion but normal pistil development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. At present, ~200 species of plants are known to exhibit CMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which has been widely used in crops, especially in rice heterosis utilization and crop breeding. Many studies have reported that CMS-related genes are located in the mitochondrial genome, and that its F<sub>1</sub> hybrid fertility could be recovered by a restorer gene or genes originating in the nuclear genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In 1985, CMS in soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic> (L.) Merr.) was first reported by Davis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and further characterized by Sun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. At present, a variety of soybean CMS lines, such as NJCMS1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and NJCMS2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], have been developed. With the construction of three lines, CMS, maintainer and restorer, of soybean, many soybean hybrids have been successfully cultivated.</p>
      <p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, endogenous ~21-nt non-coding RNAs. In plants, they are processed from single-stranded RNA precursors that can form stem-loop regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These miRNAs play a critical role in nearly all biological processes: development, differentiation, and biotic and abiotic stress responses in higher plants, via the degradation or translational inhibition of target mRNAs at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. miRNAs have been discovered using three basic approaches: direct cloning, forward genetics and bioinformatics predictions with experimental validation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In recent years, degradome sequencing has been used to identify global targets of miRNAs in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
      <p>To date, hundreds of miRNAs have been isolated by direct cloning or deep sequencing in soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], but the number of miRNAs known in soybean is still very small and considerably lower than in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> or rice. Additionally, in the past several years, the miRNAs associated with CMS, genetic male sterility or male sterility in plants have been studied, and the results showed that the miRNAs helped regulate male sterility and fertility restoration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, as a widely planted oil crop worldwide, the roles of miRNAs in soybean CMS remain largely unknown. Thus, the identification of miRNAs and the elucidation of their functions in pollen development will help us understand the molecular mechanisms of soybean CMS. Here, we examined and compared the expression profiles of miRNAs in the flower buds of a soybean CMS line NJCMS1A and its maintainer NJCMS1B, using high-throughput sequencing. We also applied degradome sequencing to identify genes targeted by identified miRNAs and analyzed their possible functions. The results may indicate that there were some interactions between miRNAs and their targets, therefore flower bud or pollen development could be influenced by the biogenesis of miRNAs in CMS.</p>

In miRBase 21.0, 573 soybean pre-miRNAs correspond to 639 mature miRNAs.

        <title>Identification of newly conserved soybean miRNA families and new miRNA members</title>
        <p>All unannotated small RNA sequences that matched soybean genome sequences were mapped to known plant miRNAs in miRBase to identify newly conserved miRNA families and new miRNA members. If the small RNAs matched known plant miRNAs with no more than four mismatches, they were classified as candidate conserved miRNAs and new miRNA members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Four characteristics of miRNAs, described in Methods, were used to screen the candidate conserved miRNAs and new miRNA members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Unfortunately, no new conserved miRNA families were found in the present study. However, 23 new miRNA members, belonging to nine known miRNA families (five conserved and four non-conserved miRNA families; Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), were discovered in the two small RNA libraries (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). These 23 miRNAs have not been reported as gma-miRNAs in miRBase before but were homologous to known plant miRNAs. The length of most miRNAs was 21 nt, with only one miRNA having a length of 22 nt, which conformed to a common characteristic of plant miRNAs. For N-gma-miR164r, N-gma-miR399i and N-gma-miR399k, both miRNA-3p and miRNA-5p were simultaneously found on the two arms of their pre-miRNAs. Of seven new miRNA members that belonged to MIR164, six shared the same mature sequence, and they had only one base different from gma-miR164r-5p. However, their precursors came from different loci of the soybean genome. A similar result was found for the MIR399 and MIR4380 families (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The precursor sequences of N-gma-miR164l and N-gma-miR164n, as well as N-gma-miR164m and N-gma-miR164p, were highly similar to each other (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

        <p>To predict novel miRNAs in soybean, we used MIREAP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://source-forge.net/projects/">https://source-forge.net/projects/</ext-link> mireap/) to explore the secondary structures, Dicer cleavage sites and minimum free energies (MFEs) of the unannotated small RNA sequences that could be mapped to the soybean genome. The unannotated small RNAs that map to the soybean genome, but not to known plant miRNAs, were classified as candidate novel miRNAs. Four criteria described in Methods were used to increase the predictive accuracy. A total of 158 new miRNAs, belonging to 111 novel families (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), were identified in this study. Among them, 20 novel miRNAs on both arms of the pre-miRNAs were identified. The lengths of the mature miRNAs ranged from 20 to 23 nt, and most of them were 21 nt. The precursors of these novel miRNAs were identified by MIREAP and varied from 66 to 354 nt in length, with MFE values ranging from −20.7 to −181.1 kcal/mol (−0.23 to −0.86 kcal/mol/nt). The minimal folding energy indices (MFEI) ranged from 0.85 to 2.14, with 85.53 % of them being greater than 0.97 and the average being 1.32, which is consistent with miRNA. Most of the new mature miRNA sequences (73.58 %) presented a uracil (U) as the first nucleotide. This is in agreement with previous results for soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Like new miRNA members, some of the novel miRNAs, such as novel_mir_018a to novel_mir_018f, shared the same mature sequences but had different precursors that came from different loci. The novel-MIR15 had two sub-members (novel_mir_015a and novel_mir_015b). Unlike known miRNAs, the expression levels of the novel miRNAs were very low. The information for all of the novel miRNAs is summarized in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S6. The secondary structure for the precursor of novel_mir_51 was used as an example in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, and the others are shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S5.</p>

To be annotated as a high-confidence miRNA, in addition to the four characteristics of miRNAs described in Methods, a locus must meet the following criteria: first, at least 10 reads map to each of the two mature sequences (miRNA-5p and miRNA-3p), or at least five reads map to each arm and at least 100 reads are mapped in total (miRBase 21.0); and second, at least 50 % of the reads mapping to each arm of the hairpin precursor must have the same 5′ end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Through a combined analysis of known miRNAs with their new 5p or 3p miRNAs, 156 known miRNAs and four novel miRNAs could be annotated as high-confidence miRNAs, representing 23.46 % and 2.53 % of known miRNAs (including new 5p or 3p miRNAs) and novel miRNAs in this study, respectively (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S7).

        <p>The stem-loop qRT-PCR was conducted to validate and measure the expression profiles of the nine selected differentially expressed miRNAs. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, seven of them were consistent with the sequencing reads. However, novel_mir103 and gma-miR397a were found to be up-regulated in NJCMS1A, but were enriched in NJCMS1B based on the high-throughput sequencing analysis. The trend was not consistent with that of deep sequencing, possibly because of the low expression levels in the two samples and the difference in sensitivity between qRT-PCR and high-throughput sequencing technology.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Expression levels of selected miRNA in NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B.

        <title>Identification of miRNA target genes in NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B using a degradome analysis</title>
        <p>Two independent degradome libraries derived from flower buds of NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B were constructed and sequenced. A total of 12 351 703 and 12 671 179 raw reads were generated from the NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B libraries, respectively (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). After removing the adaptor sequences and/or low-quality reads present in the raw reads, 12 288 476 and 12 613 736 clean reads in the NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B libraries, respectively, were obtained, of which 10 954 689 (89.15 %) and 11 289 967 (89.51 %) were perfectly matched to the soybean genome (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Moreover, 98.69 % of the clean reads in NJCMS1A and 98.82 % of the clean reads in NJCMS1B were 20 and 21 nts in length, which matched the length distribution peak of the degradome fragments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Length distributions of degradome library clean reads in flower buds of NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2015_2352_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p>
        <p>Based on the distribution of splice sites near raw sequence tags, the splice sites could be divided into five categories: 0 to 4 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S9 and Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In total, 856 targets were predicted to be cleaved by 296 miRNAs. Furthermore, 28 novel miRNAs were shown to cleave 81 targets (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S10). The targets of all of the miRNAs are listed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S9. These targets included a squamosa promoter-binding protein-like transcription factor family protein, pentatricopeptide repeat-containing (PPR) protein, MADS-box protein, GAMYB protein, auxin response factor, no apical meristem protein, homeobox-leucine zipper protein, nuclear transcription factor Y, transcription factor CCAAT, GRAS family transcription factor, transcription factor APETALA2, TCP transcription factor, F-box family protein, growth-regulating factor, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family protein, zinc knuckle (CCHC-type) family protein and basic helix-loop-helix DNA-binding superfamily protein, having essential roles in gene regulation. Some of the targets, such as laccase (LAC) and heat shock 70 kDa protein (Hsp70) etc., may be related to CMS or pollen development. Unfortunately, the target genes of most identified miRNAs could not be detected in the present degradome analysis. In addition, some target genes have unknown functions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S9).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Target plots (<italic>t-plots</italic>) of identified miRNA targets in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>.

        <p>All of the identified miRNA targets were analyzed by gene ontology (GO, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org/">http://www.geneontology.org/</ext-link>) to assess the targets’ putative functions and uncover the roles of miRNAs in regulating pollen development. As shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S7, the targets were classified into 19 categories in biological processes, followed by 10 and eight categories in cellular components and molecular functions, respectively. Greater percentages of these targets were considered to be involved in metabolic (33.76 %), cellular (32.01 %), single-organism (14.02 %), response to stimulus (12.38 %) and developmental (8.64 %) processes. Among cellular component categories, cell (32.36 %) and cell part (32.36 %) were the main functional groups. For molecular function, the binding (34.58 %) and catalytic activity (24.42 %) terms contained the largest numbers of targets. The results may indicate the importance of these miRNAs in gene regulation during pollen development in soybean.</p>

        <p>To test if any inverse relationship between target expression and the level of corresponding miRNA existed, the expression patterns, based on qRT-PCR, of 14 miRNA targets discussed below were studied. As expected, the expression levels of squamosa promoter-binding protein-like, GAMYB, APETALA2, LACs were higher in NJCMS1A than in NJCMS1B, and those of the other 10 targets such as MADS-box protein etc. were lower in NJCMS1A than in NJCMS1B, which were in contrast with their corresponding miRNAs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S8).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Expression levels of some miRNAs and their target in discussion between NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B.

        <title>Diverse miRNAs and their characteristics in flower buds of NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B</title>
        <p>Small RNAs have been identified as pivotal regulators during anther and pollen development in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, no existing studies have reported the relationship between miRNAs and pollen in soybean. To identify miRNAs linked to the regulation of pollen development in soybean, two small RNA libraries were constructed with the flower buds of a CMS line NJCMS1A and its maintainer NJCMS1B. Based on high-throughput sequencing, we identified a much wider range of small RNAs, 18–30 nt in length (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), with 24 nt being the most abundant, followed by 21 and then 22 nt. The results were consistent with previous reports in various other species, including <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], <italic>Citrus sativus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and <italic>Zea mays</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], suggesting that the most abundant small RNA length is 24 nt. Most known miRNAs had the canonical 21 nt length (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1), suggesting they were Dicer-like1 cleavage products.</p>
        <p>The identification of miRNAs has previously been reported in male-sterile plants, including maize, rice, <italic>Brassica campestris</italic> ssp<italic>. chinensis</italic>, <italic>Brassica juncea</italic> and cotton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The present study is the first to report the comprehensive identification of miRNAs and their targets using deep sequencing of flower buds between CMS and maintainer lines in soybean. Among the 560 known miRNAs, 205 had additional nucleotides in the 5′ or 3′ terminus, which was caused by an imprecise or alternative cleavage by Dicer during pre-miRNA processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. According to miRBase release 21.0, 135 mature miRNAs (31.62 %, 427 mature sequences in total) were annotated as high confidence in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, and all of those miRNAs were reported to have their miRNA-5p or miRNA-3p pairing accumulated. However, until now, no miRNAs were annotated as high confidence in soybean. Thus, the identification of novel miRNAs on the other arm of known pre-miRNAs increased the confidence of these miRNAs. With the criteria described by Kozomara et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and miRBase 21.0, 156 known miRNAs and four novel miRNAs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S7) could be annotated as high-confidence miRNAs.</p>
        <p>Considering that some miRNAs are widespread, while others are distributed in limited plant species, all of the known miRNAs have been classified into four categories: “highly conserved”, “moderately conserved”, “lowly conserved” and “non-conserved”. In our study, a high proportion of non-conserved miRNA families (80.63 %) were identified, and only 27 highly conserved miRNA families were identified (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). Meanwhile, 158 novel miRNAs, which had not been reported in soybean before, were detected. Novel miRNAs are considered to be young miRNAs that evolved recently, and are expressed weakly. They are likely to be species-specific miRNAs, which are classified as non-conserved miRNAs, as reported from other plants, such as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Unlike conserved miRNAs, only a small percent of soybean novel miRNAs (37.74 %) were encoded by multiple loci, which was in accordance with the previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
        <p>Previous studies have demonstrated that many miRNAs exist in male-sterile plants. Shen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] isolated seven novel miRNA families and one known miRNA from a mixture of anthers from a maize CMS line and its maintainer. In 2013, 100 known miRNAs and 81 novel miRNAs of pollen miRNAs from a maize S type CMS line and its fertility-restored line were identified by Yu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], with nine of the known miRNAs having significant expression differences between the two lines. In the same year, Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] identified 197 known and 78 new candidate miRNAs during the reproductive development of <italic>Brassica juncea</italic>, and discovered 47 differentially expressed miRNAs between the CMS and its maintainer. Based on high-throughput sequencing, Wei et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] compared the expression patterns of miRNAs during cotton anther development between the genetic male-sterile mutant and its wild type. A total of 16 conserved miRNA families were identified; six of them were significantly differentially expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Recently, Jiang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] constructed two small RNA libraries from the flower buds of male-sterile and male fertile lines in <italic>Brassica campestris</italic> ssp. <italic>chinensis</italic>, and 18 differentially expressed miRNAs with more than two-fold relative changes were identified. In our study, 560 known miRNAs, 105 novel miRNA-3p/miRNA-5p of known pre-miRNAs, 23 new miRNA members and 159 novel miRNAs (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) in the soybean flower buds of the NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B were identified. We speculate that these miRNAs may participate in the complex network regulating the pollen development process of soybean.</p>

        <title>Degradome analysis of the interactions of miRNAs and their targets</title>
        <p>miRNAs regulate genes by mediating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in plants mainly through mRNA cleavage at certain sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Currently, bioinformatics-based calculations are commonly used to predict miRNA targets. In recent years, modified 5′ RACE has been frequently used to demonstrate miRNA targets in pollen development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The confirmation procedures were convincing but not effective in identifying a number of candidate targets. Fortunately, a high-throughput method combining 5′ RACE with next-generation sequencing technology was developed, which has become the new method for identifying targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p>
        <p>With our degradome analysis, 859 targets were chosen and predicted to be cleaved by 297 miRNAs (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S9). Among the identified targets of miRNAs, some were previously shown to be involved in floral organ or anther development, such as squamosa promoter-binding protein-like [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], APETALA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], GAMYB or GAMYB-like genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], GRAS gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and auxin response factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The expression levels of squamosa promoter-binding protein-like, APETALA2, GAMYB or GAMYB-like genes and their miRNAs were compared by qRT-PCR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), which showed the inverse relationship between target gene expression and the level of corresponding miRNA. A set of PPR proteins are targeted by gma-miR156, gma-miR160, gma-miR319a-5p, gma-miR4413, gma-miR5674, gma-miR5770 and N-gma-miR164r-3p, which are a group of RNA-binding proteins classified as one of the most important restorer gene families in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The transcription of PPR proteins is likely to be inhibited in pollen, so we speculated that these types of miRNAs have correlations with restorer genes that lead to fertility restoration. Some of the targets have not been shown to be associated with pollen development as miRNA targets, such as homeobox-leucine zipper protein and no apical meristem protein. Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] indicated that several models, such as the MADS-box transcription factor in the retrograde regulation model, programmed cell death (PCD) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the aberrant PCD model, and ATP and NADH in the energy deficiency model etc. involved mechanisms that may lead to male sterility in plants.</p>

        <title>Targets of miRNAs with retrograde regulation and PCD</title>
        <p>Three targets of gma-miR156b and gma-miR156f are members of the MADS-box transcription factor family, which participate in reproductive developmental control and flower development in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. MADS-box genes are differentially expressed during early germination of the male gametophyte in <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and are distinct in the male organ primordia of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In maize, their products accumulate in apoptotic bodies during anther dehiscence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Also, MADS-box genes may be in accord with CMS, because in carrot, mitochondria affect the expression of MADS-box genes homologous to GLOBOSA and DEFICIENS, which led to stamens being replaced by carpels, becoming the “carpeloid” CMS type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] found that MADS-box genes were associated with cytoplasmic homeosis in CMS stem mustards, by specifically inhibiting the mitochondrial electron transport chain of <italic>Brassica juncea</italic>. Recently, Huang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] found a MADS-box transcription factor in soybean using a microarray analysis, and its constitutive expression in tobacco caused sterility because of shortened and curly stalks, and the failure of pollen release from the anthers. However, it was only targeted by gma-miR156b and gma-miR156f in NJCMS1A and was down-regulated (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S8). Even so, we speculated it was highly expressed during the pollen development stage, which would lead to pollen abortion. We may be able to control the expression of gma-miR156b and gma-miR156f to regulate male sterility, therefore the relationship between gma-miR156b and gma-miR156f, and male sterility of the soybean CMS line, needs further research.</p>
        <p>The degradome analysis showed that LAC was targeted by gma-miR397a and gma-miR397b-5p. Interestingly, LAC was only targeted by gma-miR397 in NJCMS1B, and the LAC expression level was higher in NJCMS1A than in NJCMS1B (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), which may have been caused by the lower expression of gma-miR397 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S8-2) and the negative regulation of LAC expression in NJCMS1A. Some studies have indicated that LAC participates in brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and that overexpressed OsLAC could lead to a semi-sterile phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Brassinosteroids are essential for male fertility in plants, and mutations in brassinosteroid biosynthesis lead to reduced pollen levels, viability, and release efficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Thus, we speculated that gma-miR397 and LAC have some relationship with CMS. However, qRT-PCR showed that gma-miR397 was more highly expressed in NJCMS1A (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which was inconsistent with the sequencing results and probably related to the anther’s developmental period. In maize, miR397 was more highly expressed in the tetrad stage and then rapidly declined in the mononuclear stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Thus, the relationship of miR397 and LAC with CMS requires further studies.</p>
        <p>Novel_mir_006-3p was a novel miRNA found to target the mitochondrial heat shock 70 kDa protein (mtHsp70), which influences heat- and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced PCD in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Plant PCD, triggered by the retrograde signals from the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol and the overproduction of ROS, controls cellular degeneration of the tapetum and leads to male sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. mtHsp70 functions as a motor and is required for polypeptide translocation across the mitochondrial inner membrane subsequent to protein folding reactions in the matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. In animals, Hsp70-2 participates in synaptonemal complex functions during meiosis in male germ cells and results in male infertility in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. The results of Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] indicate that Hsp70 has a close relationship with the CMS of sorghum. A lack of Hsp70 expression leads to functional anomalies and decreases the numbers of mitochondria, which can eventually lead to pollen sterility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The novel_mir_006-3p was only found in CMS, and mtHsp70 was down-regulated in NJCMS1A (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). However, whether opposed expression levels of novel_mir_006-3p and its target gene in the CMS anthers leads to a significant increase in PCD remains to be studied. In addition, a heat shock cognate 70 kDa protein-like gene that was only targeted by gma-miR393a showed a down-regulated expression level in NJCMS1A (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S8), which may also be related to male sterility.</p>

        <title>Targets of miRNAs involved in responses to oxyradical stress</title>
        <p>NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP-ICDH) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were targeted by gma-miR162a, gma-miR162b and gma-miR162c, and gma-miR399d, gma-miR399e, gma-miR399f and gma-miR399g, respectively. Both are NADPH-generating dehydrogenases in plants, and NADPH is a key cofactor in the cellular redox homeostasis and necessary in the metabolism of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, NADP-ICDH activity is regulated by molecules involved in ROS, including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. These two types of miRNAs had no significant differences in expression levels between the NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B. Surprisingly, they were only targeted in NJCMS1A and the qRT-PCR results show that NADP-ICDH and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were down-regulated (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S8). The decreased NADPH level regulated by miRNA in the NJCMS1A may lead to a transient oxidative burst and significant ROS accumulation. However, more studies are needed to understand the relationship between miRNA targeting and ROS that may lead to male sterility in soybean.</p>
        <p>Alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (adh1) was the only target of gma-miR2119 which encoding an important enzyme during the conversion of acetaldehyde into ethanol, and regenerating NAD<sup>+</sup> in the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In higher plants, the adh gene expression increases dramatically in response to hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Garabagi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] showed that the adh1 expressed in the plants appears to be restricted to immature pollen grains. Hajós-Novák et al.’s results revealed that reduced ADH enzyme activity in the pollen grains would affect the gametophyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Both sequencing and qRT-PCR indicated that gma-miR2119 expression was up-regulated in NJCMS1A. In contrast, adh1 expression was down-regulated in NJCMS1A (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This may indicate that gma-miR2119 and adh1 are related to pollen development, and thus further research is needed.</p>

        <title>Targets of miRNAs in energy metabolism</title>
        <p>NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 24 kDa subunit was identified as the target of gma-miR156b and gma-miR156f, and has a regulatory role in the complex I function in the electron transport chain, which transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone through the intramolecular redox centers (FMN and Fe-S centers) in mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) is an important part of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, and it was the target of gma-miR169t. Selinski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] demonstrated that the ATP/NAD(P)H ratio (by malate valves and NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis) contributes to satisfying the energy demand during pollen development. In this process, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is the critical pathway that supports energy generation for pollen and pollen tube growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p>
        <p>The mitochondrial-like ATP synthase subunit beta was targeted by gma-miR1521a. It is one part of the F-ATPases (F1F0-ATPases), which are located in mitochondrial plasma membranes and are the prime producers of ATP, using the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. One of the targets of gma-miR172c, gma-miR172d and gma-miR172e was the mitochondrial transcription termination factor family protein (mTERFs; homolog of AT4G09620). It was predominantly encoded by the nuclear genome and imported into mitochondria after protein synthesis to play important roles in regulating the organellar transcription machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, mutated mTERF15 led to defective mitochondrial functioning and significantly disturbed normal plant vegetative to reproductive growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. These represent core parts of ATPases or mitochondria that produce ATP for pollen development and miRNA biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These types of genes were only targeted by miRNA (or the target site matched the filter <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in NJCMS1A, indicating that there is a close connection between ATP and CMS. qRT-PCR showed that these targets were down-regulated in NJCMS1A (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S8). However, whether an insufficient supply of ATP may lead to male sterility still needs to be researched. The identification of miRNAs and their targets indicates that there are relationships between miRNAs and pollen development. In addition, some miRNA interactions and target gene expressions may only function during a certain period. Thus, in the future we will research the expression of some important miRNAs and their genes in a specific time period to understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to male sterility in the CMS line of soybean.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In this study, a large number of miRNAs were identified during pollen development in the soybean CMS line NJCMS1A and its maintainer NJCMS1B, by deep sequencing, including 105 novel miRNAs on the other arm of known pre-miRNAs, 23 new miRNA members of known miRNAs, 158 novel miRNAs and 160 high-confidence miRNAs. Additionally, a degradome analysis was used to identify the targets of the discovered miRNAs. Through the expression of miRNAs associated with their targets, we found that there were interactions between miRNAs and their targets. These results revealed that the miRNAs might participate in flower and pollen development, which would provide valuable clues for exploring miRNA-mediated regulatory networks in soybean CMS lines.</p>

        <title>Plant materials, sample collection and total RNA extraction</title>
        <p>The soybean cytoplasmic male-sterile line NJCMS1A was developed through consecutive backcross procedures with the cultivar N8855 as donor parent and N2899 (designated as NJCMS1B afterwards) as recurrent parent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B were planted in the summer of 2013 at Jiangpu Experimental Station, National Center for Soybean Improvement, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. The male-sterile plants were identified through three kinds of methods including the dehiscence of anthers, germination rate of pollens, and performance of plants at maturity. Cytological observation showed that the male abortion of NJCMS1A occurred mainly at the early binucleate pollen stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Because it is very difficult to judge the precise development stage of pollen from the appearance of the flower buds in soybean, so during the flowering period, the flower buds of different sizes up to and including the abortion stage were collected and mixed from NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B plants respectively,, then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for further use. Total RNA from the flower buds of NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B was extracted using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>

        <title>Small RNA sequencing library construction</title>
        <p>Two small RNA libraries were constructed and sequenced by the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China) using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 System (TruSeq SBS KIT-HS V3, Illumina, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The general process is as follows: first, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) purification of the RNA bands corresponding to 18–30-nt size fractionation was performed to recover small RNAs; second, ligation of the 5p and 3p adapters to the RNA occurred in two steps, each followed by PAGE purification; third, RT-PCR amplification was performed to generate a cDNA colony template library and then purified by PAGE; and fourth, the template was analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit) and qPCR was performed to produce a qualified library for sequencing.</p>

        <title>Bioinformatics analysis of miRNA identification</title>
        <p>After sequencing, raw sequencing reads were processed into clean reads by filtering out adaptor contaminants, oversized insertions, low-quality reads, poly A tags and small tags &lt; 18 nt. The small RNA tags were mapped to the soybean genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/compgen">ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/compgen</ext-link> /phytozome/v9.0/Gmax/assembly/Gmax_189.fa.gz) using SOAP to analyze their expression and distribution on the genome. All small RNA sequences were used to query the RNA sequences for deposited repeats (RepeatMasker output) in GenBank (NCBI GenBank). Rfam (V 11.0) was used to separate the small RNAs that matched rRNA, scRNA, snoRNA, snRNA, tRNA and remove the degraded mRNA fragments (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/compgen/phytozome/v9.0/Gmax/annotation/Gmax_189_gene.gff3.gz">ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/compgen/phytozome/v9.0/Gmax/annotation/Gmax_189_gene.gff3.gz</ext-link>) in the small RNA tags that aligned to exons and introns. Next, to identify conserved miRNAs, clean reads were compared with known miRNAs of soybean deposited at miRBase 21.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mirbase.org/">http://www.mirbase.org/</ext-link>). Finally, the other sequences that did not map to known miRNAs and other kinds of small RNA were referred to as unannotated sequences for new miRNA member identification and novel miRNA prediction.</p>
        <p>We identified potentially novel miRNAs using MIREAP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://source-forge.net/projects/">https://source-forge.net/projects/</ext-link> mireap/), and the secondary structure was predicted by the mfold Web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/RNA-Folding-Form">http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/RNA-Folding-Form</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. For novel miRNAs, the number of mature miRNAs with predicted hairpins must be no fewer than five in the alignment results (if the miRNA-3p and miRNA-5p are simultaneously on the two arms of pre-miRNA secondary structures, then one of the mature miRNAs must be no fewer than five). The criteria used for selecting miRNAs must meet the following characteristics based on Meyers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], and Kozomara et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]: (1) The candidate miRNA-5p and miRNA-3p are derived from opposite stem-arms with minimal matched nucleotide pairs exceeding 16 nt and with maximal size differences up to 4 nt; (2) The most abundant reads from each arm of the precursor must pair in the mature miRNA duplex with a 2-nt, 3′ overhang; (3) The number of asymmetric bulges within the miRNA-5p/miRNA-3p duplex must be fewer than one, and the size of the asymmetric bulges must be fewer than two bases; (4) The candidate miRNA precursor must have high negative MFE and MFEI, with MFE &lt; −0.2 kcal/mol/nt and MFEI &gt; 0.85. Then, the sequence is most likely a miRNA.</p>
        <p>The frequency of miRNAs in the two libraries was normalized to the expression of transcript per million (TPM; normalized expression = Actual miRNA count × 1 000 000/Total clean read counts). Following normalization, if one of the miRNA gene expressions between the two samples was zero, then it was revised to 0.01, and if the miRNA gene expression of two samples was less than 1, owing to their too low expression levels, then they were not included in the differential expression analysis. The differential expressions of miRNAs were calculated using fold changes and <italic>P</italic>-values from the normalized expression with the selection threshold of |Log<sub>2</sub>FC (Fold Change)| ≥ | ± 1| and <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, respectively.</p>

        <title>Degradome library construction, data analysis and target identification</title>
        <p>Two degradome libraries were constructed according to the methods by Addo-Quage et al. and German et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. In brief, poly-A-containing mRNA was purified from total RNA, and then a 5′ RNA adaptor containing a <italic>Mme</italic>I recognition site was ligated to the 5′-phosphate of the poly-A RNA. Subsequently, reverse transcription was performed to generate first-strand cDNA, followed by digestion with <italic>Mme</italic>I and ligation to a 3′ adaptor. Finally, the ligation products were amplified using PCR, gel-purified and subjected to deep sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 (TruSeq SBS KIT-HS V3, Illumina; BGI, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China).</p>
        <p>Data filtering was performed to remove adaptor sequences and/or low-quality reads present in the raw reads, resulting in clean reads. This was followed by the collection of 20–21-nt sequences of high quality for subsequent analysis. The degradome tags were mapped to the soybean genome using SOAP and then annotated with rRNA, scRNA, snoRNA, snRNA and tRNA from Rfam and GenBank to separate matched tags from unannotated tags. Degraded sequences with over 70 % single bases in the clean reads were identified as poly-N, which were not used to predict subsequent degradation sites. The statistics of cleaved sites and T-plots were processed by CleaveLand 3.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://axtell-lab-psu.weebly.com/cleaveland.html">http://axtell-lab-psu.weebly.com/cleaveland.html</ext-link>), and PAREsnip (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://srna-workbench.cmp.uea.ac.uk/tools/paresnip/">http://srna-workbench.cmp.uea.ac.uk/tools/paresnip/</ext-link>) was used for the prediction of miRNA targets and hypothesis testing.</p>
        <p>The tags mapped to cDNA_sense were used to predict cleavage sites. Categorization of degradome peaks was performed as follows: The height of the degradome peak at each occupied transcript position was placed into one of five possible categories, described below. Category 0: &gt; 1 raw read at the position, abundance at the position is equal to the maximum on the transcript, and there is only one maximum on the transcript; Category 1: &gt; 1 raw read at the position, abundance at the position is equal to the maximum on the transcript, and there is more than one maximum position on the transcript; Category 2: &gt; 1 raw read at the position, abundance at the position is less than maximum but higher than the median for the transcript; Category 3: &gt; 1 raw read at the position, abundance at the position is equal to or less than the median for the transcript; and Category 4: only 1 raw read at the position.</p>
        <p>Alignments with scores up to 4.5, where G:U pairs scored 0.5, and no mismatches were found at the site between the 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> nucleotides of the corresponding miRNAs, were considered potential targets.</p>

        <title>Quantitative real-time PCR validation</title>
        <p>Stem-loop qRT-PCR and qRT-PCR were carried out to validate differential expressional levels of miRNAs and miRNA targets, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. All primers (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S11) were designed based on the mature miRNA and mRNA sequences, and synthesized commercially (Invitrogen, Shanghai, China). According to the procedures provided by the iScript Select cDNA Synthesis Kit (containing GSP enhancer solution, BIO-RAD, USA), 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed by iScript reverse transcriptase using stem-loop primers. A qRT-PCR analysis was carried out using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (BIO-RAD, USA) on the Bio-Rad CFX96 machine (CFX96 Touch, BIO-RAD, USA). All reactions were run with three biological replicates, and gma-miR1520d was used as the internal control gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. The miRNA relative expression levels were quantified using the 2<sup>–ΔΔCt</sup> method. Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was performed to compare mRNA differences in expression between NJCMS1A and NJCMS1B. The means of 2<sup>–ΔΔCt</sup> were considered significantly different at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>The expression of lactase which digests lactose from milk in humans is generally lost after weaning, but selected mutations influencing the promoter of the lactase gene have spread into the human populations. This is considered a classical example of gene-culture co-evolution, and several studies suggested that the lactase gene has been under strong directional evolutionary selective pressure in the past 5000 to 10,000 years.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>In the present study we investigated the distribution of three gene variants leading to lactase persistence in 12 different East African populations as well as one European population. Our results show that with the exception of Copts and Nilotic populations who are fully lactose non-persistent, the majority of populations of East Africa show at least partly lactose persistence, with both ethnic and socio-economic aspects playing an important role in the distribution of genetic variants. In this study, the variants C/G-13907 and T/G-13915, which are the major variants among the nomadic Arabs in the Arabia and Beja of East Africa, showed remarkable frequencies in Sudanese populations, especially those of pastoralists, in line with the historical links and bidirectional migration of nomadic populations between Arabia and East Africa. The C/T-13910 variant, generally associated with European populations is uniquely present among the Fulani.</p>

          <p>These data indicate that a combination of socio-economic, ethnic and evolutionary factors converged to shape the genetic structure of lactase persistence in East African populations.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>The milk sugar lactose requires hydrolysis in the intestinal tract into the monosaccharides glucose and galactose in order to facilitate their absorption by the enterocytes. The breakdown of lactose in the small intestine is catalyzed by the enzyme lactase, a glycoside hydrolase, which is encoded in humans by the <italic>LCT</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Lactase persistence represents the continued ability to break down lactose in adults, and is a dominant Mendelian polymorphic trait identifiable through its phenotypic effect lactose tolerance. Globally, the percentage of lactase persistence haplotype is approximately 35 %, with the highest frequency being found among European and Americans of European origin and its lowest frequencies present in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
      <p>The ability of adult humans to digest lactose sugar and the nutritional benefit conferred by this trait (by using milk as an additional energy source) is considered as a classical example of gene-culture co-evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Many studies suggested that the <italic>LCT</italic> gene has been under strong directional evolutionary selective pressure resulting from shared cultural traits, animal domestication and adult milk consumption within the past 5000–10,000 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The phenotype of lactase persistence is due to the presence of a haplotype extending more than 2 M nucleotide base pairs on chromosome 2. To date, five major variants (C/T-13910, C/G-13907, T/G-13915, T/G-14009 and G/C-14010) that originated on different haplotype backgrounds in intron 13 of the <italic>MCM6</italic> gene are known to regulate the <italic>LCT</italic> enhancer and are associated with lactase persistence in humans: the C/T-13910 SNP found mainly in Europeans, and C/G-13907, T/G-13915 and G/C-14010 SNPs found in African and Middle Eastern populations, while T/G-14009 is found in Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The association of these genotypes with the phenotype of lactose tolerance has recently been confirmed for African populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>The link between domestication of cattle and the inhabitants of the Nile Valley has a long history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Archeological excavations revealed that people of Neolithic and Kerma who lived in the present day northern Sudan and southern Egypt some 5000 years ago raised livestock from which around 80 % were cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Moreover, historical and archeological findings show evidence of milk fermentation by the later communities as well. Interestingly, drawings attributed to people of the ancient Kingdom of Meroe (690 BC to AD 323) are dominated by cattle. Also the classical Greek writer Strabo (7 BC) mentioned that the Meroites, which are called Ethiopians by classical writers, used fermented milk in their foods. This information indicates that cattle were the major livestock of ancient kingdoms of the Nile Valley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Today, consumption of fresh and fermented milk is widespread in East African populations, including pastoral and agriculturalist communities in the Sudan, South Sudan and Ethiopia. Milk and its products play an important role in the traditional diet of the people, and serve as a major source of cash income for most families. Cattle are the primary source of milk in the region, although nomadic populations also raise sheep, goats and camels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
      <p>The aim of the present study was to assess the presence of three <italic>MCM6</italic> variants modulating <italic>LCT</italic>. Variation in these SNPs lead to the tolerance to lactose in different populations from East Africa living along the Nile Valley in the current territory of the Sudan, South Sudan and Ethiopia. We correlated this information with the occupational characteristics of each of the populations, as well as with ethnic and historical aspects, to increase our understanding of population history in this ancient space of human civilizations.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>To investigate the genetic diversity of lactase persistence alleles among East African populations, a total of 488 saliva samples of unrelated individuals from 12 different East-African ethnic groups from the Sudan, South Sudan and Ethiopia were collected from different geographical area in the Sudan prior to separation.</p>
      <p>The samples used in the present study were collected and studied with ethical approval and informed consent (ref. SUM/2010/7). All protocols were approved by the IRB of the Sudan Medical and Scientific Research Institute (SUMASRI) at the University of Medical Sciences and Technology in Khartoum, and were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.</p>
      <p>Appropriate informed consent and questionnaires were obtained from all participants before sample collection; and samples were grouped according to their self-declared ethnic background of parents and grandparents, and languages. Sample sizes, geographic origin, and linguistic affiliation for each population are reported in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Saliva samples were collected using OrageneTM collection kits (DNA Genotek, Ontario, Canada).

      <p>All samples were genotyped for three SNPs in the MCM6 gene, which have previously been shown to regulate transcriptional activity of the LCT promoter and therefore confer tolerance to lactose (C/G-13907 (rs41525747), C/T-13910 (rs4988235) and T/G-13915 (rs41380347)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. SNPs were genotyped using Sanger sequencing, and for C/T-13910 we additionally performed TaqMan genotyping to confirm the Sanger sequencing results. In order to compare the African samples with samples from European origin, we genotyped the MCM6 SNPs in DNA isolated from blood samples collected from 46 healthy Dutch volunteers. Isolation was performed using the Gentra Pure Gene Blood kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Data analysis was performed using Arlequin v.3 and Genetic Data Analysis v.1.0 programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

      <p>The genotype and haplotype frequencies of the SNPs conferring lactase persistence among the selected populations are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> as well as Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1. The variants T/G-13915, C/G-13907 and C/T-13910 are found among East African populations with frequencies of 15.5, 5.5 and 4 % respectively. The C/T-13910 allele, which is the most common in European populations, was identified in high frequency among Dutch (80 %), Fulani (46 %) and Shokrya (2.5 %). The variants C/G-13907 and T/G-13915, which were found previously in Arabia and among Beja of East Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. were found in high frequencies among Beja, Arabs, Nubians and Ethiopians.

      <p>The SNPs in the various populations were tested for Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium and pairwise disequilibrium using the three variants C/G-13907, C/T-13910 and T/G-13915. The Copts and Nilotes were excluded from the analysis due to the absence of any variants among the genotyped population.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present study variable frequencies in the distribution of <italic>MCM6</italic> genetic variants that influence expression of <italic>LCT</italic> gene were identified in selected East African ethnic groups living in the present territory of the Sudan, South Sudan and Ethiopia (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Shokrya, Fulani and Beja-Bani Amir of the Sudan show the highest genetic diversity of LP haplotypes. These three groups are pastoralist, and milk consumption is an important part of their diet. We can thus assume that genotyping data support the hypothesis of a significant selective advantage of lactose absorption. Interestingly, the European haplotype C/T-13910 is uniquely present in considerable frequencies among the Fulani; which may suggest the possible gene flow between Fulani and European populations, or a relatively recent back migration of this group to Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Remarkably, a notable frequency of the “T” allele was shown in the Arab nomadic group Shokrya, which may be a sign of gene flow from Fulani into this group as a result of their wide distribution in the West and East of the Sudan, which is part of Africa’s Sahel.</p>
      <p>Both Nilotes and Copts show the absence of lactase persistence alleles. Nilotes are inhabited in the South Sudan and are agro-pastoralists who dwell in the savannas region. Nilotes as well as Nuba breed cattle, but animals are kept not so much for the production of meat and milk, but rather as symbols of wealth and social standing (cows are used for paying marriage dowry) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
      <p>Nilotes are of unusually large stature, and live in the savannas of the Upper Nile region. They comprise Dinka, Nuer, Shilluk, Anyuak, Baria and a number of small ethnic groups. Nilotes speak languages within the Nilo-Saharan family. Farming and hunting are the major nutritional sources in Dinka and Nuer, populations that breed cattle and lead a semi-nomadic life, while Shilluk, Baria and Anyuak are agriculturalists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
      <p>The Copts (ancient Egyptians) descend from longstanding cultures of city-states and empires along the Nile, the socio-activities of this group being farming and trade. These different socio-cultural aspects of Copts, Nilotes and Nuba, most likely combined with the serendipitous lack of arising of novel <italic>LCT</italic> mutations, explain the absence/low frequencies of LP alleles among these ancient sedentary populations of the Nile Valley.</p>
      <p>The other residential groups of the Nile (Shwaiga, Gaalien, Mahas and Halfawien) are agriculturists. Despite the fact that their economy is mainly agricultural, they exhibit moderate allele frequencies of LP. This is intriguing in the sense that one would expect sedentary populations to be more able to admix and receive genes from their nomadic counterparts, as the area surrounding the Nile is economically attractive. This assumption is supported by the negative values of the fixation indices of these groups, which may indicate the increase of heterozygosity. Arabs, Nubians and Beja of the Sudan, and Ethiopians show high frequencies of the allele T/G-13915, which is the major LP variant among the nomadic Arabs in Arabian Peninsula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This supports the historical link and bidirectional migration of nomadic populations between Arabia and East Africa. And the significant frequencies of this allele of the nomadic Arabs among Nubians of the Sudan may be due to the gene flow form Afro-Asiatic into this Nilo-Saharan group. Nubians reside at the entering port of the Sudan along the Nile at the border with Egypt, where they were influenced by Arabs as a direct result of the penetration of large numbers of Arabs from Arabia and Egypt into the Sudan over a long period of time following the arrival of Islam around 651 AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
      <p>Ethiopians genotyped in this study consist of three major groups, Oromo, Amhara and Tigray, they practice farming and animal breeding. Ethiopians display a genetic similarity with Beja of the Sudan; both of them have significant frequencies of lactase persistence haplotypes.</p>
      <p>Darfurians is a collective term for a number of residential agriculturalist groups living in arid areas in west of the Sudan (Darfur). Most of the groups in the area practice seasonal cultivation of crops during rainy seasons. They do not rely on fresh milk which is likely the reason why they have low proportion of lactase persistence alleles.</p>
      <p>Fresh milk is commonly used in pastoralist communities, and although agriculturalists of the Sudan, South Sudan and Ethiopia show lower frequencies of lactase persistence compared to pastoralists, the milk products are widely consumed by all socio-economic classes of East African agriculturalists. Both pastoralists and non-pastoralists exhibit different cultures of fermented milk products, including <italic>Rob</italic> (sour yogurt) in the Sudan and South Sudan, white cheese, <italic>Mish</italic> and <italic>Gariss</italic> in the Sudan, and <italic>Ergo</italic> in Ethiopia. <italic>Rob</italic> and <italic>Ergo</italic> are naturally fermented cow’s or goat’s milk products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. They are the most common traditional dairy fermented food in many areas in the Sudan and Ethiopia. The bulk of these products are produced by the nomadic and semi-nomadic communities during the rainy seasons when fresh milk is available in abundance. The milk is fermented using traditional procedures to obtain sour milk and butter. The white cheese and <italic>Mish</italic> are known in urban communities, and they were probably introduced into the Sudan from Egypt during the Turkish rule in the 19th Century. The major forms of milk fermentation give a good example of the integration of Arab and African cultures in the Sudan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. <italic>Gariss</italic> is the special fermented milk of Arab camel herders in east and west of the Sudan. The camel herders spend sometimes months sustained on <italic>Gariss</italic> alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Acetic acid bacteria and yeasts are involved in the fermentation of fresh milk. Starter culture of fermented milk contains lactose and phosphorylation enzymes produced by lactic acid bacteria to hydrolyze lactose and to initiate the lactic acid glucose phosphate energy cycles. Lactose is hydrolyzed to the monosaccharides, glucose and galactose. The galactose is converted in the milk to glucose, which may facilitate the absorption of it in the small intestine among the lactose intolerant people with no known symptoms of malabsorption of milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
      <p>In conclusion, in the present study we have investigated the distribution of <italic>LCT</italic> gene variants that are associated with LP in twelve different East African populations. With the exception of Copts and Nilotes who are fully lactose intolerant, the majority of populations of East Africa have lactase persistence at moderate frequency. The genetic cause of lactose tolerance is however variable, with both ethnic and socio-economic aspects playing an important role in the distribution of genetic variants. The allele T/G 13915, the major LP variant among the nomadic Arabs in Arabian Peninsula, shows high frequencies in Sudanese populations, in line with the historical links and bidirectional migration of nomadic populations between Arabia and East Africa.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>These data tally with the previous data of the distribution of lactase persistence in East Africa, although future studies are warranted to investigate the distribution of more LP variants among the populations studied here. In conclusion, our study indicates that a combination of life style/culture with evolutionary pressure played a crucial role in shaping genetic structure of LP in African populations.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>The widespread adoption of high-throughput sequencing technologies by genetic diagnostic laboratories has enabled significant expansion of their testing portfolios. Rare autosomal recessive conditions have been a particular focus of many new services. Here we report a cohort of 26 patients referred for genetic analysis of Joubert (JBTS) and Meckel-Gruber (MKS) syndromes, two clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions that define a phenotypic spectrum, with MKS at the severe end.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Exome sequencing was performed for all cases, using Agilent SureSelect v5 reagents and Illumina paired-end sequencing. For two cases medium-coverage (9×) whole genome sequencing was subsequently undertaken.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Using a standard analysis pipeline for the detection of single nucleotide and small insertion or deletion variants, molecular diagnoses were confirmed in 12 cases (4 %). Seeking to determine whether our cohort harboured pathogenic copy number variants (CNV), in JBTS- or MKS-associated genes, targeted comparative read-depth analysis was performed using FishingCNV. These analyses identified a putative intragenic <italic>AHI1</italic> deletion that included three exons spanning at least 3.4 kb and an intergenic <italic>MPP4</italic> to <italic>TMEM237</italic> deletion that included exons spanning at least 21.5 kb. Whole genome sequencing enabled confirmation of the deletion-containing alleles and precise characterisation of the mutation breakpoints at nucleotide resolution. These data were validated following development of PCR-based assays that could be subsequently used for “cascade” screening and/or prenatal diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Our investigations expand the <italic>AHI1</italic> and <italic>TMEM237</italic> mutation spectrum and highlight the importance of performing CNV screening of disease-associated genes.

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>In recent years the widespread adoption of next-generation sequencing technologies has led to step-wise improvements in the provision of diagnostic testing services. This was initially a result of an improvement in testing efficiency focusing on single-gene assays, but has more recently been due to ‘panel testing’, whereby numerous genes are analysed concurrently in a single assay. A natural progression of this approach is to perform whole exome sequencing and analyse a “virtual” gene panel, comprising a subset of the sequenced loci. Extremely heterogeneous disorders, overlapping a spectrum of clinical phenotypes, are ideally suited to analysis by these new approaches and have enabled diagnostic laboratories to significantly expand their test portfolios.</p>
      <p>We have used virtual exome panels for diagnosis of several heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorders, including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD; OMIM: 244400), one of a number of disorders prevalent in our local community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Patients present with recurrent respiratory infections, male infertility and heterotaxy in approximately 50 % of cases. Although cilia are ubiquitous, PCD is caused by defects specifically in the motile cilia that are required for embryonic gastrulation, for clearance of respiratory tract mucosa, and to propel spermatozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Standing in contrast are a number of ciliopathies caused by mutations in immotile cilia. These disorders present pleiotropic clinical abnormalities, often of the central nervous system, eye and skeleton, as well as cystic kidney disease. They are relatively common Mendelian conditions with an estimated combined prevalence of 1 in 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>Two ciliopathies with overlapping features and considerable underlying genetic heterogeneity are Joubert (JBTS; OMIM: 213300) and Meckel-Gruber (MKS; OMIM: 249000) syndromes, which are currently associated with 31 and 13 genes respectively, ten of which are documented to cause both conditions. JBTS is characterised by neurodevelopmental abnormalities in conjunction with a pathognomonic neuroradiological finding (the molar tooth sign). The latter results from cerebellar vermis hypoplasia or aplasia, elongated superior cerebellar peduncles and a deep interpeduncular fossa. Patients often present with a lack of balance and coordination and a wide spectrum of associated features occur, including postaxial polydactyly, retinal degeneration, cleft lip, seizures, as well as renal and hepatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. While some children die in infancy most survive, with variable developmental outcomes. In contrast, MKS is typically a perinatally lethal syndrome characterised by posterior fossa abnormalities (most frequently occipital encephalocele), bilateral enlarged cystic kidneys, postaxial polydactyly and hepatic ductal plate malformation.</p>
      <p>Given the overlapping genetic etiologies of these conditions, a pragmatic solution to robust molecular diagnostic investigation is to undertake concurrent mutation analysis of all JBTS/MKS reported genes. Although this strategy is broadly applicable to heterogeneous conditions, individual populations exist in which a more targeted approach is likely to be more cost-effective. One such example is the high prevalence of <italic>MKS1</italic> and <italic>CC2D2A</italic> mutations present in the Finnish population, as a result of founder effects caused by their genetic isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Similarly, numerous JBTS patients of French-Canadian origin have been identified with mutations in <italic>TMEM237</italic> or <italic>C5orf42</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Nonetheless, broader routine genetic analysis using NGS gene panels facilitates the establishment of genotype-phenotype correlations in these disorders. The ultimate aim of such analyses is to enable improved variant classification and prognostic assessment. The most compelling reported association is between COACH syndrome (OMIM: 216360), a JBTS-related disorder for which patients have JBTS with liver involvement or coloboma, and mutations in <italic>TMEM67</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In terms of allelic spectrum, missense mutations in <italic>CC2D2A</italic> have been reported to cause JBTS whereas null alleles cause MKS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Such studies are reliant on thorough phenotype data. While this information is often not available to the diagnostic laboratories undertaking the mutation analysis, centralised large-scale resequencing projects are increasingly mandating use of structured phenotype ontologies which will alleviate this problem.</p>
      <p>Here we present our experience of using a standard diagnostic pipeline to perform point mutation and small insertion/deletion variant detection in a series of patients referred with either JBTS or MKS. We undertook whole exome sequencing and analysed a virtual panel of JBTS- and MKS-associated genes. We subsequently used these data to undertake exome-based CNV analysis to identify exon deletion and/or duplication variants that are typically smaller than those that can be resolved using standard array CGH platforms. Positive CNV analysis results were validated using whole genome sequencing (WGS) and split read mapping to identify breakpoint sequences at nucleotide resolution.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>DNA was isolated from blood or fetal tissue of 26 affected individuals using standard salting out or phenol/chloroform extraction protocols. (The developmental age of the individuals ranged from prenatal to 4 years.) All patients were referred to the Yorkshire Regional Genetics Laboratory, Leeds, for diagnostic testing with a clinical diagnosis of either JBTS (9 patients) or MKS (17 patients). The Leeds East Research Ethics Committee granted ethical approval (07/H1306/113) and written informed consent was obtained from the parents or next of kin of all individuals.</p>
      <sec id="Sec3">
        <title>Targeted next-generation sequencing</title>
        <p>Diagnostic mutation analysis of JBTS- and MKS-associated genes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) was performed using exome-enriched sequence data. Genomic DNA (3 μg) was first sheared into 200–300 bp fragments using a Covaris S2 (Covaris, Inc., Woburn, MA, USA). SureSelect XT reagents (Agilent Technologies, Wokingham, UK) were used to perform end-repair, A-addition and adaptor ligation reactions to generate Illumina-compatible sequencing libraries. Hybridisation capture enrichment of whole genome libraries was performed using the SureSelect v5 all-exon probe set, following manufacturer’s recommendations throughout. Equimolar aliquots of 5 post-enrichment libraries were pooled before sequencing using version 3 TruSeq chemistry on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Paired-end 100-bp sequence reads were “demultiplexed” using CASAVA v.1.8.2 and the resulting per-sample FASTQ.gz files were aligned to an indexed reference genome (hg19) using bwa v.0.6.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/">http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Duplicate reads were removed using Picard v.1.85 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://picard.sourceforge.net/">http://picard.sourceforge.net</ext-link>) before indel realignment, base quality score recalibration and variant discovery were performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) v.2.3-4Lite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Identified variants were saved in variant call format (VCF) and then annotated with positional, frequency and functional <italic>in silico</italic> predictions using Alamut Batch standalone v.1.4.0, (database v.2015.04.30) (Interactive Biosoftware, Rouen, France). These programs included SIFT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sift.jcvi.org/">http://sift.jcvi.org</ext-link>), and AlignGVGD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://agvgd.iarc.fr/agvgd_input.php">http://agvgd.iarc.fr/agvgd_input.php</ext-link>). AgileExomeFilter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] was used to interrogate these data and determine the pathogenicity status of each variant in accordance with the Association for Clinical Genetic Science best practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Manual inspection of aligned sequence reads was performed using the Integrative Genome Viewer v.2.3.52 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. To determine assay performance, the number of sequence reads mapping to targeted genomic intervals was calculated for each patient using the GATK DepthOfCoverage walker. Exon-based copy number analysis was performed on coordinate-sorted duplicate-cleaned BAM files using FishingCNV v.2.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The reference control pool for the copy number analyses comprised 65 patients referred for disorders other than JBTS or MKS. Inter-batch variability was reduced using the FishingCNV principal component option (−pca) for all samples analysed.</p>

        <title>Medium coverage whole genome sequencing</title>
        <p>To verify variants identified by FishingCNV, and to validate their intragenic breakpoints, whole genome libraries were generated and sequenced. Approximately 1 μg of DNA was sheared into 200–300-bp fragments using a Covaris S2, and an Illumina-compatible sequencing library generated using NEBNext® Ultra™ reagents (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The insert size was ~250 bp and the final enrichment PCR comprised six rounds of thermocycling. Each patient library was sequenced on a single lane of a HiSeq 2500 rapid mode flow cell, generating 175-bp sequence reads. Raw data was converted to FASTQ.gz format using CASAVA v.1.8.2. Adaptor sequences were trimmed from the ends of the sequence reads using Cutadapt v.1.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cutadapt.readthedocs.org">https://cutadapt.readthedocs.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] before alignment to the human genome (hg19) using bwa v.0.6.2. Reads that remained unmapped to the reference genome were extracted from the duplicate-cleaned coordinate-sorted BAM files and converted to FASTQ format using bam2fastq v.1.1.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gsl.hudsonalpha.org/information/software/bam2fastq">http://gsl.hudsonalpha.org/information/software/bam2fastq</ext-link>). For each patient, split read alignments were performed using SplazerS v.1.1 against a FASTA reference sequence that included the FishingCNV-defined CNV (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.seqan.de/projects/splazers/">http://www.seqan.de/projects/splazers/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Breakpoint-spanning reads were identified following interpretation of the alignment CIGAR string. BLAT was then used to determine the genomic coordinates of the 5′ and 3′ fragments (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat">http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>

A second forward primer (d<underline>TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT</underline>ATGTGTCAGGGATCCTCAGG) together with the common reverse primer yielded a smaller 356-bp PCR product specific for the normal allele. Each PCR consisted of 0.5 μl of genomic DNA (250 ng/μl), 11 μl of MegaMix (Microzone Ltd., Haywards Heath, UK), 1 μl of 10 pmol/μl forward primer and 1 μl of 10 pmol/μl reverse primer. Each primer contained a universal tag (underlined) allowing Sanger sequencing according to our standard laboratory workflow. Thermocycling conditions consisted of 5 min at 94 °C then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 45 s before a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min. To facilitate rapid and robust cascade screening, optimal <italic>AHI1</italic> primer concentrations were determined to allow a three-primer multiplex reaction, with PCR products resolved on a 1.5 % tris-borate-EDTA agarose gel.</p>
        <p>Sanger sequencing was used to confirm all variants included on clinical reports; manufacturer’s protocols were followed throughout (Applied Biosystems, Paisley, UK).

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>We have previously implemented a “targeted exome” diagnostic test for primary ciliary dyskinesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. By using the same lab-bench workflow with a modified informatics pipeline, this test has been expanded to include two additional rare recessive conditions, JBTS and MKS. The 34 currently known JBTS and MKS disease-associated genes were included in our analyses; these comprise more than 700 exons and 33 kb of coding sequence (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Average read count per patient was 92.4 million reads of which ~9.8 % were identified as PCR duplicates (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). This is slightly higher than our typical duplicate rate and may reflect the limited quantity and quality of the available DNA samples. The percentage of reads mapping to exome-located nucleotides (~59 %) is consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and corresponds to ~48 million reads per exome. Approximately 86 % of target nucleotides per sample (coding bases plus 20-bp of flanking intron) were sequenced by at least 30 reads (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3).</p>
      <p>Variant interrogation was restricted to the 34 known disease-associated genes. This reduced the average total variant count from 33,766 to 70 per patient (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). By excluding common variants (minor allele frequency 0.05) the burden of manual interpretation was reduced to approximately eight variants per patient. The disease-associated pathogenicity status of each of these was classified according to the Association for Clinical Genetic Science best practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this way a confirmatory molecular diagnosis was achieved in 12 out of 26 cases (46 %) (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The mutation spectrum was largest for <italic>TMEM67</italic>, which harboured seven different pathogenic mutations in our cohort.

      <p>In patients, the diagnosis of JBTS or MKS could not be confirmed, either (a) because the identified variant(s) was classified as probably benign, or a variant of uncertain significance or (b) because the patient was a carrier of only a single <italic>bona fide</italic> pathogenic mutation (four individuals). We performed exome-based copy number analysis of the JBTS- and MKS-associated disease genes for all patients in the cohort (data not shown). Heterozygous multi-exon deletions were identified in two separate patients. Both of these subjects were also carriers of pathogenic single-nucleotide deletions in the corresponding gene. For patient 1 the deletion reported by FishingCNV spanned at least 3.4 kb and included <italic>AHI1</italic> exons 14–16 [GenBank:NM_001134830.1] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). For patient 16, the detected deletion extended from <italic>TMEM237</italic> exon 1a [GenBank:NM_152388.3] to <italic>MPP4</italic> exon 14 [GenBank:NM_003066.2], spanning at least 21.5 kb and 11 exons. For both variants, the maximal extent of the deleted sequence was defined by the proximity of captured flanking exons; this refined the maximal extent of each deletion to 9.9 kb and 25.5 kb, respectively.</p>
      <p>Retrospective inspection of aligned sequence reads within the putative disease-containing loci did not reveal any homozygous non-reference (or heterozygous) variants to support (or oppose) the existence of the deleted sequences. Inspecting the alignment BAM files in the Integrated Genome Viewer did however reveal a halving of relative read depth at both deletion-containing loci. To validate our findings and delineate the intragenic breakpoints, we performed medium-coverage (9×) WGS using a longer, 175-bp sequencing read. To reduce adaptor read-through, the library insert, size was increased from ~200 bp to ~250 bp. Despite this, ~20 % adaptor-trimmed reads were present in the sequenced dataset (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Unmapped reads were recovered from the alignment BAM file and a split-read mapping algorithm was used to search for reads spanning the deletion breakpoint. For the <italic>AHI</italic> variant, a single such read was identified, indicating a deletion of 5,330 nucleotides, while for the <italic>TMEM237</italic>/<italic>MPP4</italic> variant two reads were identified, suggesting a deletion of 24,074 nucleotides. The number of aligned nucleotides on either side of the breakpoint and their genomic coordinates, identified using BLAT, are listed in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. The positions and orientations of these breakpoint-spanning reads with respect to the human reference sequence and UCSC RepeatMasker track are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>NGS workflows suitable for detecting single nucleotide and small insertion/deletion variants are now well established throughout the genetic diagnostic community. Many assays initially used long-range PCR as the target enrichment method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], but owing to the finite number of long-range PCR primers that can be sustainably handled, enrichment is now more typically performed using hybridisation capture. Furthermore, the robustness and quality assurance provided by a pre-designed “off-the-shelf” reagent, as well as the potential to target much larger genomic regions, has added to the increased popularity of this methodology. For staff undertaking NGS library production, a single laboratory method streamlines the workflow and increases productivity. For analysis, establishing a new diagnostic test can be as straightforward as adjusting the genomic coordinates of the targeted regions. These factors are enabling diagnostic laboratories to maintain pace with the emergence of newly reported gene associations. In our centre, we now routinely undertake targeted diagnostic exome analysis of JBTS- and MKS-associated genes. We were able to confirm diagnoses in 14 of the first 26 cases, a diagnostic yield of 54 %. This may increase in light of new evidence, as it is possible that variants deemed to be of uncertain clinical significance, may be re-classified as pathogenic, disease-causing, mutations. Alternatively, the “missing” disease-causing mutations may be located in genomic regions that were not targeted either for sequencing (e.g. promoters or introns) or analysis (genes yet to be recognised as disease-associated). For example, common biological mechanisms involving ciliary structure and function may imply genetic relatedness between JBTS/MKS and the wider spectrum of “ciliopathies”, in which developmental effects of defective ciliary function are manifested. Our strategy of analysing a full exome, rather than a gene set targeting only OMIM genes (a “clinical exome”) will allow us to re-analyse quickly, as new disease-associated genes continue to be reported. It is likely that this will be driven by multi-centre consortia capable of amassing many hundreds of similarly affected patients as has been recently reported by Bachmann-Gagescu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The diagnostic yield in their study was comparable with our own. Despite this the spectrum of identified pathogenic mutations was more diverse, comprising mutations in 23 of the 27 genes they analysed. The considerable number of cases of South Asian ethnicity (13 patients), for whom consanguineous marriage is customary, may account for the relative homogeneity of pathogenic mutations identified in our cohort. That the <italic>TCTN2</italic> mutation c.1506-2A &gt; G was identified in four individuals, all of whom were South Asian, suggests this variant may be a founder mutation in this population. Seventeen cases (65 %) were referred for testing with a clinical diagnosis of MKS, so it is unsurprising that an MKS locus accounts for the greatest number of different pathogenic variants in our cohort. Given the accelerating rate of new gene discovery, the ability to reanalyse existing datasets is likely to be of particular clinical utility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
      <p>Comparative read-depth analysis enabled the identification of two heterozygous deletion variants in <italic>trans</italic> with pathogenic point mutations. It is worth noting that the use of whole exome sequencing allowed us to better define the maximal extent of the intergenic <italic>TMEM237</italic>/<italic>MPP4</italic> deletion than would have been possible had we used a reagent targeting only known JBTS/MKS genes. (If limited sequencing capacity precludes the use of routine exome sequencing, one alternative approach might be to add capture probes for the exons of genes flanking the targeted genes.) Although multiplex-ligation probe (MLPA) assays are widely regarded as the “gold-standard” technique for detecting exonic deletions and duplications, the production of validated reagents cannot keep pace with ever expanding targeted gene panels. In contrast, our CNV analyses did not require additional laboratory reagents or staff costs.</p>
      <p>While it is conceptually and practically straightforward to identify homozygous deletions, due to the absence of sequence reads at normally well-captured genomic loci, automated identification of heterozygous deletions and duplications is more challenging and the sensitivity of CNV detection remains poorly defined. Limitations probably include reduced sensitivity of detection of CNVs encompassing GC-rich regions. Such regions, which often include a gene’s first exon, are consistently reported to be poorly captured using hybridisation enrichment technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Consequently, custom capture reagent designs, targeting fewer loci than an exome, may overcome problems associated with regions of repeatedly poor sequence coverage by allowing an increase in capture probe density in specific underrepresented regions. An important consideration when performing relative read-depth analyses is the origin of the control dataset, specifically whether it is derived from inter-batch or intra-batch samples. In targeted exome analyses, available sequencer capacity probably limits the ability of most diagnostic laboratories to pool enough samples in one experiment for robust intra-batch normalisation. This approach may therefore be more amenable to the analysis of smaller targeted panels, in which more NGS libraries can be pooled. Regardless of the method used to define the control cohort, knowledge of a disorder’s mutation spectrum is of paramount importance. Including in a reference control pool cases for which there is a high prior probability of a CNV (or including family members) could dilute the effect of a true deviation in relative read-depth.</p>
      <p>The ability to detect CNVs in hybridisation enrichment experiments is influenced by gene size and structure. A deletion of large genomic extent could be missed if exons are sparsely distributed, reducing the number of available data-points. Similar considerations apply when trying to define the boundaries of a putative CNV. Consequently, for genes within which CNVs account for a significant component of the mutation spectrum, it may prove beneficial to include additional capture probes within surrounding introns. Although our investigations have revealed two cases in whom dosage variants account for the pathogenic disease allele, we have identified too few events to ascribe a precise sensitivity and specificity to this workflow. Future efforts in this area are likely to be hindered, in the short-term, by the paucity of identified pathogenic copy-number alleles. As such, without performing whole genome sequencing of the entire cohort, it will not be possible to completely exclude pathogenic dosage mutations in JBTS or MKS disease associated genes in the reported patients.</p>
      <p>We confirmed candidate CNVs using medium coverage (9×) WGS, an increasingly cost-effective solution which enabled nucleotide-resolution breakpoint detection to be delivered in a regional diagnostic laboratory. We used an unsupported 175-bp sequencing protocol, but the recent release of 2 × 250-bp kits should further improve the power of this approach to CNV validation. The length of read available for alignment is especially important when performing split-read alignments, as the breakpoint will not in general be centred within the read. The sequence context surrounding the breakpoint will also have a direct bearing on its ability to be detected. Both breakpoints reported here were located within elements identified by RepeatMasker. Low complexity sequences are difficult to align to a reference sequence using short read technology. Although we were able to implement customised sequencer run configurations, these will not be available to all diagnostic laboratories. For these centres, the identification of discordant read pairs (for which the read mapping positions are at variance with the expected library insert size) may offer an alternative route to validating CNVs.</p>
      <p>Defining CNVs at single-nucleotide resolution permits inexpensive PCR-based genotyping assays to be deployed for testing the extended family, as demonstrated above for case 1.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>The CNVs identified here have not previously been reported in the literature and therefore expand the JBTS mutation spectrum. With ever-improving mutation detection techniques, it is likely that dosage variants will be more frequently identified and characterised at nucleotide resolution. The CNVs we describe are smaller than those typically detected by diagnostic array-CGH or by our standard genome-wide copy number sequencing (CNVseq) approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Although the sensitivity gap between front-line aCGH/CNVseq technologies and the limits of detection using the comparative read-depth approach are ill-defined, they will probably be bridged as the cost of WGS falls in future years. In the interim, our present report, emphasizes the additional diagnostic yield that can be obtained at little cost, using modifications of current analytical approaches.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and chronic mitral valve disease (CMVD) in dogs are associated with heart chamber enlargement, also of the left atrium. DCM is often accompanied by rhythm disturbances (mainly atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias). In CMVD, arrhythmias are observed less frequently. It is still unclear whether left atrial enlargement in these diseases results from volume overload or if it is also connected with other factors (e.g. rhythm disturbances).</p>
          <p>This study was conducted on the left atrial myocardial specimens from 31 dogs, including those from 16 dogs with clinically diagnosed DCM and 15 dogs with CMVD. After fixation and staining (using haematoxylin-eosin and Masson-Goldner trichrome stain), the specimens underwent evaluation. Parenchymal changes (fibrosis, fatty infiltration, and vessel narrowing), degenerative changes (loss of striation, changes in cardiomyocyte structure, and abnormal cell nuclei) and the presence of inflammatory infiltrates were assessed.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>More interstitial fibrosis (median 4 vs. 2.5 grid fields; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and less perivascular fibrosis (median score 1 vs. 2; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) was observed in the DCM group compared to the CMVD group. Moreover, less distinct vessel narrowing was observed in the DCM group than in the CMVD group (median lumen area ratio 0.3 vs. 0.26 respectively; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Dogs with DCM showed more strongly defined degenerative changes than the CMVD dogs (median nuclei enlargement score 3 vs. 1, median loss of striation score 3 vs. 2 and median structural alterations score 3 vs. 2, respectively; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>The obtained results indicate a different nature of changes occurring in the left atrial myocardium of dogs with DCM compared to dogs with mitral valve disease, including differences in vessel narrowing, cardiomyocyte degeneration and in the distribution of connective tissue.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a polyetiological disease characterised by a dilation of heart chambers (mainly the left ventricle and left atrium) without other significant structural heart defects. In some cases, it is combined with myocardial failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is mostly encountered in large and giant breed dogs but it can also develop in dogs of other breeds (e.g. English and American cocker spaniels, poodles and Portuguese water dogs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. During the development of DCM the radiographic, echocardiographic and post-mortem examinations reveal an enlargement of the left ventricle and left atrium or an enlargement of all the heart chambers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The ventricular dilation in DCM alters the geometry of atrioventricular valves, which results in valvular insufficiency. Mitral regurgitation increases left atrial pressure that may worsen the pathological remodelling of the left atrium and the left ventricle and independently stimulate the dilation of the heart chambers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The disease is often accompanied by rhythm disturbances, mainly atrial fibrillation. However, there is no consent whether atrial fibrillation is the cause or result of atrial enlargement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>The histopathologic examination of the samples obtained from dogs with DCM demonstrates changes in the myocardial structure. There are two well-described forms of histopathologic lesions in the ventricular specimens of dogs with DCM: the attenuated wavy fibre type (AWF) and the fatty infiltration-degenerative (FID) type. Those lesions are mostly encountered in specimens from the left ventricle, but can also occur in the myocardium of the right ventricle and interventricular septum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Our previous study showed similar changes in atrial specimens from dogs with FID types of lesions in the ventricles. In dogs with the AWF type of ventricular lesions, the changes observed in atria can resemble either AWF or FID types of changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The attenuation of cardiomyocytes is a specific pathological feature of DCM. However, vacuolisation, extensive fibrosis and fatty infiltration may also occur in the ventricular walls during the course of that disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Due to the fact that there is a similarity between the FID type of DCM and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, it is important to accurately characterise the disease based on the clinical and histopathological examinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>The mechanism of changes occurring in the atrial myocardial structure in DCM is not well defined. It is suspected that the structural protein defects, impaired tissue oxygen supply and other factors may play a role in the development of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is not well understood whether the macroscopic and microscopic changes within the atria in dogs with DCM are a result of primary remodelling, the presence of arrhythmias, or a response of the cardiac tissue to functional disturbances, including volume overload (which also occurs in mitral valve disease).</p>
      <p>Canine chronic mitral valve disease (CMVD) is the most common cardiovascular disease in dogs and the most frequent cause of congestive heart failure in those animals. The disease predominantly occurs in small breed dogs (e.g. Cavalier King Charles spaniels, Yorkshire terriers, dachshunds) and progresses with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The progressive dilation of the left ventricle and the left atrium in CMVD results from degenerative changes and an insufficiency of the mitral valve, leading to symptoms of heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Histopathologic changes within the ventricular walls include fibrosis and arteriosclerosis without or with slight myocyte atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>The purpose of the study was a histopathologic comparison of the left atrial wall specimens obtained from dogs with severe left atrial enlargement resulting from clinically diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or chronic mitral valve disease (CMVD). To the authors’ knowledge, there are no detailed studies comparing histopathologic changes occurring in the atria in those diseases.</p>

        <p>Thirty-one dogs aged from 4 to 19 years (23 males and 8 females) with either CMVD or DCM were included in the study. Dogs met the inclusion criteria if they had an enlarged left atrium according to an echocardiographic examination (left atrial (LA)-to-aortic root (Ao) diameter ratio; LA/Ao &gt;1.7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]), which was confirmed in a post-mortem examination. Dogs were included in the DCM group if they had a dilated left ventricle and a decreased fractional shortening (FS &lt; 20 %) noted during an echocardiographic examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] with normal or type 1 mitral valve lesions (according to Whitney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]). Dogs were included in the CMVD group if they had preserved left ventricular systolic function (FS &gt; 20 %, noted in the echocardiographic examination) with type 3 or 4 mitral valve lesions (according to Whitney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]). At the time of death or euthanasia, all dogs presented with stage D heart failure (according to the ACVIM Consensus Statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]).</p>

        <title>Ante-mortem examination</title>
        <p>All animals underwent a clinical examination, echocardiography and electrocardiography, and were treated and re-examined every 6 months, until they died or were euthanized due to heart failure refractory to treatment. Only the LA/Ao ratio from the last examination of each dog served as an inclusion criterion.</p>
        <p>The ECG was performed in right lateral recumbency using a 6-channel BTL SD08 device (BTL, UK) with I, II, III, aVL, aVR, aVF, and precordial (V1-V6) lead recordings. The echocardiographic examination was performed in standard views using the Aloka SSD 4000 and Aloka Alpha7 machines and included the assessment of the LA/Ao ratio, end-systolic and end-diastolic left ventricular measurements, ejection fractions and FS, blood velocity through the aortic and pulmonic valve, and the function of the atrioventricular valves. The relative left atrial size was estimated based on the LA/Ao. This parameter was determined using standard images acquired from a right short-axis view at the base of the heart. Estimates of left ventricular systolic function were obtained from the index of circumferential myocardial contraction and FS using the formula: FS[%] = ([LVIDd – LVIDs]/LVIDd) ×100, where LVIDd and LVIDs are the internal left ventricular dimensions at end-diastole and end-systole, respectively. Left ventricular dilation was estimated based on the comparison of chamber measurements (internal diameter and wall thickness) to standard breed-specific or body-weight specific values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The function of the atrioventricular, pulmonary and aortic valves was examined using pulsed wave Doppler and color Doppler techniques.</p>

      <sec id="Sec5">
        <title>Post-mortem examination</title>
        <p>The results of the echocardiographic examination (left atrial and left ventricular enlargement) were confirmed during the post-mortem examination, where the type of mitral valve lesion was determined. Heart measurements were taken using a manual 150 mm Beerendonk caliper, measured to the nearest 1/20 mm. The measurements were taken in planes compatible with those used during the echocardiographic examination. Specimens from the left atrial wall were collected from each dog for further histopathologic analysis. They were fixed in 7 % buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin blocks, sectioned at 6 μm, stained using the standard haematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) method and Masson-Goldner trichrome (for a better visualisation of connective tissue), and underwent a light microscopy evaluation. Photomicrographs of each studied specimen were subjected to computer-assisted image analysis, using a computer coupled to an optical Olympus BX53 microscope, equipped with a Color View IIIu digital Olympus camera (Olympus, Japan). A morphometric analysis was performed using Cell^A software (Olympus Soft Imaging Solution GmbH, Germany).</p>
        <p>To accurately describe the histopathological changes in the atria, specimens were evaluated for the presence and severity of fibrosis, fatty infiltration, inflammatory infiltration, intra-myocardial arterial narrowing and degenerative changes in cardiomyocytes. The latter was expressed as the presence of abnormal cell nuclei (swollen nuclei with an altered structure surrounded by a “halo”), loss of striation, and other features of degeneration (e.g. swelling of the cardiomyocyte, blurring of the cell structure and alterations in staining).</p>
        <p>The presence and severity of interstitial fibrosis and fatty infiltration were evaluated after superimposing a 16-field grid over the digital image and counting the number of fields that showed the presence of fatty infiltration or fibrosis (in 200× magnification, after Masson-Goldner trichrome staining), as proposed by Lobo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
        <p>The severity of perivascular fibrosis was assessed using the following scoring system: 0, no fibrosis; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe fibrosis (in 100× magnification, after Mason-Goldner trichrome staining).</p>
        <p>Inflammatory infiltrates were evaluated according to the number of inflammatory cells in a field at a 400× magnification (H&amp;E staining).</p>
        <p>Intra-myocardial arterial narrowing was assessed using the lumen area ratio (LAR; the luminal area of the vessel divided by the total vessel area, not including the adventitia), as proposed by Falk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] (at 200× magnification, after H&amp;E staining).</p>
        <p>Cardiomyocyte degenerative changes (abnormal cell nuclei, loss of striation and changes in cardiomyocyte structure) were assessed using the following scoring system: 0, none or involving &lt;25 % of the myofibres; 1, involving 25–50 % of the myofibres; 2, involving 50–75 % of the myofibres; 3, involving &gt;75 % of the myofibres (at 400× magnification, after H&amp;E staining).</p>
        <p>Each of the features was evaluated in 20 randomly chosen fields per slide (for fatty infiltrates, interstitial fibrosis, inflammatory infiltrates, and cardiomyocyte degenerative changes) or in at least 10 vessels per slide (for perivascular fibrosis and LAR), and a mean score was subsequently calculated for the slide.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>The DCM group consisted of 16 dogs (9 Doberman pinschers, 4 German shepherds, 2 boxers, and 1 great Dane, aged 4–11 years, including 12 males and 4 females). Seven specimens from the left ventricle presented with an AWF type of lesion, while nine specimens had features of a FID type of lesion. The CMVD group comprised 15 dogs (10 mixed-breed dogs, 2 dachshunds, 1 Cairn terrier, 1 miniature pinscher, and 1 German pinscher, aged 8–19 years, including 11 males and 4 females) diagnosed with mitral valve disease combined with an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Population study and clinical findings in the examined groups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"/><th>DCM group</th><th>CMVD group</th><th rowspan="2">

      <p>Dogs in the DCM group were significantly younger and heavier than those from the CMVD group, but there was no difference in the LA/Ao ratio between both groups (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>There have been numerous histopathological characterisations of canine DCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, changes occurring in the atrial tissue in the course of DCM remain poorly described. Similarly to our findings, Everett et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] noted fibrosis and cardiomyocyte atrophy in specimens from the atria in Doberman pinschers with DCM. Those lesions were less extensive and less common than the lesions found in specimens from ventricles in the same animals.</p>
      <p>According to Schaper et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], normal cardiac tissue in failing hearts in humans is replaced by fibrosis. This is accompanied by changes within the cardiomyocyte nuclei (including nuclear enlargement). Sharov et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] noted a disruption in the structure of cardiomyocytes with subsequent fibrosis in dogs with heart failure. The authors associated myocardial fibrosis with changes in the expression of structural proteins. We observed lesions in cardiomyocytes and interstitial tissue in both groups, which may reflect the response of the heart to volume overload, as described in the abovementioned studies. In our study, there was more interstitial fibrosis and nuclear enlargement in the DCM group.</p>
      <p>When comparing ventricular specimens from dogs showing DCM and CMVD, Falk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] noticed that the majority of dogs with CMVD showed only a small degree of cardiomyocyte atrophy in the ventricular specimens or none at all. Such differences in the severity of cardiomyocyte degeneration were also observed in our study.</p>
      <p>Studies on dogs with CMVD showed that animals developing congestive heart failure present with lower values of LAR as compared to controls, although this parameter is highly variable in each dog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Falk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] showed that a decrease in LAR is directly associated with a decrease in fractional shortening in the left ventricle. This suggests the presence of alterations in intra-myocardial vessels in the course of heart dilation in CMVD. Although LAR is not a highly reliable parameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], its greater values observed in the DCM group in our study together with lower values of perivascular fibrosis may indicate that alterations in intra-mural vessels play a greater role in left atrial enlargement in CMVD than in DCM.</p>
      <p>DCM in dogs is often connected with the occurrence of supraventricular and ventricular rhythm disturbances. Sustained arrhythmias in CMVD occur less frequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Noszczyk-Nowak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and Crosara et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] demonstrated a higher risk of developing supraventricular arrhythmias in dogs with an enlarged left atrium, although this phenomenon is not well understood. It has not been established whether arrhythmias, also found in dogs in pre-clinical stages of DCM, are a consequence of primary myocardial changes or if myocardial lesions result from long-lasting rhythm disturbances and secondary heart chamber dilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
      <p>Recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] emphasize the role of myocardial fibrosis in the development and progression of atrial fibrillation (AF) of different aetiology in humans. Platanov et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] showed a significantly higher amount of connective tissue in heart specimens from patients with AF, compared to patients without atrial rhythm disturbances. Nattel and Harada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] highlighted the possible role of fibrosis in cardiac conduction disturbances.</p>
      <p>Frustaci et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] noted changes in the atrial myocardial structure (inflammation, non-inflammatory cardiomyopathy or fibrosis) in patients with lone atrial fibrillation without coexisting heart chamber dilation (including atrial diameter). Moreover, Tuomainen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] noted significantly lower values of the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, left ventricular end-diastolic volume and left ventricular end-systolic volume combined with a significantly higher value of the left atrial diameter in patients with chronic AF in DCM compared to patients with DCM and a sinus rhythm. Considering that all dogs with DCM in this study had an arrhythmia, it is impossible to determine whether the observed changes are a consequence of the primary myocardial disease or a consequence of the arrhythmia.</p>
      <p>One of the limitations of our study was a lack of dogs with DCM without rhythm disturbances, which could be compared to dogs included in the study. Dogs with DCM often develop rhythm disturbances before the development of clinical symptoms. Further studies including dogs with DCM without arrhythmias may improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of this disease.</p>
      <p>Another limitation was an observed difference between body weight, age and breed distribution in both groups. This was a result of the different clinical courses of both diseases. DCM mostly occurs in young large-breed dogs, while CMVD mostly occurs in old small-breed dogs. To minimize those differences, we used an increased LA/Ao ratio as an inclusion criterion. There was no difference in the LA/Ao ratio between both groups. Therefore, we assumed that the comparison of atrial remodelling in both groups was justifiable.</p>
      <p>The variety in the DCM group was a further limitation of the study. We included dogs with idiopathic DCM that developed arrhythmias in the course of the disease and dogs presenting with AF in the first examination. The latter dogs may have had tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. However, all the dogs in the DCM group did not respond well to treatment in late stages of the disease. They developed severe heart failure with left atrial enlargement, and presented with severe tachyarrhythmia at the time of death or prior to euthanasia. Hence, they were included in one group.</p>
      <p>The last limitation was a lack of assessment of atrial pressure in the examined dogs prior to the histopathologic examination in order to exclude its influence on atrial remodelling. We attempted to minimise the possibility of other reasons for atrial enlargement (e.g. mitral stenosis) by performing an accurate ante-mortem and post-mortem examination.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy show a different distribution of connective tissue, have less severe intra-myocardial arterial narrowing, and have more severe degenerative changes in the cardiomyocytes of the left atrium compared to dogs with chronic mitral valve disease. The changes noted in the atrial tissue from dogs in both groups resemble lesions noted in the ventricular tissue of dogs with the same diseases. Those differences may indicate that the atrial enlargement noted in DCM and CMVD has a different, disease-specific underlying mechanism and does not result only from volume overload.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Health system guidance (HSG) provides recommendations aimed to address health system challenges. However, there is a paucity of methods to direct, appraise, and report HSG. Earlier research identified 30 candidate criteria (concepts) that can be used to evaluate the quality of HSG and guide development and reporting requirements. The objective of this paper was to describe two studies aimed at evaluating the importance of these 30 criteria, design a draft HSG appraisal tool, and test its usability.</p>

          <p>This study involved a two-step survey process. In step 1, respondents rated the 30 concepts for appropriateness to, relevance to, and priority for health system decisions and HSG. This led to a draft tool. In step 2, respondents reviewed HSG documents, appraised them using the tool, and answered a series of questions. Descriptive analyses were computed.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Fifty participants were invited in step 1, and we had a response rate of 82 %. The mean response rates for each concept within each survey question were universally favorable. There was also an overall agreement about the need for a high-quality tool to systematically direct the development, appraisal, and reporting of HSG. Qualitative feedback and a consensus process by the team led to refinements to some of the concepts and the creation of a beta (draft) version of the HSG tool. In step 2, 35 participants were invited and we had a response rate of 74 %. Exploratory analyses showed that the quality of the HSGs reviewed varied as a function of the HSG item and the specific document assessed. A favorable consensus was reached with participants agreeing that the HSG items were easy to understand and easy to apply. Moreover, the overall agreement was high for the usability of the tool to systematically direct the development (85 %), appraisal (92 %), and reporting (81 %) of HSG. From this process, version 1.0 of the HSG appraisal tool was generated complete with 32 items (and their descriptions) and 4 domains.</p>

          <p>The final tool, named the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation for Health Systems (AGREE-HS) (version 1), defines expectations of HSG and facilitates informed decisions among policymakers on health system delivery, financial, and governance arrangements.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Defining features of a health system can have a significant and direct impact on the health of individuals and communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. By definition, a health system refers to governance arrangements (e.g., policy, organizational, or professional authority), financial arrangements (e.g., financing, funding, remuneration, or incentives), and delivery arrangements (e.g., to whom care is provided, by whom care is provided, or where care is provided) for health care and population health services and the broader context in which they are negotiated, implemented, and reformed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Strengthening health systems is increasingly seen as a foundation for optimizing and maintaining improvements in population health outcomes, as well as in improving the patient experience and keeping per capita costs manageable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>The achievement of health goals in several countries and regions has been hindered by a variety of challenges ranging from weak and dysfunctional health system features like existing delivery, financial, and governance arrangements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], through influences on the policy process that compromise efforts like institutions, interests, and ideas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], to context-specific features (political, social, cultural, and economic) that run counter to goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Improving the suitability of health systems to deliver health care and public health interventions is, therefore, an essential quality goal. To this end, there has been an international effort among health system research and leader communities to leverage evidence, best practices, and transparent and systematic methods to strengthen health systems. Health system guidance (HSG) are knowledge tools that can be used to achieve this complex goal.</p>
      <p>HSGs are systematically developed statements produced at global, national, and regional levels (e.g., by the World Health Organization, ministries and departments of health, and special committees supporting ministries and departments of health) that provide possible courses of action to address these challenges and thereby strengthen health systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For example, the international HSG from the World Health Organization (WHO) on task shifting addresses challenges related to critical workforce shortages, particularly in the area of maternal and newborn health in low-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This HSG recommends a more rational distribution of tasks and responsibilities among cadres of health workers as a strategy for improving access and cost-effectiveness within health systems. It focuses on essential components of the intervention (e.g., training of lay health workers), related actions (e.g., adaptations in task distributions), implementation issues (e.g., preferences), and the implications across other health system components (e.g., adaptations to the health information sub-system that may be needed to capture the tasks undertaken by such workers).</p>
      <p>While HSG have led efforts to support low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), system-level guidance has increasingly been seen in higher-income countries too. Cancer Care Ontario (CCO), an advisory body to the province of Ontario, Canada on matters related to quality in cancer, has recently extended its reach to include a more systems-level perspective. CCO has developed several guidance documents designed to inform the organization and delivery of cancer services. For example, its Models of Systemic Therapy guidance document recommends a four-level provincial system to optimize access and decrease wait times to chemotherapy agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The guidance delineates at each level the clinician team phenotype, institutional phenotype, equipment needs, and safety requirements as a function of the complexity of the treatments and the context in which care will be delivered (e.g., rural versus urban).</p>
      <p>Thus, HSG recommendations can help to determine appropriate ways to frame the problem of a population not having access to a primary care physician (e.g., supply, distribution, or payment problem), to outline viable options for health system arrangements that will strengthen primary care (e.g., financial and governance arrangements), to identify alternative implementation strategies that will get cost-effective programs, services, and drugs to those who need them, to monitor implementation efforts, and to evaluate their impacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>There are existing tools to support health systems. For example, while health system performance assessments (HSPA) report on the nature of a specific health problem, help prioritize topics, and evaluate achievements and progress towards HSG goals and recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], HSG is uniquely positioned to provide specific guidance to help solve a problem and to define the direction to which improvements can be made. The quality of HSG may, therefore, impact the type of recommendations being formulated, the degree to which they get implemented, the methods of dissemination, and the extent to which they impact the usual operations of the health system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Higher quality guidance has the capacity to contribute to higher quality policy decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] which in turn will better optimize health impacts through well-functioning health systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs)—guidance documents that target clinical questions and provide recommendations relevant to (primarily) clinician and patient decisions—could be considered conceptually equivalent knowledge tools to HSG. Both want to advance quality and improve outcomes, use relevant evidence appropriately, and ensure engagement of stakeholders to create implementable and sustainable solutions to health challenges. Optimizing health systems is a challenging task to which appropriate guidance can positively contribute, but there are conceptual and methodological issues unique to HSG that have compromised scientific advancement in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is a paucity of methods to direct the HSG development process, there is a lack of an appropriate conceptual model to appraise HSG quality, and there is a dearth of best practice strategies for reporting guidance recommendations. Health system leaders and researchers lack a framework to ensure that optimal HSG are produced and implemented.</p>
      <p>In contrast, there have been considerable advancements made regarding the science and practice of CPG development, appraisal, and reporting. For example, the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] is a reliable, valid, and internationally accepted tool used to direct the evaluation of CPGs and to inform development and reporting goals. Given the similarity in the ultimate aim of CPGs and HSGs, tools such as the AGREE II and the methods used to develop it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] could provide a foundation from which to strengthen the methodological underpinnings of HSGs. As more groups want to rely on the innovation of HSG, coupled with increasing pressures to demonstrate value for money, there has been an international call to action to create a tool and accompanying resources to support their use and ensure that the most valid, credible, and implementable guidance is identified and applied in health systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
      <p>In response, we are conducting a multi-stage program of research with the input of international HSG experts in order to create a reliable, valid, and useful tool for the appraisal of HSG that can also be used to support HSG development and reporting. To fully understand the HSG landscape, stage 1 of this research project was a review aimed at generating a candidate list of concepts (items/domains/criteria) that could comprise a potential HSG appraisal tool. We completed the review (using a critical interpretive synthesis—CIS—approach) of the literature in order to identify any published studies that report on existing criteria currently used to describe, differentiate, or test the quality of HSG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It was our expectation that the receptiveness, adoption, and diffusion of HSG recommendations depend on the perception of their quality, and with this review, we aimed to identify those core elements of a good quality HSG. From the CIS, we identified 30 candidate HSG quality criteria (concepts), clustered into 3 domains, and confirmed that no existing evaluation tool (draft or final version) exists for HSG.</p>
      <p>Applying international standards of measurement design for item generation, face validation, and reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], the overall goal of this study (stage 2) was twofold. The first goal was to have the intended users of a potential HSG appraisal tool evaluate the importance, value and priority of the 30 candidate concepts and definitions generated from the CIS, identify any missing components, and from these processes, draft a beta version of the tool. The second goal was to test the usability and performance of the beta version of the HSG tool, further test the face validity of the HSG items and their definitions, and test the anticipated value of the information it generates for users. The purpose of this paper is to report on this stage of the program of research.</p>

    <sec id="Sec2">
      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>The approach used for this study was two-step structured surveys targeted at international stakeholders in HSG development and implementation processes. Ethics approval was received from the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (REB#14-334) and financial support received from a peer-review grant by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</p>
      <p>For the purposes of this study, and with the goal to create a tool which had international and context relevance, we established an international advisory panel (AGREE HS Research team) comprised of researchers with expertise in strengthening health systems. Many of these advisors also had leadership roles in actual health systems (see the “Acknowledgements” section). With respect to the actual study participants, we sought individuals representing each of the six WHO regions and with health system leadership roles from a government policy lens, clinical lens, and/or health administrator lens.</p>
      <p>A candidate pool of potential participant was created by three means: authors listed in publicly available HSG documents, attendees from the Global Symposium of Health Systems Research and the Guidelines International Network Symposium, and by individuals nominated by members of the research team. Each candidate participant was tagged by jurisdiction and type of expertise. The selected individuals made up a master list that served as the population from which participants were purposively sampled for both steps 1 and 2.</p>
      <p>For both step 1 and step 2, candidate participants from our master list stratified by location and expertise were invited to participate in the surveys. Letters of invitation, describing the studies, were e-mailed to participants to solicit their participation. Individuals who agreed to participate were e-mailed a password-protected unique identifier to log into a Web-based study platform (LimeSurvey®) to complete the structured surveys. We also accommodated the requests of participants who preferred print packages of research materials. Our letters of invitation to participants outlined the purpose of the study, definition of key terms, likely time commitment, the survey process, and the expected output as well as conditions for participating. Periodic reminders were sent out to the invited participants over the study periods. The surveys were initially pilot-tested by some members of the scientific research team as well as some selected health services/systems researchers, to enable refinements prior to their distribution to consenting participants.</p>
      <sec id="Sec3">
        <title>Step 1</title>
        <p>During the 4-month study period for step 1, consenting survey participants were asked to evaluate each of the 30 candidate concepts for appropriateness to, relevance to, and priority for health system decisions and HSG. Each candidate concept was accompanied by an operational definition and considerations for scoring. Specifically, for each of the 30 concepts, participants were asked to rate their agreement with the following four key questions (measures):<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>This concept is a defining feature (core component) of HSG.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This is an important concept to address in the development process of HSG.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This is an important concept in the appraisal of HSG to differentiate between higher and lower quality guidance documents.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This is an important concept to be reported in HSG.</p></list-item></list></p>
        <p>A 7-point scale (1, strongly disagree to 7, strongly agree) was used to rate each of the concepts for each of the questions. In addition, participants were provided with the opportunity to suggest refinements and modifications to each of the candidate concepts (i.e., labels, definitions, etc.) and to suggest additional concepts not addressed in the list. Participants were also asked to rate their overall agreement about the need for a high-quality tool aimed to systematically appraise HSG and contribute to HSG development and reporting. Demographic questions that captured the participants’ gender, affiliation/organization, role/expertise, and years of experience were also included in the survey.</p>
        <p>Survey responses were downloaded into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and analyzed using Excel and SPSS. Overall descriptive analyses were calculated for each of the rated concepts (mean, standard deviation (SD), mode, median, and range). Items that 80 % or more of the respondents rated favorably on each of the four measures (between 5 and 7 on the response scale) were maintained. Those that did not meet this threshold were prioritized for discussion. Additional concepts nominated by the participants were reviewed by the scientific team and reworked to align with the style and format of the other candidate concepts. Written feedback was reviewed and a thematic analysis was done. Final decisions regarding the concepts were made through consensus by the core and extended members of the scientific team. The final list of concepts was reformatted to create the beta version (draft) of the HSG appraisal tool.</p>

      <sec id="Sec4">
        <title>Step 2</title>
        <p>The emerging beta version (draft) of the HSG tool was comprised of 32 items clustered into 4 domains. During the 3-month study period for step 2, we collected data on stakeholders’ experiences applying the draft tool on existing HSG documents. The object of inquiry for step 2 continued to be the tool and not the HSG documents themselves.</p>
        <p>We purposefully chose three WHO HSG documents from the McMaster University Health Forum’s Health System Evidence database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.healthsystemsevidence.org/">www.healthsystemsevidence.org</ext-link>). We purposively sampled HSG documents to ensure that we had a mix of (1) guidance addressing health system arrangements as the principal focus and addressing health system arrangements indirectly as a way to get the right mix of programs, services, and drugs to those who need them and (2) delivery, financial, and governance arrangements. Multiple participants rated each HSG document; however, the document was not a variable investigated in this study.</p>
        <p>Consenting participants were randomly assigned one of the three HSG documents. Participants were asked to (a) review the HSG document to which they were assigned, (b) review the beta version of the HSG appraisal tool, (c) apply the beta version of the HSG appraisal tool to appraise the HSG document to which they were assigned, (d) answer a series of questions about the appraisal process (i.e., feedback), and (e) provide demographic information.</p>
        <p>For the application of the tool, participants indicated whether the concept reflected in each item was documented in the HSG being assessed. Each item was accompanied by an operational definition and a binary response scale (yes/no). For this survey, only 30 of the items on the tool were used to appraise the HSG. Two of the items (implementation plan and evaluation plan) were excluded for this exercise as they only refer to the end users and how they can design a detailed implementation and evaluation plan at the local level for their individual contexts.</p>
        <p>Subsequent to the rating of the HSG document, participants were asked to rate their overall agreement on the usability of the HSG appraisal tool as an instrument to systematically direct the development of HSG, to direct the appraisal of HSG, and to direct what needs to be reported in HSG (Yes/No/Uncertain response scale). The participants were also asked to rate the usability of the HSG appraisal tool: were the concepts easy to understand, easy to apply, and was the Yes/No scale appropriate? (7-point scale, strongly disagree-strongly agree). The participants were asked to provide any additional comments on the survey process, on the content of the candidate concepts (operational descriptions/definitions) presented, and on the HSG appraisal tool (perceptions of its usefulness, appropriateness, ease of application). Demographic questions that captured the participants’ gender, affiliation/organization, role/position, years of experience, and previous participation in HSG development were also included.</p>
        <p>Survey responses were downloaded and analyzed using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Appropriate descriptive statistics were calculated for each of the question groups. The HSG appraisal tool scores were calculated (percentages of the Yes/No responses) and compared within and across the HSGs for exploratory purposes only. Usability of the HSG appraisal tool was assessed by calculating the percentages of Yes/No/Uncertain responses for each of the development, reporting, and evaluation metrics. Overall means were calculated on participants’ ratings that the instrument was easy to understand, the instrument was easy to use, and the rating scale was appropriate. We reviewed the qualitative feedback received and performed a thematic analysis. Final decisions regarding the concepts and the generation of a refined HSG appraisal tool were made through consensus of the members of our scientific team.</p>

      <p>Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the demographic details of the survey participants. The total number of participants invited to step 1 (the importance, value, and priority of the thirty candidate concepts) was 50, and the total number of respondents who completed the survey was 41, for a response rate of 82 %. For step 2, 35 invitations to participate in the usability testing of the beta version of the HSG tool were distributed and 26 complete surveys were returned (response rate of 74 %). For both surveys, the majority of the respondents were men. Respondents represented all six World Health Organization regions with the Americas and Europe most represented and the Eastern Mediterranean and Southeast Asia least represented. In terms of expertise, our respondents represented a variety of health system/health policy roles either at national health ministries or international health agencies, and others were health services/systems researchers either within academia or with applied research institutes. Participants’ years of experience in their roles/position ranged from 1 year to over 40 years. For step 2, we additionally collected data on participants’ years of health system experience and this ranged from 2 to 33 years. Two thirds of our respondents in step 2 had not participated in the development of a HSG document.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic details</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Step 1</th><th>Step 2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gender</td><td>Gender</td></tr><tr><td> Males = 31 (76 %)</td><td> Males = 19 (73 %)</td></tr><tr><td> Females = 10 (24 %)</td><td> Females = 7 (27 %)</td></tr><tr><td>WHO health region</td><td>WHO health region</td></tr><tr><td> Americas = 17 (41 %)</td><td> Americas = 6 (23 %)</td></tr><tr><td> Europe = 10 (25 %)</td><td> Europe = 5 (19 %)</td></tr><tr><td> Africa = 7 (17 %)</td><td> Africa = 4 (15 %)</td></tr><tr><td> Western Pacific = 4 (10 %)</td><td> Western Pacific = 4 (15 %)</td></tr><tr><td> Eastern Mediterranean = 2 (5 %)</td><td> Eastern Mediterranean = 4 (15 %)</td></tr><tr><td> Southeast Asia = 1 (3 %)</td><td> Southeast Asia = 3 (12 %)</td></tr><tr><td>Role/expertise</td><td>Role/expertise</td></tr><tr><td> Director = 8 (20 %)</td><td> Director = 5 (19 %)</td></tr><tr><td> Manager = 4 (10 %)</td><td> Manager = 3 (12 %)</td></tr><tr><td> Technical adviser = 9 (21 %)</td><td> Technical adviser = 6 (23 %)</td></tr><tr><td> Researcher (academia) = 8 (20 %)</td><td> Researcher (academia) = 9 (34 %)</td></tr><tr><td> Researcher (applied) = 12 (29 %)</td><td> Researcher (applied) = 3 (12 %)</td></tr><tr><td>Years of experience</td><td>Years of experience</td></tr><tr><td> 1–4 years = 5 (12 %)</td><td> 1–4 years = 5 (19 %)</td></tr><tr><td> 5–9 years = 12 (29 %)</td><td> 5–9 years = 7 (27 %)</td></tr><tr><td> 10–19 years = 11 (27 %)</td><td> 10–19 years = 7 (27 %)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="9"> 20+ years = 13 (32 %)</td><td> 20+ years = 7 (27 %)</td></tr><tr><td>Years of health system experience</td></tr><tr><td> 1–4 years = 10 (39 %)</td></tr><tr><td> 5–9 years = 10 (39 %)</td></tr><tr><td> 10–19 years = 2 (7 %)</td></tr><tr><td> 20+ years = 4 (15 %)</td></tr><tr><td>Participation in HSG development</td></tr><tr><td> Yes = 9 (34 %)</td></tr><tr><td> No = 17 (66 %)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

        <p>As can be seen in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, ratings were universally favorable and, for each concept, there was consistency in the mean ratings across the four metrics (i.e., core, development, appraisal, and reporting). For the <italic>core</italic> metric (<italic>C</italic>), mean ratings fell between 4.9 (political alignment) and 6.6 (interests managed, evidence-based, and relevant). For the <italic>development</italic> metric (<italic>D</italic>), mean ratings fell between 5.0 (political alignment) and 6.7 (systematic and transparent, participatory, and interests managed). For the <italic>appraisal</italic> metric (<italic>A</italic>), mean ratings fell between 4.7 (political alignment) and 6.7 (interests managed). And for the <italic>reporting</italic> metric (<italic>R</italic>), mean ratings fell between 5.0 (political alignment) and 6.7 (interests managed). Standard deviations for all the 30 concepts across all the four outcome measures were small, suggesting consistency in responses across participants.</p>
        <p>“Political alignment” was the least favorable concept; for two of the measures, <italic>core</italic> and <italic>appraisal</italic>, it did not reach the mean threshold of 5.0, scoring 4.9 and 4.7, respectively. Nonetheless, the members of our scientific team considered that this concept was important, and in view of the fact that it had only missed the threshold slightly, upon deliberation, the final consensus decision was to include it in the tool.</p>
        <p>We also recorded an overwhelmingly high and consistent overall mean agreement in relation to the need for a high-quality tool to systematically direct the development of HSG (6.6), to systematically direct the appraisal of HSG (6.6), and to systematically direct the reporting of HSG (6.3). The standard deviations and the ranges recorded were low, and the modes and medians were 7 for all three categories.</p>
        <p>Considerable feedback was also provided by the participants regarding refinements and changes to the wordings of the concepts and their descriptions. However, no additional unique items were suggested by the participants. Using the results and feedback from the survey, reconsiderations of the raw data from the review, and a series of meetings with the core and expanded members of the team (<italic>n</italic> = 11), the concept labels and descriptors were refined. Specifically, two of the concepts that emerged from the CIS (costs and resources) were merged to represent one concept (resources). Also, “process evaluation” and “outcomes/impact evaluation” were merged into “assessment plan”. Additionally, two of the concepts were split into two: “updating plan” became “updating plan” and “up-to-date”, while “systematic and transparent” became “systematic” and “transparent”. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> shows a table comparing the original labels and the new labels after the refinement process.</p>
        <p>The feedback from the survey and deliberations with members of the scientific team also led to the modification of the AGREE-HS framework that shows relationships between the concepts as well as relationships between clusters of the concepts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Building from our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], we clustered the concepts together into four meaningful categories (domains): process principles, content principles, context principles, and implementation/evaluation plan. In contrast to the original version of the framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], for this version, a double-headed arrow was added to depict the division of labor between roles at the global level and roles at the local level. At the local level, an additional category was added to represent the need for end users to design a detailed implementation and evaluation plan for their individual contexts. The implementation plan represents the development of a strategic plan by the end users to put the guidance recommendations into action. The evaluation plan entails the development of a monitoring and evaluation strategy for the process of implementation as well as the outcomes/impacts of the guidance recommendations. This brought the number of items to a total of 32 clustered into 4 domains.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Framework of health systems guidance concepts</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2015_365_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

        <p>Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> reports quality scores of applying the AGREE-HS on the HSG documents. As can be seen, this exploratory analysis demonstrates quality varied as a function of the AGREE-HS item and varied as a function of the HSG document being evaluated. For example, across the three HSG documents reviewed, higher quality was seen (as reflected with higher percentage of Yes responses) with the AGREE-HS concepts: priority (88, 100, and 100 % for HSG document <italic>X</italic>, <italic>Y</italic>, and <italic>Z</italic>, respectively), relevant (88, 100, and 100 %), timely (88, 90, and 88 %), and defined problem (100, 100, and 100 %). In contrast, lower quality was seen (as reflected with higher percentage of No responses) with the AGREE-HS concepts: cost-effectiveness (12, 30, and 63 % for HSG document <italic>X</italic>, <italic>Y</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>, respectively), assessment plan (25, 10, and 63 %), and external alignment (50, 40, and 12 %).<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Coverage of the AGREE-HS concepts in 3 HSG documents</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Concept</th><th colspan="2">HSG Document X<sup>**</sup>

        <p>With respect to AGREE-HS usability measures, participants reported an overall mean value of 5.9 and 5.6, respectively, when asked whether the concepts in the tool were easy to understand and were easy to apply. The standard deviations and the ranges were low, and the modes and medians were both 6 for these two items. In contrast, the mean ratings for the appropriateness of Yes/No scale were less favorable (4.1). Similar to step 1, there was affirmation that the AGREE-HS is a useful knowledge translation tool to systematically direct the development of HSG (85 %), to systematically direct the appraisal of HSG (92 %), and to systematically direct the reporting of HSG (81 %).</p>
        <p>We received substantial qualitative feedback from the survey respondents regarding the overall usability of the AGREE-HS tool, suggestions for further refinements, and challenges regarding the Yes/No rating scale that was used. With respect to the latter, participants reported that the dichotomous Yes/No response scale was not appropriate and too constraining for the purposes of evaluation and recommended either a three-item response scale (Yes/No/Partially) or a Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). Feedback was incorporated into the tool to create the version 1.0 of the AGREE-HS tool (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>In step 1 of our study, through a structured survey of relevant stakeholders from all six World Health Organization regions as well as feedback from members of our scientific team, we found that all the candidate concepts for the HSG tool met our a priori criteria for inclusion. Favorable ratings for each item emerged with each of the four target outcomes (i.e., to be included in HSG, to be part of HSG development, to be reported in HSG, and to a criteria on which to rate the quality of HSG). In addition, participants agreed that there was a need for an instrument of this type. These data with feedback led us to refine the HSG framework (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and to create a beta version of the AGREE HS that could be used for testing (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Together, the data from step 1 provided face validation to our concept of HSG and provided confidence to move the research agenda forward to step 2.</p>
      <p>In step 2, participants applied the beta version of the AGREE-HS to assess an HSG and provided feedback on the experience. Our findings showed favorable ratings on the usability of the tool. Items were reported to be easy to understand and easy to use. In contrast, the Yes/No response scale used in the beta version of the tool was not favorably rated. Corroborating findings in step 1, we again found strong support among the participants to create this tool and support for its contents. Finally, we found that in applying the beta version of the AGREE-HS to appraise the three HSG documents, variation in quality emerged between documents and across items, providing preliminary data in its ability to discriminate among HSG reports. Together, the data from step 2 led to refinements to the beta version of the tool. Our final product in this stage of the program of research is the HSG framework and the AGREE-HS version 1.0 (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). It is comprised of 32 items clustered into 4 domains, and each answered with a 5-point response scale (strongly disagree-strongly agree). To our knowledge, this is the first of their kind in the health system research domain.</p>
      <p>A key strategy for the production of an acceptable HSG tool is to adhere to standard methodological quality criteria (e.g., usable, reliable, and valid) that confer on guidance the credibility to be used and adapted. This study adds to the existing literature by moving from the generated HSG quality criteria (concepts) to providing a foundation for a knowledge tool and a common analytic framework for health systems that can ultimately improve the HSG enterprise. Given the evidence base upon which the items were generated and two separate studies with knowledge users reporting their favorable support for the concepts, we believe that we have successfully established the face validity of this tool. We believe that this tool will facilitate informed decision-making about HSG at various levels and promoting a culture of informed HSG developers and consumers.</p>
      <p>We believe that this tool could be applied by policymakers and health system administrative leaders to differentiate between higher and lower quality HSGs that they might use to inform policy decisions and system redesign. We also believe that these stakeholders could serve as important promoters in elevating the quality of HSG and use of evidence in health system thinking by making the AGREE-HS an expectation among the development community from whom they receive HSG. Developers can use the AGREE-HS as a blue print for their HSG methodological protocols and user manuals with respect to development and reporting expectations. Educators and researchers can use the AGREE-HS as a teaching tool to help learners acquire skills related to health systems.</p>
      <p>A strength of this study is that it involved a multidisciplinary blend of international participants recruited based on geography and expertise in order to cover various perspectives and jurisdictions. Secondly, it involved a high-quality approach adapted from the methodological, conceptual, and theoretical principles of measurement construction used to design a complementary tool, AGREE II, which aims to facilitate the development, appraisal, and reporting of clinical practice guidelines. Our methodology was sequential (one step led to the next), differentiated (each step represented a distinctive study required to move to the next step), and cumulative (each step produced data that fed into the overall process). Thirdly, it involved an iterative collaborative process with members of our core and expanded team comprised of investigators and collaborators with an extensive knowledge in health system and policy research. Fourthly, we recruited qualified participants worldwide to ensure that the study resonates with low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Lastly, we asked a wide variety of broad questions that permitted an understanding of the various dimensions of the usefulness of the tool as well as potential areas where issues may arise.</p>
      <p>A limitation of this study was that the sample size meant that we did not have sufficient power to also conduct a factor analysis to determine the clustering of items. While not part of the scope of this study, a factor analysis is an important step in the development of a measurement tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Similarly, and again while not in scope for this stage of the program of research, in a larger sample size, we would have been able to do sub-group analysis to see whether there was any variation in the ratings of the concepts or the ratings of the tool that match directly into specific roles/expertise or jurisdictions. These issues are both being considered for a future study. While it is possible that different results may have emerged with a different sample or a larger sample of participants, the consistency in ratings across participants and small standard deviations give us confidence that our results reflect the perceptions of our targeted communities. Thirdly, while we had an excellent response rate for both steps 1 and 2, we have little information about the demographic characteristics of non-responders and/or the reasons for not responding.</p>
      <p>The next steps of our research program involve developing a user manual with more explanations and detailed examples, as well as developing an on-line training program that will be useful for potential users of the tool. We will also proceed with further usability testing, reliability testing, validity testing, and refinement of the AGREE-HS version 1.0 in order to generate the alpha version ready for international unveiling and branding. Of particular interest will be to test its construct validity, its reliability, and its applicability to the various HSGs that exist. We also plan to promote the use of the tool internationally to groups who develop HSG and collate HSG in on-line system directories. The AGREE-HS will join the AGREE family of tools aimed to promote the use of evidence-informed guidance (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.agreeetrust.org">www.agreeetrust.org</ext-link>). As we have done with CPGs, our goal is that, through this project, we will contribute to bolstering collaborations among global experts with a wide array of expertise by working towards a common health research goal of creating better quality and more implementable HSG that will improve critical decision-making and lead to stronger health systems for the benefit of patients and populations.</p>

          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Dysregulated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling is a common occurrence in basal-like and triple-negative breast cancer (BTBC). As a result, RTK-targeting therapies have been initiated but proved difficult, mainly owing to the multiplicity of dysregulated RTKs. Hence, targeting master regulators of RTK signaling might alleviate this obstacle. Before that, however, defining the mechanism of such molecules is required. In this report, we show that the Src homology phosphotyrosyl phosphatase 2 (SHP2) is a master regulator of RTK expression and signaling in BTBC.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Xenograft tumor growth studies were used to determine the effect of SHP2 inhibition on tumorigenesis and/or metastasis. Cell proliferation rate, anchorage-independent growth, mammosphere formation, and ALDEFLUOR assays were used to compare the relative functional importance of SHP2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in BTBC cells. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses were used to determine the state of SHP2 and EGFR coexpression in BTBC. Analysis of mitogenic and cell survival signaling was performed to show SHP2’s role in signaling by multiple RTKs.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Inhibition of SHP2 in BTBC cells suppresses their tumorigenic and metastatic properties. Because EGFR is the most commonly dysregulated RTK in BTBC, we first tested the effect of SHP2 inhibition on EGFR signaling and found that SHP2 is important not only for mediation of the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways but also for the expression of the receptor itself. The existence of a tight association between SHP2 and EGFR expression in tumors and cell lines further suggested the importance of SHP2 in EGFR expression. Comparison of relative biological significance showed the superiority of SHP2 inhibition over that of EGFR, suggesting the existence of additional RTKs regulated by SHP2. Indeed, we found that the expression as well as the signaling efficiency of c-Met and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, two other RTKs known to be dysregulated in BTBC, are SHP2-dependent. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of SHP2 acting both upstream and downstream of RTKs to promote signaling.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>SHP2 upregulates the expression and signaling of multiple RTKs to promote BTBC. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the superiority of SHP2 inhibition in BTBC.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Of all breast cancer subtypes, basal-like and triple-negative breast cancer (BTBC) is the most aggressive form, causing disproportionately high mortality in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The lack of targeted therapy, together with the multiplicity of dysregulated molecules, is the major factor that exacerbates poor clinical outcomes. Dysregulation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR; also called <italic>c-Met</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], is one of the major molecular aberrations in BTBC. Of these, EGFR is the most commonly dysregulated RTK in BTBC.</p>
      <p>EGFR belongs to a family of RTKs that includes EGFR itself, EGFR2, EGFR3, and EGFR4. The human counterparts are called human EGFR1–EGFR4 (or HER1–HER4). All members are composed of an extracellular region, a single-pass transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region. With the exception of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), all members are activated by ligand binding to the extracellular domain, and all except HER3 have a functional tyrosine kinase domain in the cytoplasmic regions. Activation leads to homo- or heterodimerization at the cell surface and transphosphorylation in the C-terminal tail in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Phosphorylated Tyr residues serve as binding sites for Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine binding domain–containing signaling proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>Because EGFR is a potent activator of mitogenic and cell survival signaling, its overexpression in cancer is suggested to contribute to tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], on the basis of which anti-EGFR therapies are being sought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A large body of literature shows that Src homology phosphotyrosyl phosphatase 2 (SHP2) is an essential downstream effector of EGFR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, it is entirely possible that dysregulated EGFR signaling in BTBC also is SHP2-dependent. The upregulated expression of SHP2 in breast cancer, including BTBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and its positive role in breast cancer cell transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] provide supporting evidence for this possibility. SHP2 is a cytoplasmic protein with two SH2 domains in the N terminal region and a phosphotyrosyl phosphatase domain in the C-terminal region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The PTPase function of SHP2 is activated by interaction with Tyr-phosphorylated receptors and adaptor proteins through its SH2 domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, dysregulated tyrosine kinase signaling in BTBC can superactivate SHP2.</p>
      <p>We recently demonstrated that SHP2 promotes the transformation and invasive property of BTBC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], but its role on BTBC tumorigenesis in vivo was not determined. In addition, the molecular mechanism of SHP2 in promoting BTBC is unknown. In this report, we show, for the first time to our knowledge, that SHP2 promotes BTBC tumorigenesis by mediating not only downstream RTK signaling but also receptor expression.</p>

        <p>Female non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Approximately 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> MDA-MB-231 or 10<sup>6</sup> MDA-MB-468 cells expressing control or SHP2 shRNA were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected into the mammary fat pad of each mouse. Because shRNA-2 (sh-2) was more efficient in silencing SHP2 expression, we used these cells for inducing tumorigenesis. We used 13 mice for the MDA-MB-231–derived cells (6 for control and 7 for shRNA) and 12 for the MDA-MB-468 cells (6 for control and 6 for shRNA) in these studies. Tumor growth was monitored by measuring tumor volume with a caliper. The length (L) and the width (W) were measured directly, and the height was estimated by calculating the average of the two measurements. Hence, the formula L × W × (L + W)/2 was used to obtain tumor volume in cubic millimeters. Tumors, lungs, and liver tissues were harvested after the mice were killed. All experiments were performed according to the West Virginia University Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.</p>

        <title>Inhibition of SHP2 in BTBC cells suppresses tumorigenesis and metastasis</title>
        <p>The role of SHP2 on BTBC tumorigenesis was studied by intramammary transplantation of control and SHP2-silenced BTBC cells in NOD/SCID mice. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, which are known to be basal-like and triple-negative and to harbor multiple genetic aberrations commonly discovered in BTBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], were used for these studies. The expression of SHP2 was silenced with two independent shRNAs (sh-1 and sh-2) that were previously shown to be highly specific and devoid of any off-target effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Immunoblotting data demonstrating the efficiency of SHP2 silencing is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. Because sh-2 showed efficient silencing, we chose these cells for in vivo studies.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>In vivo tumorigenesis studies. <bold>a</bold> Analysis of Src homology phosphotyrosyl phosphatase 2 (SHP2) expression in parental (P), control (C), shRNA-1 (sh-1), and shRNA-2 (sh-2) cells derived from MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. <bold>b</bold> Tumor growth rate initiated by transplantation of control (Con) and SHP2-silenced (sh-2) cells derived from the MDA-MB-231 cell line.

        <p>Tumors induced by MDA-MB-231 cells grew very slowly, reaching approximately 250 mm<sup>3</sup> in the controls and 50 mm<sup>3</sup> in the shRNA cells within about 9 weeks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Around this time, the control mice manifested clinical symptoms such as shortened breathing and reduced demeanor. These mice were killed in succession as they developed these symptoms. However, none of the shRNA mice developed such symptoms, even by 16 weeks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). These findings suggest that inhibition of SHP2 suppresses tumorigenesis and confers survival.</p>
        <p>Hematoxylin and eosin (H &amp; E)–stained sections of mammary tumors showed invasive carcinoma in the controls and connective tissue–encapsulated small tumors in the shRNA mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Similar analysis of lung and liver sections showed multiple pulmonary and liver metastases in the controls and no such lesions in the shRNA mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). These results demonstrate that silencing SHP2 expression in the MDA-MB-231 cells suppressed tumorigenesis and/or metastasis.</p>
        <p>Tumors induced by the control MDA-MB-468 cells grew relatively quickly, reaching approximately 2300 mm<sup>3</sup> over the course of 7 weeks, but SHP2-silenced tumors did not reach even 500 mm<sup>3</sup> during this time (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1a). Clinically, tumor burden was the major issue with this cell line. As a result, we used an average tumor size of 2000 mm<sup>3</sup> as an endpoint to determine survival. We found that tumors in the control mice reached this point within 7 weeks, while none in the shRNA mice did even by 13 weeks. Analysis of H &amp; E–stained tissue sections showed only local invasiveness in the mammary glands of control mice (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1b and c). Regardless of this, inhibition of SHP2 suppressed the tumorigenic property of this cell line as well.</p>

        <title>SHP2 promotes sustained EGFR expression and signaling in BTBC cells</title>
        <p>Dysregulation of EGFR in BTBC is suggested to promote tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Because SHP2 is a downstream effector of EGFR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], its positive role in BTBC could be through this mechanism. In the present study, time course EGF stimulation studies showed that EGF-induced Ras, ERK1/2, and Akt activation was suboptimal and short-lived in SHP2-silenced cells but robust and sustained in controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–d</xref>). Hence, SHP2 is essential for dysregulated EGFR signaling in BTBC cells.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Effect of Src homology phosphotyrosyl phosphatase 2 (SHP2) silencing on epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced signaling.

        <p>Because ligand-induced receptor processing impacts signaling output, we analyzed the same total cell lysates for EGFR to see if loss of SHP2 affects this process. Surprisingly, we found that the level of EGFR in the SHP2-silenced cells was very low in the first place and rapidly degraded upon EGF stimulation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2a and b). To substantiate these findings, we analyzed total cell lysates from the parental, the control, and the two SHP2 shRNA cells for basal EGFR levels and found a 6–8-fold reduction in the SHP2-silenced cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e and f</xref>). We also analyzed tumor samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) for EGFR protein level and ERK1/2 and Akt activation and found a drastic reduction in the SHP2-silenced tumors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). To rule out the possibility of shRNA-mediated artifact, we inhibited SHP2 function by dominant-negative SHP2 expression (C459S-SHP2) and found a 5–8-fold reduction in EGFR level when compared with the wild-type counterpart or vector alone (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2c and d). Hence, SHP2 positively regulated EGFR expression.</p>

        <title>SHP2 promotes elevated EGFR expression at both protein and mRNA levels</title>
        <p>On the basis of the data shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, we reasoned that SHP2 might act at a protein or mRNA level, or at both levels, to promote EGFR expression. Initially, we determined the effect of SHP2 on EGFR protein stability. Because membrane proteins such as EGFR are degraded primarily by the lysosomal system, we conducted lysosome inhibition studies by treating cells with 100 μg/ml chloroquine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] for variable times. Lysosome inhibition led to a partial restoration of EGFR in the SHP2-silenced cells with minimal effect in the controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a and c</xref>). Reprobing for β-actin showed comparable loading in each lane. EGFR band density measurements confirmed an approximately 50 % EGFR restoration within 6 h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b and d</xref>). These findings suggest that SHP2 promotes stable EGFR expression in BTBC cells at least in part by suppressing lysosomal degradation.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Effect of Src homology phosphotyrosyl phosphatase 2 (SHP2) silencing on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression.

        <p>To corroborate the effect of SHP2 on EGFR protein stability, we studied the dynamics of ligand-induced EGFR degradation after stabilizing EGFR with chloroquine. Analysis of total cell lysates showed rapid EGFR degradation in the SHP2-silenced cells and less rapid degradation in the controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3a). Comparison of average band densities against the starting point in each group showed a 75 % EGFR drop within 1 h in the SHP2-silenced cells and only a 30 % drop within 4 h in the controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3b). These findings suggest that SHP2 suppresses EGFR degradation to promote elevated expression.</p>
        <p>To confirm the immunoblotting findings, we conducted time course fluorescence studies after stabilizing EGFR as described above (see <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>). EGF-bound EGFR was localized primarily at the plasma membrane at the zero time point. Incubation at 37 °C led to internalization within 10 min in both groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3c). Further incubation led to a rapid decay in EGF-bound EGFR in the SHP2-silenced cells, but less so in the controls. In addition, differences in receptor distribution were observed after 10 min. While EGF-bound EGFR in the controls was sorted in a polarized fashion (in reference to the nucleus), it was retained in the perinuclear region in the SHP2-silenced cells. These findings confirm the immunoblotting data and further show that SHP2 suppresses ligand-induced EGFR degradation by modulating the process of sorting.</p>
        <p>The hypersensitivity of EGFR to ligand-induced degradation in the SHP2-silenced cells was indicative of enhanced EGFR ubiquitination. We tested this possibility after stabilizing EGFR with chloroquine and stimulating with EGF for 2, 5, or 10 min, a time range that shows maximal receptor ubiquitination. On one hand, EGFR was ubiquitinated even in the basal state in the SHP2-silenced cells, which increased upon EGF stimulation. On the other hand, EGFR ubiquitination in the controls was undetectable in the basal state and weakly detectable after EGF stimulation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3d). Hence, SHP2 modulated EGFR ubiquitination to promote stability.</p>
        <p>Because lysosome inhibition did not lead to complete restoration of EGFR, we reasoned that SHP2 might also promote EGFR expression at an mRNA level. qRT-PCR analysis showed that silencing SHP2 expression led to a 9–10-fold decrease in EGFR mRNA level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>). These findings show that SHP2 is important not only for EGFR protein stability but also for mRNA expression.</p>

        <title>SHP2 and EGFR are co-overexpressed in BTBC tumors and cell lines</title>
        <p>On the basis of the data shown in Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, we reasoned that both EGFR and SHP2 expression might be dysregulated in BTBC due to stoichiometric requirements.

        <p>Tumors positive for both proteins were further analyzed by IF microscopy to confirm co-overexpression. In these analyses, we also paid particular attention to heterogeneous regions in each tumor.

Consistent with the findings in BTBC tumors, EGFR and SHP2 were co-overexpressed in BTBC cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Compared with parental MCF-10A or HMLE cells, EGFR and SHP2 were overexpressed 4–6-fold in BTBC and experimentally produced cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Also, the positive control BT-474 cells had more than 7-fold SHP2. Hence, co-overexpression of SHP2 and EGFR is commonplace.</p>

        <title>SHP2 inhibition is superior to EGFR inhibition in suppressing cell transformation</title>
        <p>Because SHP2 is important for EGFR expression and signaling, we reasoned that its positive role in BTBC might be through this mechanism. To test this possibility, we compared the relative biological significance of SHP2 and EGFR in BTBC cells. First, the expression of EGFR was silenced using two shRNA constructs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) that were previously shown to be specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Next, we compared the effect of SHP2 and EGFR silencing on cell proliferation. While SHP2 inhibition suppressed cell proliferation by about 3–4-fold, EGFR inhibition led to only 1.5-fold suppression of cell proliferation within 3 days (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b and c</xref>). Thus, SHP2 inhibition is more efficient than EGFR inhibition in suppressing cell growth.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Effect of Src homology phosphotyrosyl phosphatase 2 (SHP2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) silencing on cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and mammosphere formation. <bold>a</bold> Immunoblotting analysis of EGFR silencing with two independent short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. <bold>b</bold> Effect of EGFR and SHP2 silencing on cell proliferation in MDA-MB-231 cells. <bold>c</bold> Effect of EGFR and SHP2 silencing on cell proliferation in MDA-MB-468 cells. <bold>d</bold> Effect of EGFR and SHP2 silencing on anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. <bold>e</bold> Colony numbers from three independent experiments in MDA-MB-231 cells cultured as shown in (<bold>d</bold>). <bold>f</bold> Colony numbers from three independent experiments in MDA-MB-468 cells cultured as shown in (<bold>d</bold>). <bold>g</bold> Effect of EGFR and SHP2 silencing on mammosphere formation in MDA-MB-231 cells. <bold>h</bold> Effect of EGFR and SHP2 silencing on proportion of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDO)-high cells in MDA-MB-231 cells. <italic>P</italic> parental, <italic>C</italic> control, <italic>sh-1</italic> SHP2 shRNA-1, <italic>sh-2</italic> SHP2 shRNA-2, <italic>Esh1</italic> EGFR shRNA-1, <italic>Esh2</italic> EGFR shRNA-2, <italic>SSC</italic> side scatter</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13058_2015_659_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p>
        <p>We also compared the effect of SHP2 and EGFR silencing on anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. On one hand while the parental and the control cells formed larger and more numerous colonies, the SHP2-silenced cells formed smaller and fewer ones (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). On the other hand, silencing EGFR led to a modest decrease in colony number only. Viewing under the 4× lens objective showed 22 larger colonies per field in the controls and only 2–4 smaller colonies in the SHP2-silenced cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e and f</xref>). With regard to EGFR, the average colony number in silenced cells was approximately 11 per field. These results suggest that SHP2 plays a major role in cell transformation, while EGFR makes a significant but relatively modest contribution.</p>
        <p>The inability of the SHP2-silenced cells to grow in soft agar indicated a role for SHP2 in cancer stem cell (CSC) biology. To verify this point, we compared the mammosphere-forming capacity of SHP2- and EGFR-silenced cells in suspension cultures in which cells with stem-like properties only can survive and form these structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. On one hand, whereas mammosphere-forming efficiency in the parental and control cells was increased on successive passaging from primary to secondary cultures, it was exhausted in the SHP2-silenced cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S5a). On the other hand, the impact of EGFR silencing was noticeable only in secondary cultures, where a modest decrease in mammosphere number was observed. A further property of CSC is increased ALDH1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] as determined using the ALDEFLUOR assay. We used this assay to confirm the mammosphere findings. On one while the control MDA-MB-231 cells had 4.97 % ALDH1-high cells, the corresponding SHP2-silenced cells had only 0.23 %, a more than 20-fold reduction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5h</xref>). On the other hand, the EGFR-silenced cells had 2.3 % ALDH1-high cells, suggesting a relatively modest decrease. Similar results were obtained with the MDA-MB-468 cells (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S5b). Thus, SHP2 is more important than EGFR in promoting CSC phenotypes in BTBC cells.</p>

        <title>SHP2 promotes the expression and signaling of FGFR1 and c-Met in BTBC cells</title>
        <p>The prominence of SHP2 inhibition over that of EGFR in suppressing cell transformation was suggestive of SHP2 controlling additional RTKs that are known to be dysregulated in BTBC, such as c-Met and FGFR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We thus determined the effect of SHP2 silencing on FGFR and c-Met signaling in the same BTBC cells. Serum-starved cells were stimulated with either FGF or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) for varying times, and lysates prepared from them were analyzed for ERK1/2 and Akt activation. Both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were highly responsive to stimulation with either ligand as determined by a robust activation of ERK1/2 and Akt. While HGF- and FGF-induced ERK1/2 and Akt activation was suboptimal and short-lived in the SHP2-silenced cells, it was augmented and sustained in the controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a–d</xref>). Hence, SHP2 regulates signaling of multiple RTKs in BTBC cells.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Effect of Src homology phosphotyrosyl phosphatase 2 (SHP2) silencing on fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and c-Met expression and signaling. <bold>a</bold> Effect of SHP2 silencing on fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-induced signaling in the MDA-MB-231 cells. <bold>b</bold> Effect of SHP2 silencing on FGF-induced signaling in the MDA-MB-468 cells. <bold>c</bold> Effect of SHP2 silencing on hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced signaling in the MDA-MB-231 cells. <bold>d</bold> Effect of SHP2 silencing on HGF-induced signaling in the MDA-MB-468 cells.

        <p>As described in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, SHP2 promotes EGFR expression. We thus reasoned that SHP2 might also promote c-Met and FGFR1 expression in BTBC cells. To address this point, we analyzed the protein levels of both receptors under basal growth conditions by immunoblotting total cell lysates with specific antibodies. Similarly to EGFR, the protein levels of FGFR1 and c-Met were very low in the SHP2-silenced cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). Band density measurements confirmed that the levels of FGFR1 and c-Met in the SHP2-silnced cells were lower by 4–5-fold compared with the parental and the control cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>). Hence, SHP2 is essential for the expression of FGFR and c-Met in BTBC cells, and its inhibition leads to their downregulation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Dysregulation of multiple RTKs, including EGFR, FGFR1, and HGFR (also called <italic>c-Met</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], is one of the major molecular aberrations in BTBC. As a result, efforts have been made to develop RTK-targeting therapies to treat BTBC. However, the results so far show that anti-RTK drugs are ineffective when given individually and toxic when administered in combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. It is therefore imperative to discover and target master regulators of RTK signaling to overcome this obstacle. In this report, we have presented evidence showing that SHP2 functions as a master regulator of RTK expression and signaling in BTBC, suggesting its potential for targeted therapy in BTBC.</p>
      <p>Recently, we demonstrated that SHP2 promotes the transformation and invasive properties of BTBC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, its role in tumorigenesis in vivo was not determined. In this report, we have demonstrated that inhibition of SHP2 effectively suppresses tumor growth induced by intramammary transplantation of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1a). One of the most interesting observations in mice bearing the control MDA-MB-231 tumors was the development of clinical symptoms such as increased breathing rate and reduced demeanor while the tumors were still small. Silencing SHP2 expression effectively blocked the development of these symptoms. Histopathological analysis later showed extensive lung and liver metastatic lesions in the control mice but not in the SHP2 shRNA mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d and e</xref>), validating the observed clinical symptoms. These findings mimic the pathogenesis of BTBC in women in whom metastasis is often observed while the tumors are still small. Hence, inhibition of SHP2 in BTBC may mitigate distant metastasis.</p>
      <p>Another interesting observation was that mice bearing SHP2-silenced MDA-MB-231 tumors survived far beyond the control group without manifesting any clinical symptoms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Similar results were obtained with the MDA-MB-468 cells in terms of tumor burden, which is the major clinical manifestation with this cell line (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1b). These findings imply that inhibition of SHP2 has the potential to provide a survival benefit to BTBC patients.</p>
      <p>Although the positive role of SHP2 in normal RTK signaling is known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], its role in dysregulated RTK signaling in cancer is unclear. In this report, we have shown that EGFR, the most commonly dysregulated RTK in BTBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], cannot effectively activate downstream signaling without SHP2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–d</xref>). Unexpectedly, we discovered a new role for SHP2: promoting elevated EGFR expression in BTBC cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e and f</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2a–d). Hence, SHP2 functions not only downstream but also upstream of the EGFR.</p>
      <p>One of the mechanisms for SHP2 in promoting elevated EGFR expression was through blocking ubiquitination and ligand-induced degradation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3). However, our findings are in contrast to those in a recent report that suggested otherwise on the basis of transient expression of dominant-negative SHP2 with c-Cbl and Spry2 in COS1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In our studies, expression of dominant-negative SHP2 downregulates EGFR (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2c). These discrepancies might be related to cellular context and technical differences used in the two studies. While in our studies we used constitutive SHP2 inhibition with two different approaches (shRNA and dominant-negative SHP2), the researchers in the other study used transient co-overexpression. Nonetheless, our data are consistent with SHP2 positively regulating EGFR protein stability.</p>
      <p>The incomplete recovery of EGFR by lysosome inhibition was an indication of the existence of additional mechanisms used by SHP2 to promote elevated EGFR expression. Indeed, the qRT-PCR analysis showed an approximately 16-fold reduction in EGFR mRNA level in SHP2-silenced BTBC cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>). These findings add more complexity to the mechanism of SHP2 in regulating EGFR expression. They suggest that SHP2 promotes elevated EGFR expression at both protein and mRNA levels.</p>
      <p>The tight association of EGFR and SHP2 overexpression in BTBC tumors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S4 and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and the positive role of SHP2 in EGFR expression in BTBC cells (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) suggest that SHP2 might also promote EGFR overexpression in BTBC patient tumors. Although our sample size was relatively small, the SHP2 and EGFR results are in agreement with previously reported data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], supporting the validity of our data. However, the mechanism that leads to elevated SHP2 expression and promotion of EGFR mRNA level by SHP2 are unclear at this stage. Future studies addressing these questions might be needed.</p>
      <p>We have demonstrated that SHP2 plays a major role, while EGFR makes a modest contribution, in promoting BTBC cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and CSC phenotypes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S5). The complementarity of the mammosphere and ALDH1 findings suggests that SHP2 plays a pivotal role in CSC survival and propagation, minority cell populations known to perpetuate tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Thus, it is entirely possible that inhibition SHP2 might lead to elimination of CSCs in tumors, but future studies addressing this point are needed.</p>
      <p>The superiority of SHP2 inhibition over EGFR inhibition led to the discovery that SHP2 also controls the expression and signaling activities of FGFR1 and c-Met (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), two other RTKs known to be dysregulated in BTBC. The most novel finding was that SHP2 is essential not only for downstream signaling but also for expression of both FGFR1 and c-Met. Although our data do not delineate between gene expression and protein stability, we speculate that SHP2 promotes FGFR1 and c-Met expression by acting at both protein and mRNA levels, similar to its role in EGFR signaling. Future studies are needed to verify these points.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>In this report, we show that inhibition of SHP2 blocks BTBC tumorigenesis and/or metastasis. We also show that SHP2 mediates the expression and signaling activities of multiple RTKs, including EGFR, FGFR1, and c-Met, to promote BTBC. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that SHP2 acts both upstream and downstream of RTKs to promote their oncogenic signaling. This effect of SHP2 might be responsible for its superior role compared with EGFR inhibition. Subsequent studies are needed to answer some of the questions raised in this report.</p>

                <p>Dynamics of EGFR degradation in the MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence and absence of SHP2. a First EGFR was stabilized by chloroquine treatment for 6 h, and then cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for the indicated times. Lysates prepared from these cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-EGFR antibody. As shown, EGFR was degraded relatively rapidly in the SHP2-silenced cells but not in the controls. The anti-SHP2 and anti-β-actin immunoblotting show efficient SHP2 silencing and comparable total protein loading, respectively. b Band density measurement of the EGFR immunoblotting. As shown, approximately 75 % of EGFR in the SHP2-silnced cells was degraded within 1 h, but only 30 % was degraded in the controls even at the 4-h time point. Data shown are mean ± standard error of three independent experiments. With regard to the effect of SHP2 silencing on EGFR endocytosis and processing in the MDA-MB-231 cells, EGF-induced EGFR endocytosis was affected not by SHP2 silencing, but by the processing thereafter. While EGFR in the controls was sorted in polarized fashion with gradual outward extension, it remained perinuclear in the SHP2 silenced cells. In addition, it was possible to discern the rapid dissipation of the EGFR signal in the SHP2-silenced cells but not in the controls. With regard to the effect of SHP2 silencing on EGFR ubiquitination in the MDA-MB-231 cells, first EGFR was stabilized by chloroquine treatment for 6 h and then cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for the indicated times. Lysates prepared from these cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-EGFR and immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. To compensate for the partial EGFR restoration by chloroquine, the amount of EGFR precipitate loaded in the shRNA lanes was increased by 25 %. As shown, EGFR was rapidly and highly ubiquitinated in the SHP2-silenced cells but less so in the controls. Reprobing with anti-EGFR antibody showed comparable protein levels in all lanes.

          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>A participatory research design was employed. Four educational psychology researchers, eight undergraduate medical school students and two accredited PBL tutors participated in a four-month research programme. Data were collected through participatory observation, focus groups, semi-structured interviews, workshop documents and feedback surveys and then subjected to thematic content analysis. The triangulation of sources and member checking were used to ensure the credibility and trustworthiness of the research process.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Five themes emerged from the analysis: current experience of PBL curriculum; the roles of and relationships between tutors and students; student group dynamics; development of self-directed learning; and coaching in PBL facilitation. On the basis of this empirical data, a systematic model of PBL and coaching psychology was developed.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>The findings highlighted that coaching psychology could be incorporated into the facilitation system in PBL. The integrated framework of PBL and coaching psychology in undergraduate medical education has the potential to promote the development of the learning goals of cultivating clinical reasoning ability, lifelong learning capacities and medical humanity. Challenges, benefits and future directions for implementing the framework are discussed in this paper.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Problem-based learning (PBL) is essentially a strategic learning system that represents a major shift in the educational paradigm from teacher-centred to student-centred learning. It aims to enhance collaborative, contextual, integrated, self-directed and reflective learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although PBL may take various forms in different institutions, it is generally built on the following principles: relevant, authentic problems form the basis of teaching and learning; students as the central players and active seekers of knowledge; and learning through collaboration and discussions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Essential features of PBL include an interdisciplinary approach, authentic activities that are valued in the real world, ill-structured problems, students’ collaboration, individually collected information, groups’ decision-making process, discussion of principles and goals, and self- and peer-assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>As an instructional method pervasively employed in medical education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], PBL has been adopted in Mainland China since the mid-1980s as a means of cultivating students’ practical learning capacities and, ultimately, promoting lifelong learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Chinese medical schools have been making efforts to explore their own PBL approaches based on their educational conditions, human resources and existing curriculum structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Most Chinese medical schools select and incorporate some essential features of PBL into their existing curriculum as a hybrid model in which the majority of teaching is done through didactic lectures and practical classes with a small proportion of PBL intermixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Currently, the implementation of PBL in relation to medical research in China remains in its infancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
      <p>From an instructive perspective, PBL emphasises the importance of understanding not only content but also disciplinary epistemologies and investigative strategies through collaborative problem solving and sense making, reflecting on experiences, developing evidence-based explanations, communicating ideas, enhancing discipline-specific reasoning skills and engaging in self-directed inquiry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. To successfully use PBL, students must take responsibility for the learning process. However, for many students, this does not occur naturally or easily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that PBL fosters the development of self-directed, lifelong learning <italic>as long as students are supported and guided</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, facilitation as a supporting system is central to the process of PBL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This supporting system involves a rigorous, structured and flexible approach delivered by PBL tutors, whose role should be facilitative rather than didactic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. PBL tutors are required to acquire a mixture of direct and non-directive facilitation techniques built on humanistic attitudes of education that support significant, meaningful and experiential learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The directive facilitation approach is important given the complex nature of PBL; for example, a tutor may provide direct instruction on a just-in-time basis when students are experiencing difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
      <p>The non-directive facilitative approach is particularly related to the perspective of coaching psychology, which is epistemologically based on humanistic philosophy. Coaching psychology focuses on ‘enhancing well-being and performance in personal life and work domains underpinned by models of coaching grounded in established learning theories or psychological approaches’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It has been studied extensively in the educational context for a variety of purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and may have pedagogical significance in education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The use of coaching psychology for learning emphasises personal involvement, careful listening, acceptance, empathy and reflection to create a non-threatening and non-judgemental environment where learners feel free to delve into their own experiences and seek answers to their own problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
      <p>Coaching psychologists believe that knowledge needs to be personally appropriated and that this goal can be achieved through a specific type of encounter between the coach and the learners. The responsibility for solving the problems, learning and growing rests with the learners rather than with the coach. Evidence has shown that incorporating coaching psychology into an inquiry-based learning process is beneficial in terms of optimising students’ learning experience; scaffolding the inquiry process; developing positive learning dispositions; and fostering students’ learning relationships, autonomy, self-awareness and learning agency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
      <p>Coaching psychology and PBL differ in various aspects in that one is a sub-discipline in the field of psychology and the other is a learning methodology. For example, coaching psychology considers the qualities and characteristics of coaches from a humanistic perspective, whereas in PBL, tutors’ personal qualities are not considered to be a main factor. However, there are several common threads running through the review of PBL and coaching psychology. Philosophically, they are both grounded in social constructionism, which is concerned with how learners construct new knowledge and build their own mental structures through social interaction with other people and their environment. Theoretically, they both explicitly stress the developmental, situated nature of the learning process and learners’ meaning making and reflection based on their self-directedness and self-determination. In practice, they both emphasise experiential learning, which refers to using an authentic method of achieving understanding through confronting problems and exploring solutions in real learning contexts. Furthermore, they both acknowledge the importance of learning facilitators, i.e., coaches, tutors or mentors, who play an essential role in supporting learners in their own learning and development. Therefore, we posit that PBL and coaching psychology share an affinity in terms of learning facilitation.</p>
      <p>The literature on coaching in PBL is limited, although some researchers have touched on the subject. Barrows and Tamblyn offered their vision of a PBL tutor as a metacognitive coach and mentor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Maudsley noted that the PBL tutor becomes both the steward of the group process and the metacognitive coach by guiding and supporting students’ learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and that PBL tutors are expected to manage increasingly diverse and ambiguous roles defined as mentor, coach, model and guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In addition, it is anticipated that the PBL tutor will function as a group facilitator to support students’ self-directed, active learning and foster critical thinking skills and lifelong learning habits rather than to convey knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The tutor’s role is to coach students only when appropriate to ensure that they make optimal use of the learning opportunities and then withdraw as students develop expertise in the process while continuing to monitor the quality of learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p>
      <p>The nature of PBL is moving towards a <italic>learning design</italic> and <italic>a facilitation system</italic>, which is the core of coaching psychology for learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We believe that a systematic visual representation of the PBL process as a collaborative endeavour between tutors and students can help medical education researchers understand the nature of PBL. This framework should be dependent on the local cultural context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p>
      <p>In the context of Chinese medical education, there are very few studies of PBL within a visualised model clarifying interrelated factors in the process. Liu and his colleagues developed a PBL model that integrates students, tutors and patients in a real clinical context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Zhang constructed a PBL model applicable to basic healthcare education that emphasises the relationship between tutors and students for four modes of learning: guided learning, self-directed learning, inspired learning and motivated learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Huang and his team expanded the application of PBL and explored a ‘P<sup>n</sup>BL model’ involving several elements of clinical practice: Person/People, Problem, Project/Program, Product, Portfolio, Performance and Process. These are good examples of visualised PBL processes in Chinese medical education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, none of these models have the psychological underpinnings that are essential for the learning and facilitation involved in PBL. Additionally, the dynamics between the critical elements of these models are sometimes over-simplified.</p>
      <p>This study aimed to explore a new framework that integrates essential features of current PBL and the perspective of coaching psychology in the wider context of Chinese medical education using a participatory research approach. We expected the integrated framework to be applicable to the PBL process, particularly in PBL tutorial settings. We combined research goals and action goals because they contributed to establishing a learning community and generating valid data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The current study engaged all members equally as co-researchers and enabled the creation, development and modification of a new model for medical education as the result of collective wisdom.</p>

        <title>Research design</title>
        <p>The overall design was informed by participatory research. Participatory research is ‘an orientation to inquiry’ and can be regarded as a methodology that argues in favour of the significance and usefulness of involving research partners in a knowledge-production process that is reflexive, flexible and iterative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Participatory research methods are not fundamentally distinct from other empirical social research approaches and are linked closely to qualitative methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The key element of participatory research is not the methods; rather, it is the attitude of researchers, which in turn determines how, by, and for whom research is conceptualised and conducted. The most important distinction between participatory research and other research methodologies is the location of power at the various stages of the research process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Rooted in common principles of action research and participatory action research, participatory research emphasises listening, observing, feedback, interaction and open dialogue to establish a non-hierarchical learning community that assumes a reciprocity of influence. Through a process of mutual learning that takes place throughout the research process rather than at distinct stages, participants are included in the research as owners of their own knowledge and empowered to take action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In our study, the application of participatory methodologies was collaborative and consultative in practice. We regarded participants as agents and active contributors rather than research subjects and as capable of identifying their own problems, analysing their own situation and designing their own solutions. The role of researchers was modified from directors to facilitators or catalysts. First, spaces where participants could be empowered to engage in the research process were created. Then, there was movement towards relinquishing control and developing participants’ ownership of the research question and the information that was generated, analysed, represented and acted upon in the future.</p>

        <title>Participants</title>
        <p>Four educational psychology researchers and ten participants from a medical school in East China participated in the research. Participants included four second-year medical students (two females and two males) who nearly finished their first PBL module at the medical school, four final-year medical students (three females and one male) who finished a series of PBL modules during their university education and two Respiratory doctors (one female and one male) who were professionally trained as accredited PBL tutors with a minimum of three years of PBL experience. They participated in the research voluntarily and completed the entire research process. The participants were each given 500 RMB as compensation for their time and efforts.</p>

        <title>Research programme</title>
        <p>The research programme consisted of four workshops held from October 2014 to January 2015. The first workshop began with an introductory session on the research framework, followed by a discussion of the current PBL curriculum in the medical school and the main concepts of coaching psychology. In the second workshop, we explored the fit between the adoption of coaching psychology and PBL, blended features of coaching into a PBL curriculum and developed draft models. The third workshop focused on investigating the advantages and the limitations of the draft models, advancing the discussion towards a more integrated model and practicing essential coaching skills and techniques. The final workshop concentrated on modifying and refining the integrated model and ended with implementation plans. During the discussions in the workshops, the research team and the participants were divided into two groups, each with a mix of students, tutors and research team members. Key learning points were summarised at the end of each workshop to aid personal reflection, provide continuity and guide participants towards the next workshop.</p>
        <p>At the end of the research programme, participants were asked to provide feedback on the workshops. The feedback was generally very positive; participants reported a better understanding of PBL and coaching psychology, mastery of coaching skills and techniques and increased confidence in the implementation of the new model. The participants stated that they were highly engaged and motivated in the group discussion and collaborative creation of the model and felt as though they were creative and energetic. They reported that the participatory research approach provided a friendly, open and safe learning environment that allowed them to share opinions and challenged them to engage in deep thinking.</p>

        <title>Ethical considerations</title>
        <p>The research protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of East China Normal University and Tongji University. All participants completed informed consent forms that included an introduction of the overall programme and explanations of the commitment involved in participation. All participants were reassured of the confidentiality of the data and that their course evaluations would not be impacted if they chose to withdraw from the study. It was acknowledged that in small-scale and highly specific participatory research, it might be difficult to protect individuals’ identity. To address this concern, all members of the group signed a confidentiality agreement.</p>

        <title>Data collection</title>
        <p>Data were primarily collected through qualitative methods. We video-recorded our participatory observation of the participants’ conversations, behaviours and interactional patterns in each workshop. We conducted and video-recorded four focus groups and eight semi-structured interviews and collected participants’ notes, posters, PPT and other relevant documents. These methods were complemented by the collection of some descriptive quantitative data gathered from the evaluation forms at the end of the programme. Of note, some of the data collection and analysis processes were interactive and continuous in a spiral form that enabled us to reflect on the previous analytical results and alter actions in the next phase of data collection.</p>

        <title>Data analysis</title>
        <p>The data analysis process was inspired by Glaser and Strauss’ grounded theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and Braun and Clark’s thematic analysis method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] with the purpose of developing a model. The researchers independently coded interviews, documents and observational data after each workshop; performed thematic content analysis; discussed disagreement; and reached consensus on the overall analysis. We then sent our preliminary findings to the participants, invited them to offer their opinions and made the feedback sessions an integral part of the data analysis process. The model was drafted, discussed, modified and shared with the participants. In this way, we not only triangulated the sources and methods of data analysis but also deepened our understanding as researchers through the diversity of our opinions and experiences.</p>

        <title>The relationships and roles of tutors and students</title>
        <p>The tutor-student relationships were found to be interactive and multi-faceted. Generally, the nature of the relationships varied depending on <italic>tasks</italic> or <italic>activities</italic> that tutors and students undertook. The activities further defined the <italic>roles</italic> and <italic>responsibilities</italic> that both parties should take during the learning process. The main tutor-student interactions included mutual feedback, facilitation and understanding. Tutors functioned as teachers in a more traditional sense when they provided direct instruction to the students.<disp-quote><p><italic>My tutors were just like normal teachers when they were offering direct guidance, answering questions and summarising problems that we presented (S1).</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
        <p>Meanwhile, comments on tutors’ indirect roles described them as ‘supporters’, ‘mentors’, ‘coaches’, ‘facilitators’, ‘participants’ and ‘friends’.<disp-quote><p><italic>We can be many different roles when we indirectly support the students, such as coaches, co-workers, friends, mentors, especially in clinical experience, and so on (T2).</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
        <p>The tutors embraced the PBL philosophy and acknowledged that they were co-learners with the students.<disp-quote><p><italic>I like PBL a lot…I think we (tutors) are the same as students in learning. We learn together basically (T1).</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
        <p>The students’ roles varied based on their individual differences, level of participation and group interaction. The students adopted roles as explorers, knowledge seekers, problem solvers, inquirers and presenters working in a team.<disp-quote><p><italic>We have many different roles in PBL… we need to find knowledge by ourselves rather than waiting for the tutors to tell us; we need to ask questions and come up with problems to be solved; we need to search for information and make PPT; we need to present in front of other students and the tutors. But, we all have different roles sometimes because we are all good at different things. Some of us are more talkative, more capable of finding out information… So, we do different things but we put everything together and work as a team (S4).</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec12">
        <title>Student group dynamics</title>
        <p>The evidence regarding student group dynamics was gathered from conversations and non-verbal behaviours in observations. The diversity (e.g., gender, educational background, personal characteristics) of individual members contributed greatly to the advancement of the participatory learning process and creativity of actions. Group members might change their perspectives on what it meant to work together towards a goal and change their understanding of their learning relationships with each other.<disp-quote><p><italic>I used to think that working together is like searching for information and put them together… But, we are still working on our own. Now, I feel we have the same goal and we want to produce the whole thing altogether. We work more closely and we have a kind of teamwork-based relationship that feels different than before (S2).</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
        <p>When drafting the models, the students were collaborative and friendly to each other and concerned with the protection of their products. We noticed that only one student was dissatisfied with the draft model created in his group and, thus, provided an individual draft; he was encouraged by the tutors to express his thoughts to his group members and join in the collaborative work.</p>
        <p>The tutors functioned as group facilitators to manage group dynamics and discussions. They also participated in drafting the model by sharing their experience of PBL tutoring and highlighting the critical elements that should be included in the model.</p>

        <title>Development of self-directed and self-regulated learning</title>
        <p>Participants agreed that the students should develop self-directed and self-regulated learning ability, be responsible for their own learning and actively participate in the process of knowledge construction and meaning making. When students applied self-directedness and self-regulation, they developed identities as learners with ownership over what they had learned and a sense of agency in terms of how they learn.<disp-quote><p><italic>Learning is basically our own thing… We are taking responsibility for learning, and it is our choice to become a professional doctor in the future (S3).</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>I think the students are getting a greater sense that they are the agents in learning. Through this (research programme), they become quite active in asking questions, drawing models, and so on. They may apply that to PBL lessons too (T1).</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
        <p>Some participants mentioned that their experience involved a problem of role conflict with deeply ingrained habits that they had developed through more familiar classroom experiences in which they were passive recipients of knowledge and rules in clinical practice. They reported that PBL presented challenges that allowed them to become intrinsically motivated, set goals, plan a course of action, select appropriate strategies, and self-monitor and self-evaluate their learning.<disp-quote><p><italic>I feel that being more self-regulated is important in the PBL course but not in other kinds of courses. We are used to sitting in big lectures since primary school and secondary school and listening to teachers. I have the habit of listening to teachers… With PBL, you can’t just listen, you need to work by yourself (S4).</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
        <p>Tutors were responsible for initiating a positive learning environment that embraced, encouraged and fostered effective self-directed learning. Tutors were encouraged to implement the PBL philosophy as soon as possible, cultivate positive learning dispositions and higher-order learning skills and develop a healthy expectation of students.<disp-quote><p><italic>Tutors should create a good learning environment for us in the first place so that discussion can happen. Sometimes I don’t know whether I can talk because I am not sure about the tutors’ attitudes (S2).</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>I think tutors can spend some time talking about PBL, what it is, how it works, etc. We are unfamiliar with it at the beginning… And also we want to know what they really want to see in us (S1).</italic></p></disp-quote></p>

        <title>Coaching in PBL facilitation</title>
        <p>The participants showed a great interest in coaching psychology theories, concepts, models, skills and techniques. They agreed that explicitly and intentionally adopting a coaching psychology perspective helped to clarify the tutors’ roles and processes in PBL facilitation.<disp-quote><p><italic>The underlying philosophy and principles of PBL and coaching psychology are basically almost the same… Being a coach is essentially similar to what PBL tutors usually are. I play different roles at different times and on different occasions (T1).</italic></p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p><italic>The knowledge of coaching psychology extends the understanding of PBL learning and facilitation (T2).</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
        <p>Coaching psychology was reported to help the participants both personally and professionally.<disp-quote><p><italic>It (coaching psychology) helps me to communicate better during group work, pay attention to details in conversations in daily life and with patients when I become a doctor in the future (S3).</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
        <p>In addition, the participants actively generated ways to employ coaching skills and techniques in various settings such as flexible usage of open and closed questions, empathetic listening, positive feedback, perspective taking, etc.<disp-quote><p><italic>We can use them (coaching skills) when talking with patients, listening to their problems, listening to our colleagues, answering their (the patients’) questions in a more sensitive and appropriate way, understanding their situations and imagining how we would feel if we were the patients (S2).</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
        <p>Paradoxically, the students claimed that although coaching is beneficial, they still prefer some didactic learning alongside the opportunity to exercise critical thinking.<disp-quote><p><italic>I think tutors’ teaching is still quite important because we cannot find everything in the right way… Sometimes we waste a lot of time and do a presentation but actually miss a lot of points. When tutors talk and summarise later, we find it very helpful… Definitely the tutors need to tell us about theories and basic knowledge. But, we can challenge the tutors and question the knowledge… it shows that we are actively thinking rather than just taking in everything they say (S1).</italic></p></disp-quote></p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, the participants discovered the meaning of coaching psychology and PBL experience, inquired about the roots of the preconceptions of PBL problems in Chinese medical education and formulated a new pedagogical framework through a series of democratic and transformative meaning-making processes. This unorthodox approach fundamentally changed the role of participants from subjects of psychological studies to co-owners of the research process and product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In the discussion, we illustrate the model integrating PBL and coaching psychology, the C + PBL Model, as the main product of the research programme.</p>
      <p>The model shares some common key elements of PBL with other established models that we have reviewed. However, the model that emerged from the data has a number of innovative aspects, particularly in the Chinese medical educational context, and it appears to reflect a general, comprehensive approach rather than merely a tutorial process. There are a number of contributions that coaching psychology brings to the existing PBL approach, as indicated by the C + PBL model.</p>
      <p>We explicitly address the following four points: i) the new model regards empathy and medical humanity as one of the key learning goals in PBL tutorials; ii) it emphasises not only the cognitive scaffolding mentioned in the earlier PBL studies but also the emotional scaffolding overlooked by previous studies; iii) it recognises the multiplicity of roles that tutors adopt during the PBL tutorial and gives more weight to the balance between the roles of knowledge experts and academic coaches; and, finally, iv) it addresses mutual feedback and communication between tutors and students in a democratic, collaborative learning environment.</p>
      <p>These ideas may not be entirely new and have been covered in some specific PBL approaches adopted in various institutions. However, our research results and the feedback from the participants highlighted that Chinese medical tutors and administrative committees in the medical schools have not paid much attention to these points or have done so only at a superficial level. We make strong claims that these four points are essential for supporting medical students’ and tutors’ personal and professional development.</p>
      <sec id="Sec16">
        <title>Description of the C + PBL Model</title>
        <p>The C + PBL Model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) consists of three phases: Preparation, Process, and Conclusion, which lead to the next learning cycle. We propose that dynamic, reciprocal interconnections exist among students, tutors, PBL activities and learning goals. Given the nature of these relationships, each phase of PBL represents opportunities for both students and tutors to develop specific learning capacities. Therefore, the model describes a structure by which students and tutors can focus their efforts on achieving learning goals through a series of learning and facilitating activities.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The C + PBL Model integrating PBL and coaching psychology</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12909_2015_516_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
        <p><italic>The Learning Goals</italic> are as follows: 1) lifelong learning capacities, such as collaborative learning ability, communication ability, leadership, creativity, resilience, etc.; 2) reasoning and problem solving, including the abilities of understanding symptoms, identifying problems, managing knowledge and information and actively seeking solutions, which are particularly applicable to clinical settings; 3) empathy and humanistic concern, which involve demonstrating person-centred attention and warmth, responding to individual patients’ needs, being authentic and congruent in professional work and managing communication and ethical issues with the patients and their families.</p>
        <p><italic>The Student and Tutor circles</italic> are presented by broken lines that indicate that there are no barriers between students, tutors and the wider educational context. PBL activities performed by students and tutors have mutual influence. The Tutor circle seems to wrap the Student circle, representing that a tutor should facilitate and support the development of students while both groups aim to achieve learning goals. A tutor always metaphorically ‘embraces’ students, who are encouraged to take responsibility for and develop ownership of the PBL process.</p>
        <p><italic>The Preparation Phase</italic> enables students and tutors to complete necessary PBL launch tasks. It first requires the course team to redesign the PBL curriculum by radically changing the content and providing a staff development programme that introduces tutors to the messages of coaching psychology and PBL. In this phase, the tutor should initiate certain activities, including designing cases; providing a supportive learning environment; identifying and preparing necessary learning resources, including technical arrangement; and understanding students’ level of learning and, ideally, their individual background. Students’ activities include developing positive attitudes and a sense of preparedness for learning, building on prior knowledge that will serve as the basis of further intellectual development and allocating roles in learning groups.</p>
        <p><italic>The Process Phase</italic> includes students’ iterative cycle of raising and answering questions, managing information and making meaning from it, collaborating and discussing the problems. These activities should be conducted while tutors provide appropriate scaffolding and guidance, monitor the process towards the goals, manage group dynamics, listen to students’ voices and observe students’ performance. In this phase, students engage in complex learning tasks and explore their own path to solving the problems. To support students through this phase, the tutor plays the roles of coach and group facilitator<italic>.</italic> These two roles indicate the important incorporation of coaching psychology. The coaching role consists of scaffolding the learning process by using various learning materials, intentionally eliciting students’ articulation of thoughts and reasoning, modelling higher-order cognitive skills, using group coaching techniques to ensure students’ active participation in discussions and linking the collective activities to the learning goals.</p>
        <p>During <italic>the Conclusion Phase</italic>, the students share their solutions; discuss their rationale and present their learning outcomes (typically in the form of a presentation); reflect on the new knowledge, conceptual understanding and overall learning experience; conduct peer- and self-assessment; and provide suggestions for improving the PBL curriculum in relation to the learning goals and expectations. In this phase, the tutor’s role is to conduct comprehensive assessments (both summative and formative) of students’ performance, provide positive and encouraging feedback, summarise the key learning points and reflect on what has been working well and what might be done differently in the future. It is important to note that although this phase starts with students’ learning performance and assessment, it focuses on on-going reflection and feedback, which are critical in shaping future course of actions.</p>

      <sec id="Sec17">
        <title>Empathy as a key learning goal</title>
        <p>The C + PBL model explicitly considers empathy and humanistic concerns as one of the learning goals in medical education. Empathy is recognised as a central element in achieving positive health care outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and as a professional skill that a ‘good doctor’ possesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Nevertheless, the display of empathy is not consonant with Chinese medical education. According to our review of Chinese medical PBL curricula, the development of empathy is not explicitly included in any of these curricula. In this model, we adopt a three-factor model of medical empathy that consists of ‘perspective taking’, ‘compassionate care’ and ‘standing in the patient’s shoes’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. We add ‘skilful communication’ as the fourth factor because the three factors listed above are expressed through effective communication between doctors and patients. We believe that empathy cannot be directly <italic>taught</italic> in the classroom. Rather, empathy could be <italic>coached</italic> in a learner-centred, non-didactic way. One phenomenological inquiry on empathy suggested that one way to enhance medical students’ empathetic skills is to model these skills during medical school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. By displaying a willingness to listen, connect, care and engage in other empathetic behaviours towards students, the tutor could make coaching a role-modelling process that leads to students’ awareness of building rapport with patients and satisfying their psychological and affective needs in clinical practice. In addition, students should be given time and space to observe, acquire and demonstrate an empathetic disposition. However, it might be difficult to assess empathy because structured clinical examinations typically do not provide a wealth of opportunities to develop empathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. We will return to the issue of evaluation later in this paper.</p>

        <title>Authentic learning experience</title>
        <p>An <italic>authentic learning experience</italic> is highly valued and promoted in this framework. Authenticity is connected with its dynamic and educative character as well as its capacity to promote inquiry skills, provide a sense of freedom and form a self-directive purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In addition, the authentic problem-solving experience is embedded in meaningful contexts because real-world practice is more suffused with complex and ill-structured problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The authentic experience should be defined and owned by the students. The tutor could enhance this experience by preparing an appropriate problem scenario, allowing students’ to have a voice and choice in conducting the inquiry strategically, understanding each student’s learning needs, facilitating dialogues among small groups, stimulating students to integrate new learning content with previous knowledge and encouraging students to step out of their comfort zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>

        <title>Three modes in learning-centred coaching</title>
        <p>The C + PBL model indicates a learning-centred coaching process that is similar to what Gyori called a ‘three-mode process of mentorship’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. It consists of bottom-up (modelling and scaffolding), lateral (collaborating and engaging) and top-down (organising and supervising) processes for sharing autonomy and participating in deep learning. Regarding the bottom-up process, the tutor needs to demonstrate how to perform clinical problem solving through behaviour modelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] and scaffold the learning tasks to foster students’ metacognitive capabilities. The lateral process allows co-learning between the tutor and the students to emerge organically in a highly collaborative environment. The top-down process concerns promoting students’ self-directed learning to generate more questions, reach for the answers and discover the answers through a process of systematic inquiry as well as maintaining important professional standards. These three processes are interrelated in the model; for instance, when working with students, the tutor models effective collaboration and simultaneously supervises the process of collaboration in which they are participating.</p>

        <title>The tutor as a knowledge expert and group facilitator</title>
        <p>This model emphasises that the tutor needs to act as a coach, playing a balanced role as an expert in both the subject matter and in facilitating students’ learning process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The tutor should demonstrate social congruence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] to communicate informally and empathetically with students, create a learning environment that encourages the open exchange of thoughts and, thus, directly affect group functioning and student achievement. It is found that tutors with subject content expertise are more inclined to play a directive role in the tutorial process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Although content experts have positive effects on student learning, it may be beneficial for these experts to develop knowledge of when and how to use this expertise to facilitate learning. Most Chinese PBL tutors are doctors or clinicians in a specific area. They are content experts in certain fields but have very limited facilitation and coaching skills training. Therefore, the development of a broad range of strategies, including coaching, to stimulate student learning and encourage optimal group functioning should be a major focus of tutor recruitment and training.</p>

      <sec id="Sec21">
        <title>Cognitive and emotional scaffolding</title>
        <p>To successfully apply the C + PBL Model, the tutor should acquire the basic attitudes, beliefs, characteristics and skills necessary for any PBL curriculum, such as supporting metacognitive development and strategic and reflective questioning; modulating the level of challenge of the learning to meet student requirements; and monitoring students’ educational progress and group dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. In addition, <italic>cognitive and emotional scaffolding</italic> is at the heart of coaching psychology for learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Scaffolding refers to the temporary support provided to learners (by another person who might be more capable) to complete a task that they would not be able to complete independently and to facilitate the learners’ zone of proximal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Scaffolding should be gradually withdrawn as the students become increasingly competent and responsible for their own learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>].</p>
        <p>From a cognitive perspective, students need to integrate, possess and apply a large amount of domain knowledge during the problem-solving process; thus, students’ cognitive loads are expected to increase over the course of PBL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Cognitive scaffolding can reduce cognitive loads by transforming difficult and complex problems into more manageable and accessible tasks, providing predictable ways to move through activity structures, restricting the options available to the learners and setting social norms for participation and the use of resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Moreover, cognitive scaffolding helps students acquire disciplinary ways of thinking and acting, supports mindful and productive engagement with the learning process, models questions that students need to be asking themselves, provides a framework for students to construct knowledge independently, offers explanations when needed and problematizes important aspects of students’ work to force them to engage with key disciplinary frameworks and strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. It is associated with coaching dialogues for assessing the level of students’ thinking and moving it through a systematic series of questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].</p>
        <p>Emotional scaffolding is important for guiding students through the frustration, lack of confidence, emotional issues and teamwork problems that they might experience during PBL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. There is a focus on the nondirective facilitation of emotional scaffolding regarding self-determination and actualisation tendency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. The students involved in PBL are considered the experts on their own affective needs, and the tutor is considered an expert only on maintaining the attitudinal conditions and managing rapport in the relationship with the students rather than an expert on the students or how the students should learn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Emotional scaffolding includes being a friend, a colleague, a mentor, a coach, a role model or a counsellor to the students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. The tutor’s responsibility is to use active and empathetic listening, understand students’ available educational and social backgrounds, respect and value students’ viewpoints with a non-judgemental attitude, demonstrate outstanding communication skills and hold beliefs consistent with the humanistic approach.</p>
        <p>Due to the complex and multi-skilled nature of scaffolding, some tutors are unsure of how to determine the appropriate time to intervene and how the balance between too much and too little structure with each unique PBL group. Successful scaffolding is largely dependent on the availability and skills of tutors who know when and how to adopt facilitation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. The desirable attributes, skills and strategies commonly used in personal and professional coaching include providing feedback, using open or closed questions, eliciting students’ explanations, elaborating students’ thinking, and supporting students’ reflection and expression of their thoughts and feelings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>].</p>

      <sec id="Sec22">
        <title>Mutual feedback between the tutor and the students</title>
        <p>The C + PBL Model emphasises mutual feedback between the tutor and the students. The on-going feedback can be categorised into two types: specific feedback and general feedback. Specific feedback refers to asking questions to prompt thinking instead of providing direct guidance or correcting errors, offering suggestions and pointing the students to a specific resource for additional information about certain concepts. This kind of feedback requires the tutor to observe students’ level of understanding and respond accordingly in a student-centred environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. General feedback needs to be non-threatening and mastery-oriented to enhance self-directed learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>], a sense of agency and ownership over learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. This type of feedback is provided to empower students with intellectual responsibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>] and improve their self-efficacy beliefs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. The students could evaluate the tutor’s performance but such evaluation should be carried out with caution because less experienced tutors may engage in behaviours aimed at pleasing students. Because the tutor’s and students’ expectations might differ, the tutor’s roles and duties must be made explicit to both parties from the outset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Feedback cannot be given without mutual trust between the tutor and students; therefore, it is important to establish rapport and connection at the beginning of the process and to maintain this trust throughout the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>].</p>

        <title>The challenges of the new framework</title>
        <p>The main challenges of the new framework involve implementation and evaluation issues. Although the participants felt confident in the successful implementation of the model, incorporating it into the existing medical educational system is a great challenge that correlates, to some extent, with reported difficulties (e.g., too time-consuming, lack of staff, students might feel compulsion) in implementing PBL in Asian countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Additional challenges in the implementation include building a solid knowledge base of coaching psychology, PBL and clinical practice; creating a nurturing and supporting culture using coaching principles; and enhancing students’ self-directed learning and tutors’ continuous professional development using coaching strategies. Implementing the model could be a daunting task requiring strong support from academic administrators, well-trained and committed tutors, skilful and dedicated case writers, appropriate technical support and well-prepared students with a belief in the PBL philosophy.</p>
        <p>The alignment between learning activities and assessments is crucial for participation in PBL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Whether the fusion of coaching psychology and PBL is effective is a big question, and we need to find evidence from various aspects to view a whole picture. The learning dispositions, reasoning and problem-solving skills, and empathy that we expect students to develop are long-term learning goals and very difficult to measure. Therefore, obtaining academic or attainment results in the traditional sense is not applicable, and simple quantitative measurements could be flawed. We propose a mixed-methods approach to evaluation that comprises both quantitative and qualitative data (classroom observations, interviews, peer-assessment, narratives and learning portfolios) to give a comprehensive picture of the effectiveness of the new model.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>This article describes the process of developing a new framework integrating features of PBL and the perspective of coaching psychology through a participatory research approach within the context of Chinese medical education. It attempts to develop a systematic model that leads to more efficient, satisfying and long-lasting professional capacities that increase throughout the effective PBL tutorial process. We have successfully fulfilled the aim by presenting the following strengths. The participatory and dialogic research approach offered the participants opportunities to be creative, collaborate and take personal responsibility and, in many ways, resembled some of the features of their professional clinic-related practice. The triangulation of data collected from observations, focus groups, interviews and documents as well as the independent coding during data analysis enhanced the credibility and trustworthiness of the research. In this paper, we provide a rich description of an integrated model of PBL and coaching psychology. The C + PBL Model differs from the current PBL approach in that it explicitly addresses empathy and medical humanity as one of key learning goals in medical education, the tutors’ roles as knowledge experts and learning coaches for the students, cognitive and emotional scaffolding strongly grounded in psychological theories and effective mutual feedback between the tutors and students. Although it is in its infancy, the new model could be regarded as giving a sense of achievement and direction for further implementation. We anticipate that our investigations are useful in two ways. First, the C + PBL Model could serve to stimulate consideration and debate as institutions develop their own PBL concepts and procedures. Second, our study provides insights into incorporating coaching skills into professional development programmes for PBL tutors and PBL curricula for students.</p>
      <p>In addition to its strengths and contributions, our study is subject to several limitations. A comparatively small group of medical students and tutors participated in the research programme; thus, the findings might not be generalisable to other research fields. The participatory research workshops generated a large amount and diversity of data that might be overwhelming to analyse. The third limitation was the restricted resources and time and participants’ different agendas, which made it difficult for us to include all the participants in the final data analysis stage. However, the research could be seen as one part of a collective, on-going learning journey and we would use the feedback from the participants to improve the research programme in the future.</p>
      <p>An important next step of this study is to closely investigate the process of how tutors and students incorporate the framework into their learning using real clinical cases, ideally comparing a group that adopts the C + PBL Model with a group that follows a traditional PBL curriculum. A fine-grained examination of the process of each phase of the model, with video analysis documenting tutors’ interventions and students’ responses, thematic analysis of contextually designed questions and statistical analysis of measurements on the development of learning dispositions and capabilities, is needed. This topic deserves substantial attention and continuous efforts to advance the PBL approach in Chinese medical education.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>To compare the effects of nateglinide and rosiglitazone on inflammatory markers, GLP-1 levels and metabolic profile in patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>A prospective study was performed in 20 patients with DM2, mean age 51.82 ± 8.05 years, previously treated with dietary intervention. Participants were randomized into rosiglitazone (4–8 mg/day) or nateglinide (120 mg 3 times a day) therapy. After 4 months, the patients were crossed-over with 8 weeks washout period to the alternative treatment for an additional 4-month period on similar dosage schedule. The following variables were assessed before and after 4 months of each treatment period: (1) a test with a standardized 500 calories meal for 5 h including frequent measurements of glucose, insulin, glucagon, proinsulin, GLP-1, free fat acids (FFA), and triglycerides levels was obtained. The lipid profile and HbA1 levels were measured at fasting. (2) Haemostatic and inflammatory markers: platelet aggregation, fibrinogen, PAI-1 activity, C reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, TNF-α, leptin, sICAM and TGFβ levels.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Both therapy decreased blood glucose levels under the postprandial curve but neither affected glucagon and GLP-1 levels. Nateglinide was associated with higher insulin and pro-insulin secretion, but similar pro-insulin/insulin ratio when compared with rosiglitazone. Only rosiglitazone decreased Homa β, PAI-1 activity, CRP, fibrinogen, TGFβ, FFA and triglyceride levels.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Nateglinide and rosiglitazone were effective in improving glucose and lipid profile and β cell function, but rosiglitazone afforded a better anti-inflammatory effect. No drug restored alpha cell sensitivity or changed GLP-1 levels. Maintenance of haemostatic factors, inflammatory factors and glucagon levels can be related to the continuously worsening of cardiovascular function and glucose control observed in DM2.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The rigorous control of glycemia can delay but not prevent vascular complications, which are probably related to many other poorly controlled atherogenic factors, such as obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, accelerated aging, disturbances in coagulation and fibrinolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although metformin has been confirmed as the first line option to treat diabetes, troublesome gastrointestinal intolerance sometimes precludes its use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>Rosiglitazone and nateglinide are drugs that differ in their primary mechanism of action and have been previously considered in type 2 diabetes treatment.</p>
      <p>The thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist, is an insulin sensitizing agent that improves glycaemic control and a variety of other metabolic disturbances in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, besides weight gain, it promoted fluid retention and heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The increased risk of acute myocardial infarction and a trend towards increased mortality with the drug brought concern about the safety of rosiglitazone, prompting its withdrawn of the market.</p>
      <p>Another alternative option to therapy can be the insulin secretagogue nateglinide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] that is a derivative of phenylalanine and structurally distinct of sulphonylureas, which also had raised concern over their potential adverse effects in the event of ischemic heart disease. Nateglinide’s interaction with sulpnhonylurea receptor (SUR1), a subunit of the ATP sensitive potassion channel (K<sub>ATP</sub>) on plasma membrane is fleeting, favoring a rapid onset and short duration of insulin secretion, providing post-prandial glucose control with less hypoglycemia and weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The promotion of glucagon like peptide 1-(GLP-1) release from intestinal L cells may be another important mechanism by which nateglinide restores early-phase insulin secretion and regulates postprandial glucose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, this effect could be due to improvement in glucose levels and deserves confirmation.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, nateglinide has little binding to the vascular muscle and cardiac SUR2 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] suggesting that it could be a good and safe option to new diagnosed type 2 diabetes. However there are few and contradictory reports of nateglinide effects on cardiovascular function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and inflammatory markers, many of them comparing nateglinide to placebo, difficulting to separate the impact of improvement of glucose control on the obtained results. Also, the influence of nateglinide on glucagon secretion is poorly known.</p>
      <p>To the best knowledge of nateglinide effects we conducted this study comparing the effects of nateglinide with rosiglitazone on glucose and lipid profile, but also on several parameters still not well characterized like pancreatic alpha and beta cells response to diet, the incretin hormone GLP-1, inflammatory markers, and haemostatic factors. The purpose of the current study was also to ascertain whether anti-diabetic agents with different primary mechanisms of action targeting the two main pathophysiological defects of type 2 diabetes would have different effects on these parameters and if they were independent of glucose control.</p>

The rosiglitazone dosage was titrated in order to achieve fasting glucose levels lower than 7.0 mmol/L using domiciliary capillary glucose measurements. Nateglinide was administrated in a fixed dose three times a day. After 4 months, the patients were crossed-over after 8-week washout period to the alternative treatment for an additional 4-month period on a similar dosage schedule. Subjects were followed on an outpatient basis every 1–2 weeks for drug and weight-maintaining diet adjustments throughout the study period. The clinical characteristics of the patients are depicted in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. At the time of entry, a complete history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation including urinalysis, renal, hepatic and thyroid function tests, serum lipid and electrolytes levels and ECG were obtained for all subjects. None of the patients exercised on a regular basis. Exclusion criteria included any severe concomitant illness, uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure &gt; 190 × 120 mmHg), marked dyslipidemia and use of hypolipemic and anticoagulant medications. No subjects had any acute concurrent illness.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinical and biochemical characteristics of 20 patients with type 2 diabetes at baseline and after 4 months of nateglinide or rosiglitazone therapy</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="3">Variables</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="2">Baseline</th><th align="left" colspan="2">Nateglinide</th><th align="left" rowspan="3">p</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="2">Baseline</th><th align="left" colspan="2">Rosiglitazone</th><th align="left" rowspan="3">p</th></tr><tr><th align="left" colspan="2">After 4 months</th><th align="left" colspan="2">After 4 months</th></tr><tr><th align="left">Median</th><th align="left">(25th–75th)</th><th align="left">Median</th><th align="left">(25th–75th)</th><th align="left">Median</th><th align="left">(25th–75th)</th><th align="left">Median</th><th align="left">(25th–75th)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Body weight (kg)</td><td char="." align="char">67.9</td><td align="left">(64.1–81.0)</td><td char="." align="char">70.0</td><td align="left">(64.5–78.0)</td><td char="." align="char">0.073</td><td char="." align="char">69.0</td><td align="left">(63.9–77.0)</td><td char="." align="char">68.9</td><td align="left">63.6–77.9</td><td char="." align="char">0.984</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hba1c (%)</td><td char="." align="char">7.45</td><td align="left">(7.0–8.3)</td><td char="." align="char">6.65</td><td align="left">(5.7–7.8)</td><td char="." align="char">

        <p>The patients were instructed to follow similar food intake and to abstain from use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee and any physical activity 24-h before the test days. The following procedures were performed before (basal values) and after each 4 months treatment period (nateglinide or rosiglitazone groups): (1) hormonal and metabolic determinations: a test with a standardized 500-kcal mixed breakfast tolerance test (60 % carbohydrate, 20 % fat and 20 % protein) for 5 h including frequent plasma or serum measurements (at times 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 min) of glucose, insulin, glucagon, proinsulin, GLP-1, free fat acids (FFA), and triglycerides levels was performed after 12 h fasting. The fasting lipid profile and HbA<sub>1</sub> levels were also measured. (2) Haemostatic and inflammatory markers: fasting blood fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) activity, C reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNFα), leptin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM), transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) levels and platelet aggregation. (3) Cardiovascular evaluation: 24-h blood pressure monitoring.</p>

        <p>Glucose levels were determined by the glucose oxidase/peroxidase method (Labtest, São Paulo, Brazil) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by HPLC (National Glyco Hemoglobin Standardization Program, USA. Triglyceride levels were measured by the lipase/glycerol kinase method (Labtest, São Paulo, Brazil) and total cholesterol (total-C) by the cholesterol oxidase/peroxidase method. HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) was separated using the phosphotungstic acid/Mg<sup>2+</sup> method and measured by oxidase/peroxidase method. LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) was estimated by Friedewald equation. Free fat acids (FFA) were measured utilizing enzymatic colorimetric method (Wako Chemicals USA, INC). A double-antibody radioimmunoassay was used to measurements of. insulin, proinsulin, glucagon (Linco Research, St. Louis, MO, USA) and total GLP-1 (Millipore Corporation. Billerica, MA) Intra-assay and interassay CVs for hormonal analyses were 6.8 and 9.6 % for insulin; 4.4 and 6.5 % for glucagon; 5 and 5.3 % for proinsulin and &lt;5 % for GLP-1. Circulating levels of Il-6, TNF-α, leptina, sICAM, TGF beta and CRP were measured with high sensitivity ELISA kits (R&amp;D Systems). The samples of each patient were analyzed in the same assay. Intra-assay CV were &lt;8 % for Il-6, TNF-alfa and leptin and &lt;4.5 % for sICAM, TGF-β and CRP.</p>
        <p>Haemostatic factors were measured using the same assay for each patient. Fibrinogen was determined by the CLAUSS method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] with Fibriquick Assay, Sigma, USA. The plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) activitiy was determined by quantitative assays (Chromolize™ PAI-1, Biopool, Umea, Sweden); The intra-assay CVs were 8 and 3.7 %, respectively. Platelet aggregation was also determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
        <p>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) values were assessed by 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring in all patients every 20 min from 8.00 a.m. to midnight, and every 30 min from midnight to 8.00 a.m. in the following day.</p>

        <p>Numerical data were reported as mean and standard deviation or median and percentile. Differences (95 % CI) between treatment groups were initially tested for treatment-time interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and then compared by Mann–Whitney tests. Baseline and post-treatment differences between the nateglinide and rosiglitazone groups were compared by Mann–Whitney tests. Wilcoxon matched pairs tests were performed to compare the differences in clinical and biochemical measurements for each group before and after the four months of therapy. The responses to the standardized 500-kcal mixed breakfast tolerance test were analyzed by the area under the curve using the trapezoidal rule and by Wilcoxon test for every time for the 5 h duration. Graphical representations are as mean and standard error. Statistical analysis was performed using Prisma software (version 10.1, SPSS Inc., Chicago). In all cases a p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

        <p>No treatment period interaction effect was demonstrated; hence the values from each treatment periods were analyzed together. Two patients that started with rosiglitazone did not finished the nateglinide period due to a worsening in diabetes control. The final analysis comprised 20 patients on rosiglitazone and 20 patients on nateglinide.</p>

          <p>There were no significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) in baseline clinical and biochemical measurements of those patients randomized to nateglinide or rosiglitazone (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p>
          <p>HbA1 levels fell (nateglinide-p = 0.032; rosiglitazone-p = 0.036) equally in both treatment groups (p = 0.91). Proportions of patients achieving an endpoint HbA1c of &lt;7 % were similar for nateglinide (60 %) and rosiglitazone (75 %) groups p = 0.5.</p>

          <p>However, there were significant between-treatment difference for the following parameters: rosiglitazone decreased glucose levels significantly at all times of the curve, including fasting, whereas nateglinide decreased mainly the post prandial glucose levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Test with a standardized 500 calories mixed breakfast for 5 h: blood glucose, insulin, proinsulin and glucagon levels. <italic>N1</italic> and <italic>N2</italic> before and after 4 months of nateglinide therapy. <italic>R1</italic> and <italic>R2</italic> before and after 4 months of rosiglitazone therapy. <italic>Hatched area</italic> data of normal controls.

          <p>The initial insulin response to a meal was anticipated and augmented with nateglinide treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Nateglinide also increased the prandial insulin (total and incremental AUC) and pro-insulin (incremental AUC) responses and the insulinogenic index, whereas decreased both glucose/insulin and proinsulin/insulin ratios (total and incremental) Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, rosiglitazone decreased insulin (incremental) and proinsulin (total) AUCs and increased HOMA beta.

      <title>Discussions</title>
      <p>This clinical, prospective, randomized, crossover study compared the effects of two different classes of drugs (rosiglitazone, an insulin sensitizer, and nateglinide, an insulin secretagogue) in type 2 diabetes patient. We evaluated the same patient under basal conditions, i.e., while hyperglycemic without medications, and again after 4 months of treatment with nateglinide or rosiglitazone. The major aims of this strategy was to minimize the influence of metabolic control on the specific drug effect. Despite similar improvements on glucose control, changes on lipid profile, insulin response and inflammatory markers were different with therapies.</p>
      <p>Both treatment groups achieved similar and significant mean decreases from baseline in plasma glucose and fasting HbA1c levels. Proportions of patients achieving an endpoint HbA1c of &lt;7 % were similar for nateglinide and rosiglitazone groups. Initial insulin response to the 5 h standardized 500 calories breakfast was augmented only with nateglinide treatment. The higher insulin and proinsulin levels, observed during nateglinide therapy, are in line with reports of its stimulatory effects on beta cells function, favoring a quick onset and short duration of insulin secretion, contrasting with the rosiglitazone’s sparing effects on beta cells function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As expected, nateglinide anticipated the insulin peak response, improving mainly post-prandial glucose levels whereas rosiglitazone decreased glucose levels significantly at all times of the curve (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Similar results were seen with proinsulin levels during the meal test: increased with nateglinide and decreased with rosiglitazone.</p>
      <p>So, both treatment affected beta cell function. Despite increasing insulin secretion, the pro-insulin/insulin area under the curve ratio during the 5 h of the breakfast decreased during nateglinide treatment, suggesting that it improved previous secretory dysfunction of beta cells, contrasting with the worsening in beta cells function usually reported to sulphonylureas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The increase in insulin secretion could not be accounted for by changes in body weight—it was unaffected in both groups, probably because of the short duration of post prandial insulin secretion during nateglinide therapy, the frequent ambulatory visits and nutritional counseling of the patients. There was no complains of hypoglycemia with both treatments.</p>
      <p>Rosiglitazone also improved beta cells function, attested by the increase in HOMA-B value. Despite causing lower prandial insulin response, rosiglitazone kept total and incremental glucose AUC at similar levels when compared with nateglinide.</p>
      <p>Overall changes on plasma lipids levels were different with therapies. Only rosiglitazone decreased post-prandial FFA and of triglycerides levels, both of which probably accounted to the observed amelioration of beta cell function (HOMA-B) and of insulin resistance, reflecting on the glucose-lowering action of rosiglitazone.</p>
      <p>By the other side, nateglinide decreased fasting cholesterol levels, that were lower than with rosiglitazone treatment (p = 0.04).</p>
      <p>Small changes in lipid metabolism were expected, and previous reports have also been light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The near normal triglyceride and cholesterol levels of our patients prior both therapies was probably a factor influencing these modest results. However, neither the increase in insulin production nor the increase in insulin sensitivity were able to decrease fasting or post-prandial glucagon levels, confirming that both the inherent effects of each drugs, allied to the decrease in gluco and lipotoxicity were insufficient to restore alfa cells sensitivity to glucose and insulin levels, favoring the progression of diabetes.</p>
      <p>Besides improvements on plasma FFA levels and HOMA beta, rosiglitazone treatment decreased CRP, TGF beta and fibrinogen levels and PAI-1 activity. These data suggest drug specific effects, not dependent on amelioration of the metabolic milieu.</p>
      <p>Inflammatory markers and other haemostatic factor (IL-6, TNF alpha, leptin, s-ICAM, platelet aggregation) were unaffected by both treatment, despite the great improvement in glucose profile, Such persistence in inflammation is probably implicated in the poor reduction in cardiovascular disease despite glucose control in type 2 diabetes patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
      <p>No changes were observed in GLP-1 levels during both therapies. A reduced incretin effect is a well-known characteristic of patients with type 2 diabetes. Impaired release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been reported to be at least partly involved in impairment of early-phase insulin secretion after food intake and postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
      <p>High concentrations of several antidiabetic drug classes, namely thiazolidinediones, sulphonylureas, meglitinides and morphilinoguanides have been reported to inhibit the DPP-IV enzyme, being nateglinide the strongest inhibitor. So, besides its effect as a beta-cell K-ATP channel inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], nateglinide was reported to act as a prandial insulin-releasing agent, both by inhibiting GLP-1 degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and by increasing GLP-1 secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] secondary to the increase of intracellular calcium.</p>
      <p>We did not confirm these data in our study.</p>
      <p>There was no change in blood pressure. Nateglinide, probably due to its little binding to the vascular muscle and cardiac SUR2 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], was not expected to change blood pressure levels. Overall assessment of safety demonstrated that both drugs were well tolerated, and there were no significant side effects or severe hypoglycemic episodes.</p>
      <p>Although metformin has been confirmed as the first line option to treat diabetes, troublesome gastrointestinal intolerance sometimes precludes its use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, glinide remains an important adjuvant for recent onset T2D patients. When compared with rosiglitazone, nateglinide achieved similar efficacy in improving glucose control. Although rosiglitazone had a sparing effect on beta cell function and decrease FFA, triglycerides and PAI-1 levels, it was recently excluded from the marked due to an increase in cardiovascular disease. Despite leading to more insulin secretion, nateglinide did not worsen body weight or beta cell function, measured by the pro-insulin/insulin ratio. Long term studies are needed to ascertain whether it can prevent beta cell exhaustion or apoptosis.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>In patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by dietary therapy, nateglinide and rosiglitazone resulted in similar overall improvements in glucose control and beta cell function. In addition, nateglinide reduced total cholesterol levels and rosiglitazone reduced post-prandial FFA and triglycerides levels and some inflammatory markers. Despite different mechanisms of action nether drug changed GLP-1 levels or previous secretory dysfunction of alpha cells. Maintenance of inflammatory markers, haemostatic factors and glucagon levels can be related to the continuously worsening of cardiovascular function and glucose control observed in DM2.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>The disease re-emergence threat from the major malaria vector in Sri Lanka, <italic>Anopheles culicifacies,</italic> is currently increasing. To predict malaria vector dynamics, knowledge of population genetics and gene flow is required, but this information is unavailable for Sri Lanka. This study was carried out to determine the population structure of <italic>An. culicifacies</italic> E in Sri Lanka.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Eight microsatellite markers were used to examine <italic>An. culicifacies</italic> E collected from six sites in Sri Lanka during 2010-2012. Standard population genetic tests and analyses, genetic differentiation, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, linkage disequilibrium, Bayesian cluster analysis, AMOVA, SAMOVA and isolation-by-distance were conducted using five polymorphic loci.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Five microsatellite loci were highly polymorphic with high allelic richness. Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) was significantly rejected for four loci with positive <italic>F</italic><sub>IS</sub> values in the pooled population (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0100). Three loci showed high deviations in all sites except Kataragama, which was in agreement with HWE for all loci except one locus (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0016). Observed heterozygosity was less than the expected values for all sites except Kataragama, where reported negative <italic>F</italic><sub>IS</sub> values indicated a heterozygosity excess. Genetic differentiation was observed for all sampling site pairs and was not supported by the isolation by distance model. Bayesian clustering analysis identified the presence of three sympatric clusters (gene pools) in the studied population. Significant genetic differentiation was detected in cluster pairs with low gene flow and isolation by distance was not detected between clusters. Furthermore, the results suggested the presence of a barrier to gene flow that divided the populations into two parts with the central hill region of Sri Lanka as the dividing line.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Three sympatric clusters were detected among <italic>An. culicifacies</italic> E specimens isolated in Sri Lanka. There was no effect of geographic distance on genetic differentiation and the central mountain ranges in Sri Lanka appeared to be a barrier to gene flow.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p><italic>Anopheles culicifacies</italic> Giles <italic>sensu lato,</italic> the major malaria vector in Sri Lanka, is widely distributed across the dry and intermediate zones of the country (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). <italic>An. culicifacies</italic> is comprised of five morphologically indistinguishable sibling species that were reported in India and provisionally designated as A, B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Species B and E are found in Sri Lanka, where E is the major vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and B is the poor vector. Sympatrically distributed B and E species show variations in insecticide resistance, host feeding preference, longevity and Y-chromosome polymorphism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Map of Sri Lanka showing climatic zones and sample collection sites</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13071_2015_1286_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
      <p>Until recently, <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasite infections caused millions of clinical malaria cases in Sri Lanka that resulted in thousands of deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although malaria control measures in Sri Lanka have reduced the number of reported annual cases to several hundred, imported cases can still occur and thus may create a high risk for disease re-emergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The main malaria control method in Sri Lanka was vector controlling through residual insecticide spraying, which is now less frequent. However, recent research findings show that vector species can tolerate a variety of harsh environmental conditions including salinity and pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, there is a potential for malaria to spread if a <italic>Plasmodium</italic> outbreak occurs.</p>
      <p>The dynamics of malaria vector mosquito populations can be accurately predicted using analyses of population genetic structures and gene flow. Such knowledge would be useful for implementing new strategies to monitor malaria vectors as well as to understand disease epidemiology and the spread of insecticide resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>Microsatellites are highly polymorphic and evolve more rapidly than nuclear or mitochondrial DNA, and thus they are widely used for genetic analyses of different mosquito vectors such as <italic>An. gambiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], <italic>An. sinensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and <italic>An. funestus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In India, microsatellite markers have been isolated and the population genetic structure has analyzed for the <italic>An. culicifacies</italic> sibling species A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, the population genetics of <italic>An. culicifacies</italic> in Sri Lanka have not been studied and only various genetic markers have been used to identify sibling species. Therefore, in this study, microsatellite markers developed to analyze the sibling species A in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] were used to evaluate the genetic structure of <italic>An. culicifacies</italic> E populations in Sri Lanka.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <sec id="Sec3">
        <title>Mosquito samples</title>
        <p>Wild engorged female <italic>An. culicifacies</italic> mosquitoes were collected between January 2010 and December 2012 from six different sites in Sri Lanka: Anuradhapura (8°21’N, 80°23’E), Kandy (7°17’N, 80°38’E), Nikaweratiya (7°43’N, 80°07’E), Thanamalwila (6°25’N, 81°07’E), Monaragala (6°54’N, 81°10’E) and Kataragama (6°40’N, 81°32’E) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Multiple collections at each site were conducted. No collection sites were located in the Northern and Eastern parts of Sri Lanka due to infrequent indoor spraying (IRS) of insecticides arising from 30 years of civil war in these regions. Cytogenetically identified species E mosquitoes were used for microsatellite genotyping.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec4">
        <title>DNA extraction and microsatellite genotyping</title>
        <p>Genomic DNA was extracted from mosquitoes using a phenol:chloroform extraction method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Out of 13 microsatellite loci used in the genetic analysis of species A and B in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], eight loci (AcAIIB5, AcAVB93, AcAVB93A, AcAVIB213, AcAVIIIB40, AcA36, AcA59, AcA75) were selected for this analysis based on PCR amplification of corresponding loci in sibling E. PCR was carried out as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] using forward primers that were labeled with HEX or FAM markers. The PCR products were genotyped (Macrogen Inc., South Korea) and allele scores determined according to the fragment size using Peak Scanner software (Applied Biosystems, USA). A total of 193 individuals were genotyped from six (6) sampling sites (<italic>N</italic> = 29, 33, 32, 36, 31, and 42 for Anuradhapura, Monaragala, Thanamalwila, Kandy, Kataragama and Nikaweratiya, respectively).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec5">
        <title>Genetic analysis</title>
        <p>The genetic analysis was carried out using five polymorphic loci: AcAIIB5, AcAVB93, AcAVIB213, AcA36 and AcA59. The genetic diversity within samples and overall was calculated for each locus by estimating allele frequencies, number of alleles, allele richness and in breeding coefficient (<italic>F</italic><sub>IS</sub>) using FSTAT software v2.9.3.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The presence of null alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] at each locus was calculated with Micro-Checker 2.2.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Genotypic frequencies were tested against the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) within populations using Arlequin v3.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. An unbiased estimate of the <italic>p</italic>-value for each locus was then calculated by exact test using the Markov chain method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], with a forecasted chain length of 1,000,000 steps and dememorization steps of 100,000. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium between all pairs of loci was calculated with Arlequin v3.1 and GENEPOP v4.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. All analyses were performed with 1,000 dememorizations, 100 batches and 1,000 iterations per batch.</p>
        <p>To determine the population substructure, <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> values were calculated followed by overall tests for differentiation using bootstrap-correlated Fisher’s exact tests in FSTAT. Wright’s F-statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] in population pairs using Arlequin v3.1 and the Weir and Cockerham method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] in FSTAT were used to evaluate the level of genetic differentiation between populations. Bonferroni corrections were performed for all tests that involved multiple comparisons.</p>
        <p>The long term effective population size (<italic>Ne</italic>) was estimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] based on the expected heterozygosity at each microsatellite locus assuming a Stepwise Mutation Model (SMM) using the formula <italic>Ne</italic>μ = {[1/(1-<italic>He</italic>)]<sup>2</sup>-1}/8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], where <italic>H</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> is the expected heterozygosity under HWE and ‘μ’ is the microsatellite mutation rate. Proposed mutation rates for <italic>An. gambiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] were used taking into account that the average mutation rate varies little, even between well separated species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. <italic>Ne</italic> estimates were calculated in a relative scale, using the product of <italic>Ne</italic>μ as a proxy of <italic>Ne</italic> for each locality to avoid bias due to incorrect estimation of the mutation rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The effective migration rate between localities (<italic>Nm</italic> values) was estimated using pairwise <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) in Arlequin v3.1 was used to examine genetic variation distributions. The isolation by distance model was used to test for any effect of distance on genetic differentiation. The significance of the regression of genetic differentiations on geographic distance between sample pairs was tested using the Mantel test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] in the IBD software package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], with 100,000 permutations and the regression of <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> /(1-<italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub>) on the natural log (<italic>ln</italic>) of geographic distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) analysis was performed using SAMOVA software v1.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] to investigate the spatial genetic structure and to identify any possible barriers to gene flow between collection sites.</p>
        <p>Bayesian analysis was carried out to identify possible clusters (<italic>K</italic>) within the studied population using STRUCTURE 2.3.4 software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Data sets were used without prior information for the sampling locations and assuming a model wherein allele frequencies were correlated within populations. The admixture model was used that allowed for some mixed ancestry within individuals and α was allowed to vary. Twenty independent runs were performed for each value of <italic>K</italic> (<italic>K</italic> =1 to 10) with a burn-in period of 100,000 iterations and 10,000 steps for Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) replications. The Evanno method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] in the program STRUCTURE HARVESTER v0.6.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] was used to determine the most likely number of clusters. This method includes an <italic>ad hoc</italic> quantity, D<italic>K</italic>, which is based on the second order rate of change of the likelihood function between successive values of <italic>K</italic>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This is the first study to describe the population genetic structure of <italic>An. culicifacies</italic> sibling species E in the complex that consists of three sympatric clusters in Sri Lanka. The microsatellite markers used in this study were isolated from sibling species A in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Among the eight markers that were successfully amplified for species E in Sri Lanka, five (AcAVIIIB40, AcA59, AcAVIB213, AcAIIB5, AcAVB93 and AcAVB93A) were highly polymorphic, and thus useful for exploring the genetic population structure of sibling E in Sri Lanka. These five loci had high allele diversity and expected heterozygosity (&gt;0.60) that resulted in the observed genetic diversity of the study population.</p>
      <p>Out of the eight microsatellite loci used to screen the sibling species E in the current study, six were included in the set of loci used for sibling species A in India (AcAVIIB40, AcA59, AcAVIB213, AcA11B5, AcAVB93 and AcAVB93A). The number of alleles seen in this study varied according to the microsatellite loci studied. Locus AcA59 had the highest number of alleles (14) compared to 8 alleles for the same locus of species A in India. Meanwhile, locus AcAVIB213 had 12 alleles, while the Indian sibling species A had 17. The fewest alleles were seen for locus AcAVB93A in both Sri Lankan E and Indian A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, the allele sizes observed in this study for sibling E were lower than that for sibling A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] in India for five microsatellite loci (AcAVIIIB40, AcA59, AcAVIB213, AcA75, AcAVB93A), while the sizes of the other three loci (AcAVB93; AcA36; AcAIIB5) of species A in India were within the ranges observed for sibling E in Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p>The genetic structure of a sibling species in the <italic>An. culicifacies</italic> complex, given that a study of spatial or Bayesian genetic structure has not been undertaken for any sibling species in the complex. These microsatellite loci have not been physically mapped to <italic>An. culicifacies</italic> polytene chromosomes, and therefore the location of these loci with respect to the polymorphic chromosome forms is unknown. Linkage disequilibrium was detected only within two pairs of loci in the entire population out of ten comparisons as well as in a single pair of loci at all collecting sites, suggesting the absence of significant linkage between loci, which may have a random distribution in the genome.</p>
      <p>Samples isolated from Kataragama site agreed with HWE with excess heterozygosity while all other localities showed significant deviations. The heterozygote deficiency observed at all other sites could be due to the population substructure (Wahlund effect), inbreeding, selection or null alleles. The heterozygote deficiency observed at multiple loci likely was not due to selection, which generally engages only one locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. If inbreeding occurs in the population, heterozygote deficiency would be observed at all loci in a population since inbreeding has a genome-wide effect. The heterozygote deficiency could instead be due to null alleles as result of nucleotide mismatches in the primer annealing regions that lead to non-amplification of corresponding alleles. The population substructure analysis revealed three sympatric clusters in the studied population, but Kataragama was the only location that had excess heterozygosity, consisting of only two clusters while all other sites had a mixture of all three clusters.</p>
      <p>In this study a possible barrier to gene flow was observed in the East-west direction across the central area of the country that was close to the Kandy sampling site, which has one of Sri Lanka’s highest altitudes and is surrounded by a number of hills (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These hills could act as a barrier to gene flow. Furthermore, Anuradhapura and Nikaweratiya are low-altitude areas on one side of the barrier where cluster I predominated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), while Kataragama, Monaragala and Thanamalwila are situated at a low altitude on the other side of the barrier where cluster III was more common. Interestingly, the Kandy population had nearly equal proportions of each cluster.</p>
      <p>The Kataragama site has the lowest altitude and (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) is near the sea and has the driest climate. The other sites were closer to the mountain ranges rather than to the ocean. Therefore, the significant variation in the genetic analysis of <italic>An. culicifacies</italic> E for the Kataragama site relative to the other collection sites could arise from influences by the coastal environment.</p>
      <p>All sample collecting sites had similar topologies as far as breeding sites for <italic>An. culicifacies</italic> E are concerned, although environmental factors such as temperature and humidity might vary among these sites. Therefore, the availability of breeding sites was not expected to influence the gene flow between collection sites. Most of the areas that <italic>An. culicifacies</italic> inhabits experience high amounts of rainfall only in the South West Monsoon season (December to February). During this period, the abundance of mosquitoes falls drastically due to monsoon-driven flushing of egg clutches and larval breeding sites. Thus, mosquito population abundance undergoes seasonal changes with high densities reported only during the dry seasons. The high level of genetic diversity observed in this study suggests that <italic>An. culicifacies</italic> E can maintain a relatively high effective population size despite large population fluctuations.</p>
      <p>Finally, studying insecticide susceptibility and performing parasite susceptibility tests to determine insecticide resistance levels and vectorial capacity of species E in two regions separated by a physical barrier is recommended to provide baseline genetic information about the vector. Such knowledge is useful for implementing new vector control strategies or to revise ongoing national malaria control practices, as well as to drive a re-emergence of malaria prevention programs.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Three sympatric clusters were detected among <italic>An. culicifacies</italic> E specimens collected in Sri Lanka. There was no effect of geographic distance on genetic differentiation in a pairwise population analysis. The central mountain ranges in Sri Lanka appeared to act as a barrier to gene flow.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Rational design of AAV capsids is a simple method for enhancing AAV transduction efficiency. AAV-DJ is a highly recombinogenic hybrid vector created from DNA shuffling of eight AAV serotypes, which mediates efficient gene expression both in vitro and in vivo. AAV2 and AAV8 are the closest parental vectors of AAV-DJ and it has been reported that mutations on the 137/251/503 ubiquitination or phosphorylation sites of the AAV2 or AAV8 capsid lead to dramatic enhancement of gene delivery. Here, we aimed to find out whether the same point mutations on the AAV-DJ capsid could lead to significant improvement for gene delivery both in vitro and in vivo.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>We constructed three single point mutants (K137R/T251A/S503A) of AAV-DJ and the transduction efficiency of these mutants and AAV-DJ were investigated using two reporter gene systems including green fluorescent protein (GFP) and dual-luciferase (Gaussia luciferase and Firefly luciferase). Data indicated that single point mutations T251A/S503A lead to significant improvement of dual-luciferase expression in vivo after tail vein (TV) injection in mice respectively, despite limited enhancement of GFP expression in 293 T, Hela and HepG2 cells in vitro. Moreover, in vivo bioluminescence image and viral genome DNA copy number in tissue analysis showed that these mutants reserved the liver tropism characteristics, consistent with AAV-DJ.</p>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Single point mutations on the 251/503 sites of AAV-DJ capsid can lead to a significant improvement for in vivo gene expression. These enhanced AAV vectors have great potential in gene therapy applications.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) hold great promise in human gene therapy and have been widely used to target liver, muscle, heart, brain, eye, kidney and other tissues in various studies due to its ability to provide long-term gene expression and lack of pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. AAVs belong to the parvovirus family and each contains a single strand DNA flanked by two inverted terminal repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There have been reported at least 12 capsid serotypes of AAV vectors (AAV1 to AAV12) and their unique capsid structures enable them to recognize and transduce different cell types and organs. For instance, AAV2-mediated RPE65 gene transfer conferred safe and efficient improvement in retinal function in Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis patients by subretinal injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. AAV8-mediated hFIX gene transfer by a single peripheral-vein infusion consistently leads to long-term expression of the FIX transgene at therapeutic levels without acute or long-lasting toxicity in patients with severe hemophilia B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>AAV vector possesses many advantages in gene transfer, but there are still some problems to be solved. AAV infection steps include receptor binding, cell entry, intracellular trafficking, uncoating, second-strand synthesis, vector genome stabilization and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The ubiquitin-proteasome degradation machinery has been considered to be a major barrier that negatively affects AAV-mediated gene expression by degrading the viral particles during their intracellular trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Point mutation of surface exposed tyrosine residues of AAV capsid protein was reported as a simple and effective method for evading phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination, leading to higher transduction efficiency both in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There have also been reported that point mutations on the AAV capsid at specific tyrosine, serine, threonine and lysine residues could lead to significant transduction improvement both in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>AAV-DJ is a variant generated from the libraries of AAV hybrids of eight serotypes by DNA shuffling method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is able to efficiently transduce a broad range of cell types in vitro but has specific liver tropism in vivo, like AAV8. Moreover, it possesses more ability to evade immune neutralization and thus can efficiently deliver higher quantities of therapeutic DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Recently, AAV-DJ has been widely used for gene therapy due to its high efficiency in gene transfer. For example, AAV-DJ vector was used to deliver a knockout construct to fetal pig fibroblasts with a higher targeting frequency than the other naturally occurring serotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. AAV-DJ mediated homologous recombination (HR) at high efficiency in human keratinocytes and had been used to correct the LAMA3 locus in primary cells, which was not transduced efficiently by the most commonly used AAV serotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
      <p>To further improve the AAV-DJ vector, our study focused on investigating whether point mutations on the capsid of AAV-DJ can increase its transduction efficiency or broaden the tropism both in vitro and in vivo. AAV2 and AAV8 are the closest parental vectors of AAV-DJ and most of the amino acid residues are similar between the capsids of these three vectors. It has been reported that single point mutation on the T251, T503 site of AAV2 or the K137 site of AAV8 capsid leads to dramatic enhancement of gene delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In the AAV-DJ capsid, lysine (K) and threonine (T) residues are retained at the 137 and 251 positions as they are in the capsid of AAV8 or AAV2. The single point mutation at the T503 residue, which is equivalent to the T505 residue in the AAV-DJ capsid, has been reported to significantly enhance AAV2-mediated gene delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. By using the online Phosphorylation and Ubiquitination sites Prediction tools, we found out that the K137 or T251 residue but T505 residue might be an ubiquitination or phosphorylation site, while the residue S503, which is close to the T505 residue and equivalent to the S501 phosphorylation site of AAV2, might be an effective phosphorylation site of AAV-DJ. Thus, we hypothesize that mutation of these predicted sites K137, T251 and S503 in AAV-DJ may cause similar enhancements. In this study, the single point mutants of K137R/T251A/S503A at AAV-DJ capsid were generated respectively and further their differences for in vitro and in vivo transduction efficiency and tropism were evaluated.</p>

        <title>Construction of AAV-DJ mutants</title>
        <p>Phosphorylation and ubiquitination sites on the AAV-DJ capsid were determined using online prediction tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The predicted sites and conservative amino acid sequences nearby are shown in Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Mutations on the AAV-DJ rep/cap plasmid were carried out at K137R, S503A, and T251A by overlapping PCR, and primers are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. A two-stage procedure was performed to achieve the mutations. Briefly, in stage one, two PCR extension reactions were performed in separate tubes for each mutant. One tube contained the forward PCR primer at 5’ site of cap and the reverse primer with point mutation, and the other contained the reverse primer at 3’ site of cap and the forward PCR primer with the point mutation. In stage two, gel-purified PCR products from stage one were used as template at a ratio of 1:1, and a standard PCR was carried out using the forward and reverse primer of cap. The presence of the desired point mutation was verified by DNA sequencing.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Analysis of the phosphorylation and ubiquitination sites on AAV-DJ capsid</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Mutation</th><th>Phosphorylation-site prediction</th><th>Ubiquitination-site prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>K137R</td><td>―</td><td>Yes, high confidence</td></tr><tr><td>T251A</td><td>Yes</td><td>―</td></tr><tr><td>S503A</td><td>Yes</td><td>―</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Conservative amino acid sequences near the three single point mutations on AAV2, AAV8 and AAV-DJ capsids</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Serotype</th><th>K137R</th><th>T251A</th><th>S503A</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AAV2</td><td>EPVKTAP</td><td>ALPTYNN</td><td>YSWTGAT</td></tr><tr><td>AAV8</td><td>EGAKTAP</td><td>ALPTYNN</td><td>FAWTAGT</td></tr><tr><td>AAV-DJ</td><td>EAAKTAP</td><td>ALPTYNN</td><td>YSWTGAT</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Primer sequences of the three single point mutations on AAV-DJ capsid</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Residue</th><th>Sequence (5’ to 3’)</th><th>Nucleotide change</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">K137R</td><td>Wild-type primer sequence: TGAGGAAGCGGCT<underline>AAG</underline>ACG</td><td rowspan="2">

        <title>Generation of recombinant vectors</title>
        <p>Recombinant AAV vectors were generated by polyethyleneimine (PEI)-based triple transfection of 293 T cells. Briefly, twenty 150-mm<sup>2</sup> dishes 80 % confluent with 293 T cells were transfected with AAV rep/cap, transgene (pAAV-CAG-Gluc-2A-Fluc or pAAV-CBA-GFP), and AAV-helper free (pHelper) plasmids. Cells were collected at 72 h post-transfection, virus was released from the cells by three rounds of freeze–thawing.

        <title>AAV-DJ mutants led to significant improvement for gene delivery in adult C57BL/6 mice after intravenous injection</title>
        <p>To study whether the mutants we constructed can lead to differential gene expression in vivo, we used a dual-luciferase reporter system: Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) and Firefly luciferase (Fluc). The Gaussia luciferase is secretory, providing an all-over gene expressing analysis at different time points during the experiment, while the Firefly luciferase is nonsecretory, allowing visualization of localized gene expression via in vivo bioluminescence. In this study, each animal received 1 × 10<sup>11</sup>vg vectors by intravenous injection. First we collected venous blood via the tail at 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 days after vector injection and evaluated the relative light unit (RLU) emitted by the Gaussia luciferase using a luminometer. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, the RLU in each animal reached a peak at day 21 and maintained a level of 100,000 ~ 1,000,000 RLU. By two-way ANOVA analysis, the S503A mutant displayed significant enhancement of 2- to 3-fold at each time point (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), and the T251A mutant showed ~1.8-fold enhancement at day 21 and 28 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), while the K137R mutant showed no significant enhancement. To study the in vivo tropism of these vectors, animals were imaged after the last blood collection and the in vivo bioluminescence were analyzed. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, all vectors exhibited liver tropism. For further evaluation, we compared the viral genome copy numbers in different tissue samples at 42 days after vector injection by using real-time PCR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The results showed that the K137R, S503A and T251A mutants led to significant enhancement in transduction in liver samples with 2.1-, 3.5-, 2.5-fold higher DNA copy numbers respectively, compared to AAV-DJ. The S503A mutant resulted in 2- to 3- fold higher copy numbers in tibialis anterior (TA) and heart tissues while K137R showed 2.7-fold higher copy numbers in kidney tissue. No significant differences were observed in brain, lung and pancreas. To our surprise, the three mutants showed a significant decrease of 2 ~ 4 fold in DNA copy number than AAV-DJ in spleen tissue.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>AAV-DJ and its three single point mutant vectors mediated dual-luciferase expression levels in C57BL/6 mice. 1 × 10<sup>11</sup>vg of AAV vectors encoding dual-luciferase were delivered into 6–8 weeks old C57BL/6 male mice via tail vein injection.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Many efforts have been made to improve the efficacy of AAV-mediated gene transfer in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Among these, point mutation in the viral capsid protein seems to be the most simple and universal method. AAV transduction efficiency could be dramatically increased by mutations of particular capsid residues, which allowed the vectors to evade the intracellular phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Point mutation of specific tyrosine, serine, threonine or lysine was reported to significantly increase serotype 2 and 8 AAV-mediated gene transfer both in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. AAV-DJ, which can efficiently transduce a broad range of cell types in vitro, but has specific liver tropism in vivo, is a chimera of eight AAV serotypes and shares &gt;85 % sequence identity to the parental strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that point mutant of specific tyrosine, serine, threonine or lysine in AAV-DJ can further increase its transduction efficiency or change its tropism both in vitro and in vivo. Based on the fact that single point mutation on the T251, T503 residues of AAV2 or the K137 residue of AAV8 capsids can lead to significant gene expression enhancement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and through online Phosphorylation and Ubiquitination sites prediction, the K137, T251 and S503 residues of AAV-DJ capsid may be effective ubiquitination or phosphorylation sites, so we decided to generate the following three mutants of AAV-DJ: K137R, T251A and S503A.</p>
      <p>As shown in Results, these three mutants of AAV-DJ showed slight enhancement of GFP gene expression in 293 T, Hela and HepG2 cells. There may be several factors that contributed to the in vitro results. As demonstrated by Aslanidi et al., a multiple mutant of AAV2 led to ~24-fold higher efficiency in in vitro gene transduction, which was mainly because the combined mutants had better ability for escaping ubiquitination then resulting in more nuclear translocation and more transgene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In our study, we found no significant difference in in vitro gene delivery between AAV-DJ and its mutants, it might because AAV-DJ is a hybrid vector and already has better ability to evade from phosphorylation and ubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thus, single point mutations of AAV-DJ may not impact viral entry and cytoplasm/nuclear transgene distribution and is insufficient for enhancing gene delivery in vitro. It remains to be further investigated if multiple mutants of AAV-DJ could lead to enhancement in in vitro gene delivery. Aside from these mutations, AAV-DJ is a hybrid vector with receptor binding regions and major phosphorylation sites on the AAV capsid that may be different from its parental serotypes, thus the same residue mutant may lead to different effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Moreover, AAV-DJ display superior infectivity in many cell lines than AAV2, which was thought to be the best ex vivo gene delivery AAV vector, so there may be no significant potential for AAV-DJ mediated up-regulation of gene expression in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, significant enhancements in systemic gene expression level or liver tropism were observed in vivo when the vectors containing the luciferase reporters were injected into mice via tail vein. Two mutants we constructed showed significant enhancement in transduction efficiency in liver, especially for the S503A which exhibited rapid gene expression and maintained higher gene expression level at all the time points investigated. Since the S503 residue of AAV-DJ was equivalent to the S501 residue of AAV2, which turn out to be an effective phosphorylation site of AAV2, it remains to be further studied if the S501A mutant of AAV2 could lead to significant enhancement in AAV2-mediated gene delivery. We would not expect a huge increase for gene expression just as the same mutants of AAV2 did, since AAV-DJ is a hybrid vector and had been strictly selected with human antisera, and has the best ability to avoid phosphorylation in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
      <p>Recently, some conflicting results were reported on the same residue mutants of different AAV serotypes. For example, the Y to F mutants of AAV2 can dramatically enhance gene transfer and expression both in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, Qiao and co-workers found negative effects when Y to F mutants were applied to AAV8 and AAV9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Our study on Y to F mutants of both AAV8 and AAV-DJ also displayed minimal enhancement of gene expression in vivo (to be published). Furthermore, Qiao et al. also obtained negative results of K137R on AAV8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], which were reported to enhance gene expression by 5 to 10 fold in liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These inconsistent results may be caused by using different reporters contributing to various measurements of transduction efficiency, incorrect vector titers, dilutions, and/or inconsistent vector potency from batch to batch.</p>
      <p>In summary, the AAV-DJ capsid mutants (S503A/T251A) generated in this study led to significant improvements in systemic transgene expression and exhibited liver tropism after tail vein injection in mice. Thus, the enhanced AAV vectors have great potential for future gene therapy applications.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a highly prevalent herpesvirus, which maintains lifelong latency and places a significant burden on host immunity. Infection is associated with increased rates of vascular disease and overall mortality in the elderly and there is an urgent need for improved understanding of the viral-host balance during ageing.</p>
          <p>CMV is extremely difficult to detect in healthy donors, however, using droplet digital PCR of DNA from peripheral blood monocytes, we obtained an absolute quantification of viral load in 44 healthy donors across a range of ages.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Viral DNA was detected in 24 % (9/37) of donors below the age of 70 but was found in all individuals above this age. Furthermore, the mean CMV load was only 8.6 copies per 10,000 monocytes until approximately 70 years of age when it increased by almost 30 fold to 249 copies in older individuals (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). CMV was found within classical CD14+ monocytes and was not detectable within the CD14-CD16+ subset. The titre of CMV-specific IgG increased inexorably with age indicating that loss of humoral immunity is not a determinant of the increased viral load. In contrast, although cellular immunity to the structural late protein pp65 increased with age, the T cell response to the immediate early protein IE1 decreased in older donors.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>These data reveal that effective control of CMV is impaired during healthy ageing, most probably due to loss of cellular control of early viral reactivation. This information will be of value in guiding efforts to reduce CMV-associated health complications in the elderly.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of eight human herpesviruses and maintains a state of lifelong latency within the host following primary infection. CMV is highly prevalent in all parts of the world and infection rates increase with age, with seropositivity estimated between 50 and 95 % in those aged over 5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Viral replication is controlled by the development of a strong cellular and humoral CMV-specific immune response and this must be maintained throughout life in order to prevent episodes of clinically significant viral reactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The magnitude of the CMV-specific immune response within the blood is very large and higher than has been recorded against other pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover this immune response increases further with age in a phenomenon that has been termed ‘memory inflation’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This is associated with reduction in the CD4:8 ratio and accumulation of large numbers of late-differentiated memory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, there is now concern that CMV infection can serve to accelerate the development of immune senescence and several studies have shown that CMV seropositivity is associated with a range of clinical problems and increased risk of mortality in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although CMV rarely leads to overt clinical problems after primary infection, it is believed that subclinical episodes of CMV reactivation occur frequently during a lifetime but are rapidly controlled by the host immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In order to understand more about the mechanisms by which CMV infection may impact on the health of elderly donors it is important to improve understanding of the level of CMV load within the blood and how this is related to specific features of the CMV-specific immune response. This information might then potentially be used to determine the optimal ‘set point’ of viral-host balance and as such serve as an aspiration to achieve within future interventional therapy, for instance with anti-viral or immune modulatory treatment.</p>
      <p>The sites of CMV latency include haemopoietic stem cells, monocytes and epithelial cells. However the level of CMV within the blood is very low and conventional PCR assays are almost invariably negative in healthy donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Indeed this is a useful clinical finding, as a positive CMV PCR is generally interpreted as evidence of clinically significant reactivation in immune suppressed donors and can be used to guide anti-viral therapy. However, purification of discrete cell subsets that harbor viral infection, followed by PCR amplification, is one approach that can be taken to increase the sensitivity of viral detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Self-renewing CD34+ haemopoietic stem cells represent a reservoir for maintaining viral infection and it has been estimated that latent virus is present in 0.01–0.001 % of myeloid progenitor cells within bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Monocytes are the major mature haemopoietic cellular host for CMV carriage and the frequency of infected cells is thought to be approximately 10 fold lower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Viral latency is maintained during monocytic carriage, whereas lytic viral replication can only arise following differentiation of monocytes into macrophages, due to changes in the pattern of chromatin binding to the immediate early promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
      <p>The use of highly sensitive PCR assays increases the frequency of CMV detection and nested PCR offers the advantage of substantial sensitivity but is poorly quantitative. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a new approach that provides a highly sensitive and direct method for detection of target DNA without the need for developing a ‘standard curve’. ddPCR emulsifies an oil-based PCR reaction into thousands of droplets, each of which then acts as a PCR micro-reaction and increases the chances of a rare event being detected. Using Poisson’s distribution, a direct measurement of the target DNA can then be determined. ddPCR does not therefore rely on any interpretation of rate-based data, as is the case with Q-PCR. The sensitivity and versatility of ddPCR for detection of low copy number events has been shown in several settings and is increasingly part of clinical practice for monitoring mutations levels in malignant disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
      <p>We have utilized purification of monocytes combined with droplet digital PCR to permit accurate quantification of the level of CMV within the blood of healthy donors. Our data showed that this provides a highly informative technique to quantify CMV viral load. Moreover they revealed that virus is found infrequently within the blood until the age of around 70 years when it becomes detectable in every donor. We showed that virus is present exclusively within the ‘classical’ CD14+ monocyte fraction and that the increase in viral load correlated with a decrease in the cellular immune response to immediate early protein. These findings have important implications for understanding the biology and clinical complications of CMV infection.</p>

        <p>Blood samples were obtained from 44 healthy donors between 25 and 86 years of age. CD14+ monocytes were purified by positive selection using magnetic beads and then DNA was extracted using miniprep kits. CMV-specific PCR primers and droplet digital PCR analysis (ddPCR) was then used to determine the number and proportion of CMV-positive droplets within each sample. Positive droplets were defined as those detectable above the set threshold (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and Poisson’s distribution was used to determine the absolute copy number of the reaction. Using this approach, CMV was detected in 16 of the 44 donors (36 %) and was confirmed in each case by 3 independent runs.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CMV viral load in monocytes increases with ageing.

        <title>CMV viral load within monocytes increases markedly above the age of 70 years</title>
        <p>When the results were assessed in relation to donor age it was clear that the proportion of donors in whom CMV was detectable increased markedly with age. Specifically, CMV was detected in 9 of 37 (24 %) of donors aged below 70 years whereas a positive test was seen in each of the 7 donors above this age (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). In those aged 20–30 years, only 1 out of 6 donors (16.7 %) had a detectable load, compared to 1 out of 4 (25 %) in 30–40 year olds, 1 out of 13 (7.7 %) in 40–50 year olds, 3 out of 8 (37.5 %) in 50–60 year olds and 3 out of 6 (50 %) in 60–70 year olds.</p>
        <p>The absolute quantification of CMV viral load in relation to monocyte number was then determined by QuantaSoft® software in order to generate a value of ‘viral load per 10,000 monocytes’. In those donors in whom CMV was detectable by ddPCR, the absolute viral load varied markedly from 3 copies per 10,000 monocytes to 353 copies per 10,000 monocytes, a range of 117 fold. This value was also found to increase with age, again with a marked increase observed in donors aged over 70 years (kruskal-wallis <italic>p</italic> = 0.0005). The mean viral load in donors aged below 70 years was 8.6 copies per 10,000 monocytes (SD 38), with a 29-fold increase in those over the age of 70, where the mean viral load was 249 copies per 10,000 monocytes (SD 59) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Modelling of the data with an exponential growth curve showed that the CMV viral load doubling time was 9.6 years (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.64) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec5">
        <title>The increase in CMV viral load with age is confirmed through the use of quantitative PCR</title>
        <p>We next used a second method in order to confirm the observation of an increase in CMV load within monocytes in relation to age. Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) was applied to the same sample cohort using an average plasmid series dilution, which produced an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.983 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1A). Using triplicate runs, Q-PCR was sensitive down to a single copy of plasmid CMV per reaction. This same series of diluted plasmids was then verified using ddPCR and the absolute copy number of CMV was calculated through QuantaSoft® software. ddPCR was again capable of detecting 1 copy of CMV per reaction indicating that results generated from ddPCR and Q-PCR correlated very strongly (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.995; <italic>p</italic> = &lt;0.0001) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1B).</p>
        <p>We then used Q-PCR to assess CMV load within the 44 samples of monocyte DNA from healthy donors. Thirteen of the 16 samples that were found to be positive by digital PCR were also detected as positive by Q-PCR (81 %). Twenty-seven out of the 28 samples that were negative by ddPCR were also negative by Q-PCR and only one was reported positive by Q-PCR. The correlation between the two techniques using 13 results that were positive by both methods had a co-efficient of determination of R<sup>2</sup> = 0.626 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0013). The Q-PCR technique also revealed a pronounced increase in viral load in association with age (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1C).</p>

        <title>CMV viral load is detectable within CD34+ haemopoietic cells and is focused within ‘classical’ CD14+ monocytes</title>
        <p>In order to determine the distribution of CMV load within different cells of the myeloid lineage we then went on to perform ddPCR on purified CD34+ haemopoietic stem cells and individual monocyte subsets. CD14 and CD16 expression can be used to subdivide the major subpopulations of monocytes into CD14 + CD16-, CD14 + CD16+ and CD14-CD16+ subsets (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Fractions of G-CSF-mobilised peripheral blood were obtained from five haemopoietic stem cell donors and cells were sorted into CD34+ stem cells and monocytic subsets (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). CMV was detected in 3 of these 5 samples through the use of both ddPCR and Q-PCR. Interestingly, within the monocyte subsets, CMV was found only within classical monocytes with a CD14+ phenotype whereas the CD14-CD16+ subset was entirely negative by both assays (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>CMV viral load is detectable in CD14 positive monocytes.

        <title>The titre of the CMV-specific IgG response increases with age</title>
        <p>Our previous data showed an increase in CMV load within the peripheral blood during healthy ageing, so we next went on to determine the magnitude of the CMV-specific immune response in association with age. In particular, we assessed if the increase in viral load might result from a reduction in the magnitude of virus-specific immunity or if the immune response might actually increase as a response to the increased level of virus in the blood. We therefore determined the CMV-specific IgG titre using a quantitative ELISA assay against viral lysate. Interestingly, antibody titre increased substantially during ageing with a three fold increase in titre between the ages of 20 and 80 years (mean titre 65.1 in donors aged 20 years compared to 232 in those aged over 70); r = 0.473; <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). This increase in titre developed gradually during ageing and therefore had a different pattern to the quite dramatic elevation in viral load that was seen only after the age of 70 years (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>CMV igG titre increases with ageing.

        <title>The CMV-specific T cell response to pp65 also increases with age whereas recognition of IE-1 is reduced in elderly donors</title>
        <p>We next went on to assess the magnitude of the T cell immune response against CMV within the study cohort. Specifically, we focused on the cellular responses to pp65 and immediate early 1 (IE-1), which are two of the most immunodominant components of the CMV proteome. Several previous studies have reported the substantial magnitude of the CMV-specific T cell immune response within peripheral blood and have also identified that this can increase further with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
        <p>T cells were stimulated with peptide pools containing immunodominant epitopes from either pp65 or IE-1 and the IFN-γ release by peptide-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells was then determined by flow cytometry (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The magnitude of the pp65-specific CD8+ T cell immune response ranged from 0 to 5.5 % of the CD8+ T cell pool, with a median value of 0.28 %. This value was over two-fold higher in those donors with detectable CMV viral load within monocytes compared to donors in whom the ddPCR was negative, but this did not reach statistical significance (0.5 vs 0.23 % respectively; <italic>p</italic> = 0.087). The pp65-specific T cell response also increased markedly with age, from a median value of 0.17 % in 20–30 year olds to 1.17 % in those aged greater than 70 years (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.146, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03). A positive correlation with age was also noted following pp65 stimulation of CD4+ T cells, although this did not reach statistical significance.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>The T cell response to the immunodominant CMV protein pp65 increases with age.

        <p>In contrast to pp65, the frequency of CD8+ T cells recognizing IE-1 initially increased with age, but then peaked in people aged 50–60 years and actually decreased in older donors (median 0.01 % &lt;50 years; 0.7 % 50–60 years and 0.1 % &gt;70 years old; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.05; <italic>p</italic> = 0.244). The CD4+ T cell response to IE-1 peptide stimulation was of small magnitude but remained relatively constant across each age group, with a median frequency of 0.01 % (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>).</p>
        <p>In summary, the magnitude of the cellular immune response to the structural late protein pp65 increased with age, whilst the CD8+ T cell response to IE-1 peaked at the age of 50–60 years and reduced thereafter.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Cytomegalovirus infection has been associated with a variety of health problems in elderly people and there is increasing interest in the mechanisms that underlie this association. A key determinant in this regard will be greater understanding of the balance of the viral load and the host immune response during healthy ageing. In this study we report, for the first time, that the level of cytomegalovirus viral load within the blood increased markedly in elderly people.</p>
      <p>A novel feature of our work was the use of digital droplet PCR to provide an accurate quantitative measure of latent viral DNA. Previous methods for detection of CMV from monocytic DNA generally relied on nested PCR techniques, which made quantification challenging and also raised substantial problems with reproducibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Quantitative PCR is far more accurate but relies on interpretation of the cycle threshold of a sample against a known calibration standard. This is restricted by the lower limit of detection of the standards and the rate of amplification, which can vary between different PCR runs. In contrast, digital PCR provides an absolute quantification and avoids these limitations. Our analysis included a direct comparison of ddPCR and Q-PCR and, as expected, we observed an extremely high concordance between the two technologies. However ddPCR was found to offer superior sensitivity and reliability of detection. Seventeen samples were found to be positive by either ddPCR or Q-PCR, 16 of these by ddPCR and 14 by Q-PCR.</p>
      <p>Our work was performed using DNA isolated from monocytes, which are established as the most important haemopoietic site of viral latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and which in murine infection also serve to disseminate viral infection to distal sites such as salivary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The first interesting finding was the observation that CMV was detectable in only a minority of donors, as 64 % of people remained negative by ddPCR despite the presence of chronic infection as confirmed by CMV-specific IgG positivity. Indeed, in younger people below the age of 50 years, the detection of CMV load in the blood was uncommon, being observed in only 13 % of donors tested. The lower limit of detection provided by ddPCR in our assay was for a single copy of virus within the total reaction volume (20 μl) and as such a negative result indicated absent or extremely low levels of virus. This low level carriage may reflect a lower intrinsic probability of viral reactivation in younger donors but is perhaps more likely to reflect the consequence of effective immune surveillance of viral replication in younger individuals.</p>
      <p>The frequency of viral detection increased markedly with each decade above the age of 50 years to 37.5 and 50 % and finally became positive in every donor who was older than 70. Interestingly the amount of viral DNA detected within the blood also increased substantially with age with a 29 fold increase observed between donors aged less than 70 and those over this age. The use of nested PCR also detected viral DNA within the majority of healthy elderly donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These data indicate that a gradual impairment in the ability to control CMV load within blood starts around the age of 50 years and then deteriorates markedly beyond the age of 70. Importantly, our work did not address the number of CMV copies within individual monocytes, which has previously been shown to vary between 2 and 13 copies per cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Thus, it remains uncertain if ageing is associated with an increase in the number of viral copies within each infected monocyte or if there is an increase in the proportion of infected cells.</p>
      <p>We were also interested to use the sensitivity of ddPCR to examine the presence of CMV within specific subsets of the myelo-monocytic lineage. CD14 and CD16 can be used to delineate three major subclasses of monocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], classical monocytes (CD14 + CD16-) which account for &gt;70 % of peripheral monocytes and are important for innate immunity. These, together with intermediate monocytes (CD14 + CD16+) have more phagocytic properties than their non-classical CD14-CD16++ counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Our data suggested that CMV was not detectable within CD14-CD16+ monocyte cells, a finding which is in contrast to murine CMV, where CD16+ monocytes have been shown to exhibit higher levels of CMV latency than CD14+ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
      <p>We were also interested to compare levels of CMV load within haemopoietic precursors of the terminally differentiated monocytic lineage. As such we isolated CD34+ haemopoietic stem cells from G-CSF mobilized blood donations. CMV was detected in 3 of these 5 samples, which is comparable to a previous report of 8 positive samples out of 12 using an alternative PCR methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This suggests that viral DNA may either pass selectively into cells that differentiate into the monocytic lineage or that some degree of viral replication occurs during myelopoiesis in order to sustain viral loads during the periods of cellular proliferation prior to monocyte formation.</p>
      <p>Importantly, the ddPCR assay detects the level of viral DNA but does not assess the level of infectious virion. CMV was not detected by ddPCR within plasma samples taken from donors identified to have a positive monocyte viral load (n = 10). This indicated that viral DNA was retained within cells, with no evidence of production of extracellular virus (data not shown).</p>
      <p>The direct measurement of viral DNA is a critical component in efforts to understand the balance of viral load and host immune response during natural CMV infection, an ambition that has been achieved so effectively for the study of HIV using RNA load. However, it is also important to correlate these values with assessment of the immune response to the virus.</p>
      <p>Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> gives a schematic overview of the parallel changes in immunity and viral load that arise following CMV infection over a lifetime. We observed that the humoral immune response to CMV increased steadily and markedly during ageing. Total immunoglobulin levels are known to fall with ageing and so our increase in CMV-specific antibody might appear somewhat surprising, but has in fact been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It is likely that episodes of subclinical viral reactivation serve to boost CMV-specific immunity and indeed this accumulation of CMV-specific immune memory may suppress the development of heterologous immune responses, which is a likely contributing factor towards immune senescence. Nevertheless these observations suggest that impairment in humoral immunity is not a major contributory factor towards the increase in viral load with ageing.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>An overview of the parallel changes in viral load and immunity during the lifetime of an individual infected with Cytomegalovirus. Schematic representation of the relative changes in the peripheral blood viral load as well as humoral and T cell immune response to CMV over the human life-course. Primary infection is shown as occurring during childhood, the most common age of infection. CMV viral load and CMV-specific IgG antibody titre increases during ageing. CD8 T cell responses to IE-1 peptides peaked in people aged 50–60 years and then decreased in older donors, while T cell response to pp65 peptides increase with ageing</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12979_2015_56_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p>
      <p>Studies have shown that the T cell immune response to CMV increases markedly with age such that the virus-specific CD8+ T cell response can come to dominate the CD8+ T cell repertoire in some donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This profile of ‘memory inflation’ is also seen in murine CMV infection and is believed to be driven by recognition of viral peptides on non-haemopoietic cells. Relatively little is known about the specific profile of CMV proteins that drive CD8+ T cell expansion during ageing, although the importance of structural proteins such as pp65 are well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Indeed, the presence of CMV DNA within monocytic cells has been correlated with increased pp65-specific T cell immunity in elderly donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>Our work also observed an expansion of pp65-specific T cells in relation to ageing, with an 8.4 fold increase between the youngest and most elderly donors and may reflect an incremental accumulation to recurrent subclinical episodes of viral reactivation. However, assessment of the T cell recognition of peptides derived from the immediate early protein IE-1 revealed an increase in middle aged individuals, with reduced recognition in those of an advanced age. This observation supports previous work, which has reported no significant increase in the IE-1 specific immune response with ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>
      <p>It is currently unclear why IE-1 responses appear to wane with age. An important factor may relate to the frequency of T cell exposure to IE-derived epitopes, as these are presented to T cells repeatedly during the early period of viral replication and serve to elicit a cellular immune response that can prevent the late stages of viral infection before late viral proteins such as pp65 are produced. As such IE-1-specific T cells are exposed to very high levels of antigen stimulation and may be more susceptible to functional exhaustion than those directed against late-stage viral proteins such as pp65 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However the explanation for the differing T cell responses to IE-1 and pp65 with ageing remains unclear and will require larger cross sectional and longitudinal study.</p>
      <p>The concept that ageing leads to an alteration in the balance between viral load and the host immune response during chronic viral infection is supported by a variety of clinical and immunological observations. Herpes zoster, which represents reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV), is more common in the elderly and VZV titres increase with age, a pattern also reported for Epstein Barr Virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Finally, levels of the persistent and highly prevalent Torque tenovirus are also known to increase markedly with ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In conclusion, these data reveal the delicate balance that has evolved between chronic CMV infection and the host immune response and indicate that this symbiosis can break down during ageing, where an increase in CMV viral load occurs as the attritional effects of chronic surveillance and the impact of immune senescence become more apparent. It is likely that increased understanding of the clinical importance of chronic viral infection on human health will become an important health consideration in future years.</p>

        <title>Healthy donors</title>
        <p>Forty-four CMV positive healthy donors (confirmed by CMV ELISA) were recruited for study between the ages of 25 and 86 (mean 50.5). Healthy individuals below the age of 65 were recruited from The University of Birmingham, whilst those over 65 were recruited as part of the ongoing Birmingham 1000 elder’s cohort which recruits elderly healthy donors from the local community. Following a 50 ml blood donation, plasma and PBMCs were extracted over a ficoll density gradient and stored at −160 °C. PBMCs were used for functional T cell studies and monocyte extraction whilst plasma was used for CMV ELISA testing.</p>
        <p>Five peripheral blood stem cell donors who had received G-CSF mobilization were also recruited and aliquots of PBMC stored at −160 °C prior to defrosting and extraction of myeloid cell subsets.</p>

        <p>Using the QX100 droplet digital PCR system (Bio-rad, Pleasanton, CA), a reaction mixture consisting of 5ul of either CD14 positive DNA (10 ng/ul) or plasmid standard made up to a volume of 8ul with PCR grade water, 10ul of 2 × ddPCR supermix for probes (Bio-rad), 1ul of reconstituted FAM labeled CMV primer and probe (Primer Design) and 1ul of HEX labeled RPP30 copy number assay for ddPCR (Bio-Rad) were loaded into a disposable plastic cartridge for droplet generation (Bio-Rad). Seventy microlitre of droplet generation oil (Bio-Rad) was also added before loading the cartridge into the droplet generator (Bio-Rad). After droplet generation, the sample was loaded into a 96 well PCR plate (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and PCR amplification carried out using the T100 thermocycler (Bio-Rad). PCR conditions consisted of 10 min at 95 °C, prior to 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s and 60 s at 60 °C and a finally 1 cycle at 10 min at 98 °C, ending at 12 °C. After amplification the plate was loaded onto the droplet reader (Bio-rad) and results analysed by QuantaSoft® software (Bio-Rad) to give the number of virus copies per ul of PCR reaction. A positive and negative control was used in each experiment, which also verified the consistency of droplet amplitude, and a well consisting solely of water was also included. Results were obtained in triplicate. As each mammalian cell contains 2 copies of RPP30, the absolute quantification of RPP30 was divided by two in order to determine the actual cell number.

        <p>One way ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis test) and post hoc Dunn’s testing was used to compare CMV viral load with age. A growth exponential curve was used to assess the CMV load doubling time and linear regression used to assess the relationship between CMV copies (log<sub>10</sub>) and the age of participants. For the standard dilution series ran in triplicate, the results were log transformed log<sub>10</sub> and Pearson’s correlation co-efficient was used to compare the quantitative agreement between ct value and plasmid copy number. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between ddPCR copy number reading and that of the plasmid dilution and also to compare Q-PCR copy number with that of ddPCR in healthy donor samples. Pearson’s correlation co-efficient was used to examine the relationship between CMV IgG titre and age. For comparison of age against functional T cell responses against Spearman’s correlation co-efficient was used. Mann-Whitney testing was used to compare IFN-y responses in T cells following peptide stimulation in those with detectable viral load compared to those without.

          <p>Domesticated animals quickly evolve docile and submissive behaviors after isolation from their wild conspecifics. Model organisms reared for prolonged periods in the laboratory also exhibit similar shifts towards these domesticated behaviors. Yet whether this divergence is due to inadvertent selection in the lab or the fixation of deleterious mutations remains unknown.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Here, we compare the genomes of lab-reared and wild-caught <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to understand the genetic basis of these recently endowed behaviors common to laboratory models. From reassembled genomes of common lab strains, we identify unique, derived variants not present in global populations (lab-specific SNPs). Decreased selective constraints across low frequency SNPs (unique to one or two lab strains) are different from patterns found in the wild and more similar to neutral expectations, suggesting an overall accumulation of deleterious mutations. However, high-frequency lab SNPs found in most or all lab strains reveal an enrichment of X-linked loci and neuro-sensory genes across large extended haplotypes. Among shared polymorphisms, we also find highly differentiated SNPs, in which the derived allele is higher in frequency in the wild (Fst*<sub>wild&gt;lab</sub>), enriched for similar neurogenetic ontologies, indicative of relaxed selection on more active wild alleles in the lab.</p>

          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Among random mutations that continuously accumulate in the laboratory, we detect common adaptive signatures in domesticated lab strains of fruit flies. Our results demonstrate that lab animals can quickly evolve domesticated behaviors via unconscious selection by humans early on a broad pool of disproportionately large neurogenetic targets followed by the fixation of accumulated deleterious mutations on functionally similar targets.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Our recent history of domesticating plants and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] offers a diversity of genetic systems to study evolution in action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Crop and livestock breeders often provoke relatively large phenotypic changes across successive generations conditioned on available standing genetic variation found in wild progenitor populations. Such changes demonstrate the formidable power of directional selection over relatively short periods of time. In fact, Charles Darwin devoted the opening chapter of “On the origins of species” to artificial selection in order to introduce natural selection as the principal driver of evolutionary change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In his two-volume follow-up devoted specifically to domestication, Darwin noted that “selection may be followed either methodically and intentionally, or unconsciously and unintentionally” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These histories can also be modeled as a co-evolutionary framework between humans and the crops and livestock they cultivate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], whether the selective pressures were intentional or not.</p>
      <p>While domesticates usually have reduced effective population sizes relative to their ancestral populations, there still remains ample variation for selection to act upon. Numerous loci involved in animal and crop domestication are found to harbor positive selection coefficients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and selectively swept regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In domestic chickens, genomic sequences from multiple lines reveal the presence of selective sweeps leading to the discovery of causative agents in growth differences between domestic lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In household pets, selection for certain behavioral and sensory traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] have produced signatures of positive selection in vision and hearing genes in domesticated cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and neural development genes in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The growing literature on crop, livestock, and pet domestication reveals that long-term selection by humans can generate strong signals of selection at the genomic level and provides a new lens into the strength and target of selection during our recent domesticated past.</p>
      <p>Animals bred in the laboratory as model organisms may also be adapted to human conditions, and over a much shorter time period. Studies comparing laboratory strains of mice and nematodes have identified genetic differences in genes involved in behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] suggesting adaptation to novel conditions in the laboratory (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]). Over a century ago, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> was brought into the laboratory initially as a teaching tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and its fast generation time and relative ease of maintenance quickly made the fruit fly an important genetics research tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] in such varied fields such as development, physiology, and evolution. Canton-S(pecial), the oldest known wildtype fly stock, was captured by Calvin Bridges over a century ago from a natural population in Canton, Ohio, and first debuted in his seminal 1916 paper on “Non-disjunction as proof of the chromosome theory of heredity” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Approximately a decade later, Donald Lancefield, another product of Thomas Morgan’s prolific lab at Columbia University, extracted Oregon-R from a population in Roseburg, Oregon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Many commonly used fly stocks eventually coalesce ancestrally to these old North American laboratory stalwarts, Canton-S and Oregon-R (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), which were independently extracted from populations in North America and themselves possessing relatively recent African origins ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Hypothetical genealogical relationship of laboratory strains in relation to global populations of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and the closely related species, <italic>D. simulans</italic>. The five lab strains are indicated in red with hypothetical ancestral relationships marked as a dotted line. Estimated time since common ancestors are indicated below</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12862_2015_580_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
      <p>With at least a dozen generations per year, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> lab stocks have been isolated from their wild ancestors for over a thousand generations, providing ample time to sufficiently diverge. It is known among fruit fly researchers that behavioral traits of laboratory <italic>vs</italic>. wild <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are distinct, with lab-reared flies far tamer and more manageable than those found in the wild. Although lab-reared flies are generally maintained under relatively standard conditions of temperature, light, and diet, selective pressures in the lab are very different than those found in the wild providing the potential for strong selection for human-accommodating phenotypes and/or the relaxation of selection on traits adapted in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. On the other hand, domesticates are generally less reproductively fit than their wild relatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and may exhibit similar less optimal behavioral phenotypes. Lab stocks typically experience drastic decreases in population size and higher levels of inbreeding ultimately decreasing the efficacy of selection to rid lines of continually re-occurring deleterious alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Whether these phenotypic differences in lab strains are driven by conscious selection, inadvertent selection, a relaxation in selection, or are simply the fixation of deleterious mutations, is not known.</p>
      <p>Its relatively recent and well-documented history, access to multiple isolated lines reared in similar environmental settings, well-characterized functional annotations, and the availability of hundreds of genomes from extensively sampled extant populations including a closely related species, make <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> an ideal model system to study the evolutionary processes that underlie rapid phenotypic change. Here, we investigate genetic differences between common laboratory stains of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> to those recently caught from nature to examine whether this important, centuries-old genetic model has evolved convergent domesticated behaviors by adapting to a bottled existence or being inundated by low-fitness alleles. We first document behavioral differences between lab-reared and wild-caught flies with respect to their general activity and locomotory abilities. We then identify SNPs that are differentiated between the genomes of laboratory and wild strains to evaluate the roles of selection <italic>vs</italic>. drift in flies isolated in bottles. Among uniquely derived alleles found only in lab strains we find patterns of drift and selection across, respectively, low and high frequency classes, when comparing evolutionary parameters such as Grantham distance, missense to silent mutations, positional distribution within codons, and levels of codon bias. We further characterize putative regions under sustained selection among lab strains and find longer than expected haplotypes near high-frequency derived SNPs, also enriched in neuro-sensory genes. Finally, we suggest that this neurogenetic class, residing on a disproportionately large fraction of the genome relative to other functional classes, provides a large mutational target for genetic variation to accumulate and selection to act upon. Thus, the genomics of fly domestication reveal an interplay of evolutionary forces with mutation and selection on a large neurogenetic class of genes playing a pivotal role in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>’s brief, but distinguished, history in the laboratory.</p>

        <title>Behavior</title>
        <p>Although it is well-known among Drosophilists that lab strains are much slower and easier to handle than live flies, literature documenting these differences is lacking. We first confirm anecdotal reports of differences in the overall activity between laboratory stocks (Canton-S, Oregon-R, w<sup>1118</sup>) and flies from wild populations (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). On average, flies from lab strains are significantly less active than wild-caught individuals using different measures of locomotion including standard and angular velocities (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1A,B; Wilcoxon <italic>P &lt; 0.05</italic>) and time-spent moving <italic>vs</italic>. stationary (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S1C, S1D; Wilcoxon <italic>P &lt; 0.05)</italic>. Lab strains also demonstrate less responsiveness in the form of interactions between individuals compared to wild-caught lines where the latter’s movement is more uniformly distributed and gradually increases with proximity to neighbors (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1E). Flies from laboratory strains do not appear to follow this relationship with motion uncorrelated to the proximity with their nearest neighbor (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1F). Overall, these results provide general support for a convergence of slow-moving and less responsive behavior in lab strains.</p>

        <title>Genetic variation in lab strains</title>
        <p>After applying filters for quality and missing data, a total of 98,442,787 base pairs were analyzed across five reassembled laboratory strains of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, 516 genomes from 23 global populations including an extensively sampled population from North America (<italic>n</italic> = 205), and one closely related species, <italic>D. simulans</italic>. Among 14,545,645 polymorphic sites, 68.5 % are non-singletons and used for subsequent analyses (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1). To test for signals of domestication, we used three defined categories of SNPs differentiated between lab strains and populations of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> from nature: lab-specific SNPs and two types of highly differentiated F<sub>ST</sub> (Fst*) SNPs, depending on whether the derived allele is found at a higher frequency among lab strains (Fst*<sub>lab&gt;wild</sub>), or in a representative natural population (Fst*<sub>wild&gt;lab</sub>). While distinct, some overlap exists between the lab-specific and Fst*<sub>lab&gt;wild</sub> analysis categories: out of a total 50,565 differentiated SNPs, 520 SNPs are common to these two SNP classes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). In contrast, Fst*<sub>wild&gt;lab</sub> SNPs are unique and relatively rare (<italic>n</italic> = 123; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Characterization of derived SNPs differentiated between lab strains and a wild <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> population. <bold>a</bold> Number and overlap of lab-specific SNPs (derived and unique among lab strains) with Fst*<sub>lab&gt;wild</sub> SNPs (derived allele is higher in frequency among lab strains compared to sequenced flies from Raleigh NC).

        <sec id="Sec5">
          <title>Lab-specific SNPs</title>
          <p>The number of lab-specific SNPs is 17,250, with 9,258 and 1,951 SNPs located in genic and CDS regions, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). The total number of lab-specific SNPs is significantly larger than a subsample of five random genomes from North Carolina and comparison of the number of SNPs specific to this random subset against the entire North Carolinian dataset (performed 1,000 times; Sign test, <italic>P &lt; 0.002</italic>) as well as the entire global dataset (Sign test, <italic>P &lt; 0.001</italic>). Lab-specific SNPs represent only a small fraction (0.017 %) of the total SNP variation found among global populations of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, including singletons. Lab-specific SNPs are distributed across all chromosome arms with a slight but significant enrichment across non-coding regions (e.g., intergenic, 1.02x, χ<sup>2</sup> = 33.56, <italic>P &lt; 0.001</italic>; intronic, 1.05x, χ<sup>2</sup> = 19.11, <italic>P &lt; 0.001;</italic> Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref>). The X-chromosome is enriched for mid- and high-frequency lab-specific SNPs (χ<sup>2</sup> = 201.48, <italic>P &lt; 0.001</italic>). The number of fixed lab-specific SNPs (i.e., found in all five lab strains, or 4/4 due to missing data) was 75, 46, and 32, respectively, in all genomic regions, genic, and CDS regions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1). Genes containing fixed lab-specific SNPs are enriched for regulatory and signaling gene ontology (GO) categories (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3) and up-regulated in neural-sensory tissues (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S2).</p>

          <title>Fst*<sub>lab&gt;wild</sub> SNPs</title>
          <p>The number of derived SNPs with high F<sub>ST</sub> (i.e., Fst*) that harbor a greater frequency in the lab compared to the wild is 33,172, with 18,284 and 4,116 in genic and CDS regions respectively (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1). Fst*<sub>lab&gt;wild</sub> SNPs generally describe variants that are highly represented (≥80 %) among lab strains but have a low (&lt;0.35) allele frequency in global populations. Fst*<sub>lab&gt;wild</sub> are uniformly distributed across chromosome arms and are enriched for genic regions (regulatory, 1.07x, χ<sup>2</sup> = 104.09, <italic>P &lt; 0.001</italic>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1). The number of Fst*<sub>lab&gt;wild</sub> SNPs that are fixed (i.e., found in all lab strains) is 30,396 and 3,829, respectively, in all genomic regions and CDS regions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1). Fst*<sub>lab&gt;wild</sub> SNPs are functionally enriched in general developmental gene ontology categories (100+ GO categories are significantly enriched; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3).

        <title>Evolutionary relationships</title>
        <p>Phylogenetic analyses on lab-specific SNPs and Fst* SNPs were performed to provide insight on the origin and relationship among isolated lab stocks (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S3). The lab-specific consensus SNP tree reveals Canton-S as ancestral to the three Oregon-R strains and the w<sup>1118</sup> strain, as expected (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S3A). The Fst* SNP consensus tree similarly shows a distinct lab monophyletic clade with similar bootstrap support for lab strain topology (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S3B). A distinct origin among lab strains is also seen using a random set of 100,000 polymorphic sites among lab and wild strains (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S3C). The branch lengths of the lab strains dramatically differ between trees indicating each lab strain’s distinctiveness (with the exception of OreR-661 and OreR-662) from each other (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S3A) and the extant North American population (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S3B). The three congruent phylogenetic trees also revealed several surprises including the three Oregon-R strains being paraphyletic, with Ore-661 and Ore-662 more similar to w<sup>1118</sup> than Ore-660. Also, while the original Oregon-R strain was independently sampled on the US west coast a few decades later, all lab strains appear to be derived from a single Canton-S common ancestor (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S3C), with the lab clade best supported next to extant populations from France, then North America.</p>

        <title>Genome-wide levels of selection</title>
        <p>To detect differences in selective constraints in the lab, we estimate a series of evolutionary parameters (Grantham distance, R/S ratio, C1/C2+C3, codon bias) across five frequency bins of lab-specific SNPs located in coding regions. We compare parameter estimates against similarly binned derived SNPs found only in the Raleigh NC population along with simulation estimates expected under strict neutrality. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1 compares the nature and number of lab-differentiated SNPs to those found in the Raleigh NC population across autosomes and X-chromosomes. When not binned according to allele frequency, mean Grantham scores, R/S, and C1/(C2+C3) ratios are similar to random simulations. However, when grouped by frequency class, parameter estimates of medium to high frequency SNPs more closely follow a pattern of similarly binned SNPs from the wild rather than expected neutral patterns based on a random mutational model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Frequency distribution of lab-specific (red), wild-caught (green), and neutrally simulated derived (between dotted lines) SNPs across various evolutionary parameters. <bold>a</bold> Mean Grantham score per replacement substitution. <bold>b</bold> Mean replacement/silent (R/S) ratio per SNP per individual. <bold>c</bold> Mean ratio of the number of first codon position (C1) SNPs to the number of second and third codon position (C2+C3) SNPs. <bold>d</bold> Mean proportion of non-preferred to preferred (N2P) codons and preferred to non-preferred (P2N) codons per individual.

        <p>The effective population size is a strong determinant of the effectiveness of selection and drift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

Like previous genome-wide estimates of nucleotide diversity from the Raleigh NC population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], our estimates of Θ similarly fluctuate across genomic regions with a genome-wide average of Θ<sub>NC</sub> = 0.0053 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S4).

        <title>Extended haplotype blocks</title>
        <p>Regions of extended homozygosity present potential signals of positive selection. We observe a mean haplotype length for all lab <italic>vs</italic>. wild differentiated classes of SNPs (lab-specific, Fst*<sub>lab&gt;wild</sub>, Fst*<sub>wild&gt;lab</sub>) of 653 bp (SD = 801 bp). Among lab-specific SNPs, long outlier haplotypes were only found within the high frequency class ≥0.8 and were significantly larger than all other frequency classes (Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>P</italic> = 3.41 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Under a neutral model, we would expect similar haplotype lengths across all frequency classes. In addition, we have run simulations in which we choose sites at random and estimate haplotype lengths. Using 1000 replicates, the random site haplotype lengths are at least two standard errors lower than the observed 5/5 haplotype lengths. A total of 457 (lab-specific: 112, Fst*<sub>lab&gt;wild</sub>: 342, Fst*<sub>wild&gt;lab</sub>: 3) large haplotype block outliers (Z<sub>hap</sub> &gt;2.5) were identified ranging in length from 2,622 bp to 11,985 bp and were significantly enriched (by nearly four times the expected amount) on the X-chromosome (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Candidate lab-specific, Fst*<sub>lab&gt;wild</sub>, and Fst*<sub>wild&gt;lab</sub> haplotype blocks contain, respectively, 135, 334, and 4 genes. Genes found within these lab-specific candidate haplotype blocks are enriched for neurogenetic gene ontology categories along with functional classes related to regulation and behavior responses (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) as well as other significant functional categories (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Table S4). However, when normalized by gene length, significant GO category enrichments in large lab-specific haplotype blocks disappear. Within large Fst*<sub>lab&gt;wild</sub> haplotype blocks, genes are enriched for GO classes involved with axon guidance, post-embryonic system development, and regulation (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), even after normalizing for gene length.

        <title>Phenotypic and genetic differences in laboratory stocks</title>
        <p>The captive genetic model, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, reveals hallmark features consistent with domestication. Laboratory strains show significant differences in behavior from their relatively recently isolated wild progenitors (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Previous studies comparing lab and wild-caught lines of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> also report differences in egg and larval survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and life history traits such as pre-adult development, early fecundity, and remating frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These traits comprise a suite of behavioral, physiological, and reproductive characters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] that have converged across multiple strains evolving independently under similar laboratory conditions. Furthermore, it previously has been demonstrated that these traits can quickly evolve significant differences in as little as 8–10 generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p>
        <p>It is paradoxical that domesticates, typically derived from small founder populations and maintained at very low effective population sizes, can effectively adapt to human conditions. From a population genetics perspective, we may expect the opposite: that small captive populations and lower N<sub>e</sub> propagate the segregation and eventual fixation of deleterious mutations, thus, imposing a potentially large mutational burden on laboratory strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Our evolutionary parameter analysis reveals such drift-like signatures at the low end of the site frequency spectrum. Estimates of Grantham distances, R/S ratios, codon positional fraction, and codon bias support a general genome-wide reduction in selection on low-frequency derived alleles in the lab (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) where mildly deleterious alleles may persist for longer periods of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. With a decrease in effective population size across each strain, inbreeding and drift dominate, which in turn, can quickly fix allelic and associated phenotypic changes across successive generations of captivity. Short-term isolation studies in Drosophila have shown similar rapid changes across a variety of phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] with reductions in performance levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]). Thus, the accumulation and fixation of mildly deleterious alleles, particularly on larger neurogenetic genes (see below), and subsequent inbreeding depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] may promote both the rapid nature of domestication and its associated convergence of common behavioral traits. These docile and non-aggressive traits may alternatively be described as “lethargic” (at least relative to their wild-caught conspecifics), a term commonly applied to inbred, and often sickly, Drosophila stocks.</p>
        <p>When did these changes occur? Our results suggest that these changes towards a domesticated phenotype likely began very early on based on available standing genetic variation of the progenitor population. While heterozygosity in each contemporary isofemale lab strain is virtually zero (data not shown), as a whole, these five lab strains collectively only harbor a two-fold genome-wide decrease in nucleotide diversity, Θ<sub>lab</sub>, relative to a large contemporary population from Raleigh NC (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S4). This diversity estimate primarily reflects the amount of genetic variation captured in each of the five lines from an ancestral population(s). The five lab strains share ~800,000 derived SNPs with extant global populations (a total of ~10 million non-singleton <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> SNPs pass our data filters) indicating that laboratory stocks collectively extracted a significant fraction <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genetic variation at their time of capture.</p>
        <p>The importance of ancestral standing genetic variation can also be seen in the 17,250 lab-specific SNPs. In theory, these SNPs represent any of the following: i) <italic>de novo</italic> mutations that arose in the lab, ii) genetic variation that previously existed in an extinct North American population, or iii) a subset of genetic variation that has been completely lost in extant global populations. We estimate that only a small fraction of these SNPs can be generated <italic>de novo</italic> (3.5 × 10<sup>−9</sup> mutations/bp/generation x 120 × 10<sup>6</sup> bp x 20 generations/yr x ~75 years x 5 strains ≈ 3,150 lab-specific SNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]). The remainder of the lab-specific SNPs was probably lost in extant wild populations during the last century. Strong evidence supports a recent global sweep in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> that dramatically reduced species-wide genetic variation after these particular lab strains were collected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Thus, from the large pool of available genetic variation from their North American progenitor populations, Canton-S and Oregon-R likely experienced similar selection pressures on common genetic variants (see below) during the earliest generations of lab domestication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. A phylogenetic analysis of shared lab/wild SNPs also supports a distinct origin of all lab strains (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S3). However, whether the lab strain monophyly is the result of an extinct progenitor population or the loss of global variation is unknown. The inclusion of more sequenced lab strains may differentiate between these two hypotheses.</p>

        <title>Adaptation in the lab</title>
        <p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, like <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, has been lab-cultured for over 50 years, and harbors pronounced differences in longevity and fertility when compared to wild isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Genome sequencing in the nematode identified SNPs differentiated between wild and long-term laboratory strains enriched for cell cycle and metabolic/growth genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Their results suggest the presence of strong selection early in nematode domestication for optimal growth under rich nutrient conditions similar to the significant GO term, “behavioral response to nutrients”, found among lab-specific SNPs in fruit flies (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Laboratory mice have similarly been shown to converge certain phenotypes including melatonin deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and a lack of aggression and tameness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The results from our evolutionary parameter analysis, when limited to lab-specific SNPs in the mid- to high frequency range, support that common phenotypic signals of domestication observed in the captive fruit fly have been strongly shaped by selection. These derived SNPs, found in the majority of lab strains, show similar evolutionary patterns to high frequency SNPs from the wild and not to neutral expectations, unlike low-frequency SNPs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The laboratory setting presents an immediate change in the fitness landscape, permitting rapid and significant changes in phenotype that would be detrimental to their fitness in the wild, across relatively few generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
        <p>Inadvertent human habituation and unintentional conditioning may be the primary selective agent for such known differences among lab strains as faster development and reproductive time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For instance, flies that rarely escape the bottle or benchtop may be selected due to human carelessness while fly stocks are transferred to new vials/bottles, or “flipped”. Our behavioral results support such a convergent shift towards less active and responsive flies (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). From our genomic analysis, we find that neurogenetic genes, involved in such biological processes as neurogenesis and axon development, are enriched in extended haplotype blocks common to differentiated SNPs (both lab-specific and highly differentiated Fst*) found at high allele frequencies (≥0.8), with an overrepresentation of fixations on the X-chromosome. These genes affect locomotion and visual cues suggesting lab selection on genes involved in behavioral responses.</p>
        <p>While an excess of long extended haplotypes on high frequency lab-specific SNPs support an adaptive shift towards domesticated phenotypes, a relaxation of selection on certain loci involved in behavior may have co-occurred in the lab. Conditions in the laboratory are often optimized for growth and reproduction, reducing the natural ability of flies to escape predators or compete for food and mates. Thus, a relaxation of selection on activity levels, aggressiveness, and responsiveness, critical in the wild, may also drive the behavioral differences that converged across lab strains. Characters involved in mating, driven by the sparsity of mates in the vicinity, is a key difference between domestic and wild species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Our behavioral results, showing a reduction in interactive activity in lab flies, is consistent with this hypothesis. In addition, our GO analysis of shared Fst*<sub>wild&gt;lab</sub> SNPs, in which the derived allele is more frequent in the Raleigh NC population than lab strains, finds a significant enrichment of the neurogenetic functional class, even when corrected for gene size. These SNPs are found in different genes than the SNPs harbored in long extended haplotype blocks, suggesting an extensive cache of genes involved in behavioral differences between flies reared in the lab and those found in the wild. A similar decrease in behavioral activity was observed in lab strains of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], with backcrossing to wild mice isolates allowing them to regain these previously lost behavioral functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p>
        <p>The use of inbred laboratory strains of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> presented unique analytical challenges that differ from other domesticated studies. Due to initial and recurrent inbreeding and the lack of an interbreeding population, laboratory strains violate most population genetic models used to infer selection. In this study, the site frequency spectrum is only applied across isolated lab strains as a framework to bin our observed data and could not be used to infer population genetic parameters. Despite these difficulties, our results reveal an interplay of drift and selection at work in the lab. First, we find genome-wide levels of selective constraints in the lab that are significantly lower than a sampled North American population. This pattern is likely caused by low effective population sizes in bottles that promote the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations under drift-like conditions, which we also observe in low frequency alleles. Second, we observe derived SNPs that are highly differentiated between the lab and a North American population to be significantly enriched in neurogenetic genes, suggesting a differential fitness landscape in behavior. This functional enrichment takes into account the number of genes in each functional class as well as their size. Third, we find signatures of positive selection on extended haplotypes in both lab-specific and highly differentiated SNPs. These, too, are significantly enriched in neurogenetic genes. Fourth, there’s an enrichment of these changes on the X-chromosome (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1). The preferential role of the X-chromosome is seen in marked differences in the site frequency spectrum between the X-chromosome and autosomes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) and in the enrichment of long haplotype blocks on the X-chromosome (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Since many of these long X-linked haplotype blocks are fixed in all five lab strains, the fixation of hemizygous loci likely occurred early in fly domestication.</p>

        <title>Preferential role for neurogenetic genes</title>
        <p>Our results suggest a central role for neurogenetic genes in domestication. Lab-specific SNPs found in the majority of lab strains are strongly enriched for this functional class, as are highly differentiated SNPs found in high frequency in the wild (Fst*<sub>wild&gt;lab</sub> SNPs; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S3). Large outlier haplotype blocks also contain an overrepresentation of neurogenetic genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Table S4). In most fly labs, inadvertent selection is inevitable: more active, reactive, and sensory-prone flies (and their alleles) have a higher probability of escaping during routine stock transfers. Hence, fly researchers may have unconsciously selected for lethargic flies over thousands of generations in the lab. Selected genes, enriched for sensory functions in eye photoreceptors and peripheral nervous system, can explain these behavioral shifts seen in lab strains. The significance of neurogenetic genes in changing activity and response behaviors across a relatively short evolutionary time period may also relate to how behaviors involved in premating isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] can swiftly and easily develop in a population by drift and selection.</p>
        <p>Recently, Wilkins et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] proposed a general hypothesis to explain the convergence of various phenotypic traits that differentiate mammalian domesticates from their wild progenitors. These traits are collectively known as the “domestication syndrome” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and, in mammals, include such morphological modifications as depigmentation, facial skeletal, and floppy ears as well as behavioral shifts towards docility and tameness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Wilkins et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] argue that a developmental deficit in neural crest genes can generate each of these differences, thus, explaining the commonality of these traits across domesticated mammals. Our results extend the behavioral component of the domestication syndrome to non-vertebrates but through a more general genomic mechanism based on the predominance of mutations on neurogenetic genes affecting overall locomotion and activity. In Drosophila, genes from this ontological category are among the largest in gene number and gene size, providing a large mutational target for rapid behavioral change (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Figure S5). Currently, 1,708 out of 17,716 genes are characterized as “neurogenetic” (according to FlyBase R6.05), and 24 % of known fly genes are expressed in the brain and nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. We propose that a large mutational target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] of neurogenetic genes can explain the rapid evolution of behavior in animal taxa., These neurogenomic loci collectively provide a large genomic substrate for variation to accumulate, and then selection and drift to act, to quickly transform behavior within a relatively short time frame.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Tameness and docility are hallmark features of domestication and the product of artificial selection by breeders. Our results challenge the traditional notion that relatively submissive laboratory animals are solely the product of cumulating deleterious mutations and demonstrate how unconscious selection for human-favored traits plays an important role in driving rapid phenotypic change in the lab. Selection on a large pool of available genetic variation during the early stages of fly domestication, followed by strong and recurrent inbreeding, allow for the successive roles of adaptation and drift in shaping the genetic architecture of domesticated phenotypic traits in a bottle. Our study finds that the genes and phenotypes in fruit fly domestication are enriched in, respectively, neurogenetic and behavioral function, providing a starting point to decode the genomic basis of domestication and promoting its study in genetic model systems such as Drosophila. A detailed mapping of these genes and their SNPs to specific behaviors will not only be informative about the selective pressures that we have inadvertently applied to our immediate biotic environment, but may also provide new general insight on the divergence and isolation of populations.</p>

        <p>Locomotory assays were performed separately on five lines of adult <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (6–8 days post-eclosion), each of North American origin. Three lines (Canton-S, w<sup>1118</sup>, and Oregon-R) represent common laboratory stocks originally extracted from nature at least seventy years ago (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Two wild-caught lines were collected from Linvilla PA and Lancaster MA and reared under normal laboratory conditions for less than one year without specific selective regimes (courtesy of the Schmidt lab, University of Pennsylvania). Stocks were maintained in the laboratory at ~24 C, at ~40 % relative humidity, kept in standard 250 ml bottles on Lewis food medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], and exposed to a 12 h light–dark cycle. Prior to behavioral assays, flies are anesthetized with light CO<sub>2</sub> sedation (&lt;15 s) for transfer and identification, and allowed to acclimatize in the arena setting for 30 min, post-sedation. Assays are conducted in Delrin arenas (McMaster-Carr) following specifications outlined in Simon and Dickinson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] to optimize mobility and provide an effective environment for automated tracking. To prevent locomotion on the ceilings, glass covers are coated with Sigmacote (Sigma Aldrich). Between assays, arenas are rinsed with ethanol and allowed to dry for a minimum of 15 min to ensure no residues remain from previous behavioral experiments.</p>
        <p>Assays are conducted during active afternoon periods across successive days. Each line is recorded using three independent replicates per line tested on different days and randomized to reduce experimental bias. Fly activity, post-acclimation, is recorded for 30 min. Individual and interactive activities are tracked using CTRAX and MATLAB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Errors in the initial tracking are corrected using CTRAX’s <italic>Fix errors</italic> scripts. All output measurements are analyzed using MATLAB and statistics implemented using custom R scripts.</p>

Illumina 150 bp paired-end reads from Canton-S and w<sup>1118</sup> were obtained from the Hawley lab (Stowers Institute). Reference assemblies were generated by aligning filtered reads against the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome following methods described by Lack et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], an assembly pipeline that adds an intermediate realignment step for the purpose of aligning reads around insertion and deletion sites. Briefly, paired-end reads were aligned using BWA v0.7.12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] against the complete <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> reference genome (<italic>Dmel</italic> Release 5) obtained from FlyBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flybase.org/">flybase.org</ext-link>). Post-alignment files were transformed using SAMtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and Picard v1.79 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>). Bases are filtered for a minimum quality score of 30 and a minimum read depth of 15x from VCF files generated by the Genome Analysis Toolkit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Table S5 includes a brief summary of the raw data.</p>
        <p>To identify mutational states in the lab, 516 full genome assemblies from natural populations of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> were downloaded from the Drosophila Genome Nexus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] representing 23 countries from Africa, Europe, and North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Genome-genome alignment of <italic>D. simulans</italic> R2 assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] against the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> R5 assembly was performed using Progressive Mauve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] using default parameters. To validate the quality of our alignment, the average number of nucleotide substitutions (Dxy; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]) was estimated for 100 kb non-overlapping windows (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Figure S6) and genome-wide patterns compared to previous literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p>

        <title>Genomic filters and annotations</title>
        <p>All genomic analyses were restricted to euchromatic chromosome arms (2L, 2R, 3L, 3R, X). To minimize sampling biases, the combined dataset was subjected to coverage filters for missing data. For a particular site to be used, a minimum 75 % of the laboratory strains (<italic>n</italic> &gt; 3) and a minimum of 75 % of the population samples (<italic>n</italic> ≥ 388) must contain a non-ambiguous nucleotide, with no more than two alleles present (i.e., only monoallelic and diallelic sites were included). SNPs are identified across all filtered base pairs, with singletons from global populations excluded to conservatively reduce the effects of sequencing error from low-coverage global samples. Data were also filtered for the presence of a <italic>D. simulans</italic> allele to infer ancestral state<italic>.</italic> After filtering for data quality, coverage, and ancestral state, 98,442,787 eligible sites (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>: Table S6) were used to identify SNPs differentiated between the lab and wild.</p>
        <p>We identify several types of derived mutations: SNPs unique to lab strains and SNPs significantly differentiated between lab stains and the wild. Derived SNPs uniquely found in labs (i.e., the lab strain(s) possess a base neither present in known global populations of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> nor <italic>D. simulans</italic>) are classified as “lab-specific” SNPs. Highly differentiated SNPs, often shared across both lab and wild samples, were identified via Hudson’s F<sub>ST</sub> estimator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] with F<sub>ST</sub> scores Z-transformed as follows: Z-F<sub>ST</sub> = (F<sub>ST</sub> - μF<sub>ST</sub>)/σF<sub>ST</sub>. SNPs with F<sub>ST</sub> estimates harboring a Z-score &gt; 2.5 were considered highly differentiated (Fst*) SNPs. Fst* SNPs are further classified as either: i) “Fst*<sub>lab&gt;wild</sub>” if the derived allele is found at a higher frequency in the lab, or ii) “Fst*<sub>wild&gt;lab</sub>” if the derived allele is higher in frequency in the wild. Both lab-specific and Fst* SNPs can be further categorized as polymorphic (1/5,…4/5) or fixed (5/5, or 4/4 in the case of missing data) with respect to their frequency among the five sequenced lab strains.</p>
        <p>SNPs are annotated by genomic location (e.g., genic <italic>vs</italic>. inter-genic) using FlyBase R5.9. SNPs located within a gene model, represented by their longest transcript, are further classified according to their annotated position within a gene model (5’UTR, exon, intron, 3’UTR), and their codon position (C1, C2, C3) if found within an exon. SNPs found within exonic regions are also classified as non-synonymous or synonymous. The relative fitness of each amino acid substitution is estimated using a Grantham score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], which evaluates biochemical dissimilarity (based on polarity, amino acid size, and side chain composition) between ancestral and derived states, with lower Grantham scores indicating a greater biochemical similarity. Synonymous codon shifts are categorized into four separate classes (P2P, preferred codon &gt; preferred codon; P2N, preferred codon &gt; non-preferred codon; N2P, non-preferred codon &gt; preferred codon; N2N, non-preferred codon &gt; non-preferred codon) according to the classification of Vicario et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].</p>

        <title>Detecting selective signals</title>
        <p>To determine whether selection is acting in the lab, we compared evolutionary patterns of coding region variation in lab-specific SNPs against: i) a North American population comprising of 205 DGRP genomes from Raleigh NC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] and ii) neutral expectations. Since negative and positive selection differentially affects the site frequency spectrum, we bin these differentiated SNPs according to their shared frequency among lab strains: with five strains, the site frequency spectrum is divided into fifths.</p>
        <p>To generate neutrally simulated data, <italic>n</italic> mutations, based on the number of SNPs found in the CDS of lab strains, are randomly assigned to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> coding regions. SNPs within CDS regions are labeled according to their codon position (C1, C2, C3) and classified as a non-synonymous or synonymous substitution with synonymous SNPs classified as preferred or non-preferred codons. A simple model of equal probability of changing any position within the codon to another nucleotide is applied. 1000 simulations are performed. After binning these simulated data into the five allele frequency classes, we estimate basic evolutionary parameters including mean Grantham score of amino acid substitutions, proportion of non-synonymous SNPs, fraction of polymorphisms in 1<sup>st</sup> codon position, and shifts in codon preference. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] are used to compare these neutral estimates, as well as those from the North Carolina population (<italic>n</italic> = 205), against parameter estimates from the lab strains (<italic>n</italic> = 5).</p>
        <p>Recent domestication studies have surveyed genomic regions for significantly reduced heterozygosity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] to identify selectively swept candidate genes. However, heterozygosity is rare, if not absent, in isogenic strains of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (data not shown). For each SNP, we estimate the mean population (i.e., laboratory) haplotype length conditioned on frequency class. Haplotype length analyses are performed using custom perl scripts allowing for non-congruent haplotypes to extend from each lab-specific SNP. Due to the lower sequencing coverage of lab strains, a maximum of one individual per site is permitted to have missing data. Large outlier haplotype blocks are identified by a Z-hap score &gt; 2.5.</p>

        <title>Phylogenetic and functional enrichment analyses</title>
        <p>To understand the topological relationship among lab strains, neighbor-joining trees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] are generated using p-distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] and bootstrapped 1,000 times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] for laboratory-specific and high F<sub>st</sub>* (Fst*<sub>lab&gt;wild</sub> + Fst*<sub>wild&gt;lab</sub>) SNP sets. To evaluate the topologies between lab strains and extant populations, 100,000 SNPs that are shared in lab and nature were randomly chosen for NJ tree analysis and bootstrapped 1,000 times using MEGA6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Overrepresented gene ontologies for differentiated SNPs are identified using DAVID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] and FlyMine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Gene sets are weighted according to the size of their categories and a False Discovery Rate (FDR) is used to correct for the deployment of multiple tests. For selected enrichment analyses, gene lengths were used to normalize the potential impact of genes from certain GO categories covering a disproportionate fraction of the genome. Gene annotation data for tissue specificity and ontogenetic stages are characterized using FlyAtlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>].</p>

          <p>Keio University and affiliated hospitals established an observational COPD cohort.

          <p>A total of 443 patients comprising 252 patients aged &lt;75 years and 191 patients aged ≥75 years, were enrolled. Emphysematous changes on CT and prevalence of possible pulmonary hypertension were greater in late-elderly patients. The slope of the relationship between CT emphysema densitometry score and forced expiratory volume in 1 s was significantly less steep in the late-elderly than the younger patients (p = 0.002). CAT and total SGRQ scores and the frequency of long-term oxygen therapy were significantly higher in the late-elderly with moderate airflow obstruction compared to those of the younger in the same grade, although the opposite was seen in late-elderly patients with very severe airflow obstruction. Hypertension, aortic aneurysm, prostatic hypertrophy, anemia, and cataract are more prevalent in late-elderly patients.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), one of the most prevalent health conditions, is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. COPD morbidity and mortality have been increasing in many countries, in part due to an aging population world-wide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. By the mid-21st century, the chance of living beyond 60 years will be 98 % in Japan/Oceania, 82 % in Western Europe, and 69 % in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Relative to the 2011 world population, recent United Nations projections estimate that by 2100 the number of people aged &gt;60 years will triple, with an eightfold increase in those &gt;80 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, although increases in life expectancy and the size of the elderly population during the past several decades might explain the current increase in COPD, the relationship may be more complex, including factors such as differential susceptibility to tobacco, anatomic and systemic differences, behavioral differences, and differences in response to available therapeutic modalities.</p>
      <p>Japan is a super-aged society, ranked first in the world. The late elderly (aged ≥75 years) accounted for 11.6 % of Japan’s population in the 2010 national population census. In recent years pulmonary and primary care physicians in Japan have been more ready to diagnose and treat COPD patients of advanced age, and although it is known that COPD currently mostly affects middle-aged and elderly people, few studies have focused on how the features of COPD differ by age.</p>
      <p>In the past, COPD severity was simply classified based upon the % forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>), because it was believed that the majority of patients followed a path of disease progression in which the severity of the disease tracked the severity of the airflow limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, it has become clear in recent years that comprehensive assessment requires more than FEV<sub>1</sub> measurement. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has proposed an assessment for COPD treatment based on the patient’s level of symptoms and future risk of exacerbation, in addition to the severity of spirometric abnormality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Very elderly patients with COPD may present differently from younger ones; they may have a different pattern of comorbidities, and a different survival rate after acute exacerbations. Physicians may also have an age bias that may affect both diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of this study was thus to examine the characteristics of COPD patients aged 75 and over compared with those aged below 75.</p>

        <title>Study populations</title>
        <p>Keio University and affiliated hospitals have established an observational COPD cohort, registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN000003470), for investigations of the management of COPD comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. All patients were clinically stable without exacerbations for at least 1 month prior to study. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committees of Keio University on July 29, 2009 (No. 20090008) and the affiliated hospitals, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient.</p>

      <sec id="Sec4">
        <title>Measurement of pulmonary functions</title>
        <p>All participants underwent spirometry when in a stable condition during the baseline examination, according to ATS protocols using an electronic spirometer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Predicted values were derived from the guidelines for pulmonary function tests issued by the Japanese Respiratory Society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The classification of disease severity was based on GOLD spirometric grading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], Grade I: mild (FEV<sub>1</sub>/forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt;0.70, %FEV<sub>1</sub> ≥80 %), Grade II: moderate (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &lt;0.70, %FEV<sub>1</sub> 50–80 %), Grade III: severe (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &lt;0.70, %FEV<sub>1</sub> 30–50 %) and Grade IV: very severe COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &lt;0.70, %FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;30 %).</p>

        <title>Assessment of clinical parameters</title>
        <p>At enrollment, a full medical and smoking history and current pharmacological treatment were obtained and clinical examinations were performed. Comorbid diagnoses were established using clinical history and examination findings, supported by a review of available medical records. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used, with a cut-off score of 11 points each for a probable status of anxiety or depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms were evaluated using a self-reported Frequency Scale for the Symptoms of GERD (FSSG) questionnaire, consisting of 12 items, with a cut-off score of 8 points for GERD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec6">
        <title>Questionnaires on health-related quality of life (QOL)</title>
        <p>Each patient’s health-related QOL was evaluated using three questionnaires. Two were disease-specific: the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The CAT has been validated in Japan using the same population enrolled in the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36-Item (SF-36) version 2 was also used to measure the patients’ general health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and it was reported that COPD patients have SF-36 lower scores, representing worse health-related QOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. All of the questionnaires were completed by the patients themselves, at home, in the stable state.</p>

        <title>Evaluation of emphysema on CT scan</title>
        <p>Quantitative High Resolution computed tomography (HRCT) analyses of emphysema were performed. Low-attenuation areas (LAAs) using a threshold level of −950 HU were determined using a Discovery CT 750HD CT system (GE Healthcare, Tokyo), adjusting the threshold on each model of CT scan using a CT scanner test object, the Multipurpose Chest Phantom N1 “Lungman” (Kyoto Kagaku, Kyoto, Japan) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and calculated its percentage relative to the entire lung area (LAA%) using the workstation Lexus 64<sup>®</sup> (AZE Ltd., Tokyo) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec8">
        <title>Echocardiographic evaluation</title>
        <p>Echocardiograms were obtained using two commercially available echocardiography systems (GE Vivid7/Vivid9, GE Healthcare, Horten, Norway and iE33/Sonos7500, Philips; Amsterdam, Netherlands). A 2.5-MHz transducer was used to obtain the images in the parasternal and apical views, corresponding to the standard long-axis, and two-chamber and four-chamber images, respectively. Standard two-dimensional and color Doppler data were collected. The estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (eSPAP) was calculated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and pulmonary arterial hypertension was defined by an eSPAP ≥35 mmHg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>

Comparisons of data among the four patient groups were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by a Tukey–Kramer post hoc analysis. Comorbidities were included as a categorical variable. A χ<sup>2</sup> analysis was conducted to compare the frequencies between two groups. Relationships between quantitative data were examined using Spearman tests. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were conducted to examine whether the slope of the relationship between two parameters differed between the patients aged &lt;75 and ≥75 years. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. All data were analyzed using the JMP version 9.0.2 software for Windows.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Japan became a super-aged society before other countries, but this trend is present in all developed and in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The results of the present study suggest that COPD patients surviving to become late-elderly have a different pattern of lung function disturbance and emphysema to those who are younger. Although a strong correlation of emphysema on CT scan with spirometry was found in a large-scale cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the severity of emphysema varies widely even among patients with the same grade of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], our data suggests that age may be a factor in that variation. One of the problems in comparing different ages of COPD patients is the reliability of estimates of normal ranges for FEV<sub>1</sub> in the late-elderly. VC and FEV<sub>1</sub> are thought to decline linearly with age; this being the basis of equations for calculating predicted values based on age. In the present study, late-elderly COPD patients showed lower VC and FEV<sub>1</sub> values compared to those in the younger patients, but they were classified in the same grade of COPD based on percentage of predicted values. These observations imply that VC and FEV<sub>1</sub> were similarly reduced by age across the grades of airflow limitation in patients with COPD to those in the Japanese general population. The less steep slope of the relationship between emphysema and FEV<sub>1</sub> shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> may be due to a healthy survivor effect (late elderly patients with severe airflow limitation being more likely to die), but relationships between the severities of airflow limitation and emphysema can be different in the late-elderly and younger patients with COPD.</p>
      <p>We compared health-related QOL using the CAT, SGRQ and SF-36 between the two groups at different levels of airflow limitation. Overall there was a weak but generally consistent trend towards patients with more severe airflow limitation having worse QOL. To the authors’ best knowledge, no previous studies have focused on the age-related differences of health-related QOL in patients with COPD. Age negatively affects physical function, physical role limitations and general health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and our study reports similar findings, although we have shown that late-elderly patients in GOLD IV have better health status than younger patients. This may reflect a healthy survival effect, since the proportion of late elderly patients GOLD IV who were on LTOT was much lower than in the younger patients with the same degree of airflow limitation. This conclusion was supported by the data on pulmonary hypertension, since for any given degree of airflow limitation, the late-elderly patients were more likely to have pulmonary hypertension, except in GOLD IV. We have previously reported that comorbid diseases such as depression, anxiety, and GERD may increase CAT scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, there was no difference in the prevalence of such comorbidities between the late-elderly and younger patients. In contrast age-related comorbid diseases including hypertension, aortic aneurysm, prostatic hypertrophy, anemia, and cataract were not associated with CAT scores in the present study (data not shown).</p>
      <p>One of the strengths of our cohort study is that the study population is a community-living sample. The patients enrolled provide a representative range of the socio-economic characteristics of COPD patients in Japan, registered at a general clinical practice, a university hospital or a related facility. Coincidentally, other COPD cohort studies conducted in different Japanese locality investigated participants with a similar average age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Indeed, COPD patients in Japan are typically elderly, and there might be a “healthy survivor effect” in their late seventies and beyond. We speculate that these older-aged COPD cohorts contain a higher proportion of people who, for whatever reasons, did not experience such serious or life-threatening comorbid problems as their younger peers. We have no reason to believe that the pattern seen in these COPD patients is a particularly Japanese phenomenon.</p>
      <p>As COPD is more prevalent at older ages, it represents an increasing problem for public healthcare worldwide. Few studies have reported the clinical features of COPD in very elderly patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and the need for more research into the impact of age on this growing subpopulation of COPD patients is urgent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Our study identified late-elderly COPD patients with moderate airflow limitation who manifested severe emphysema and/or pulmonary hypertension, and disabling dyspnea that were not usually complicating features of COPD patients with moderate airflow limitation for the younger patients. In part this may be because the conventional %FEV<sub>1</sub> staging scheme may be misleading as a measure of severity in late-elderly patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. An alternative staging strategy that accounted for age-related changes in pulmonary function and variability in spirometric performance, i.e., the lambda-mu-sigma method, demonstrated that 28.1 % of patients with severe COPD were classified as moderate using the standard GOLD grades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
      <p>One limitation of this study is the lack of age-matched healthy controls for comparison, although that is complicated by the fact that the elderly often live with one or more chronic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Another limitation is that the objective quantification of emphysema severity and pulmonary hypertension was not assessed for all of the enrolled subjects, because we had to use different types of CT scanners and echocardiography systems in each affiliated hospital. Finally, this study mainly consisted of male patients (91.6 %), and further investigations are necessary to test whether our observations are applicable to female COPD patients.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>The present study demonstrates that very elderly individuals present a different pattern of COPD than younger patients. This is possibly the result of different pathways of disease coupled with a healthy survivor effect. Assessments of COPD severity from a multidimensional perspective are essential for the appropriate attribution of symptoms and use of COPD-directed therapies. The results of the present study further strengthen the need for a better assessment of airflow limitation in late-elderly patients than current FEV<sub>1</sub> prediction values and late-elderly COPD patients warrant specific attention in clinical practice.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>There is limited longitudinal data available on the natural history of meniscal tears especially in middle-aged adults with a low prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of this study was to describe the natural history of meniscal tears over 8 years and the relationship with change in knee pain and structures.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>One hundred ninety eight participants [mean age 47 (28–63); 57 % female] were studied at baseline and 8 years later. Approximately half were the adult offspring of subjects who had a knee replacement performed for knee OA and the remainder were randomly selected controls. Meniscal tears/extrusion, cartilage volume/defects, bone marrow lesions (BMLs) and effusion were assessed on MRI. Knee pain was assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>22 % of the participants had at least one meniscal tear at any site at baseline. Over 8 years, 16 % of the participants had an increase in severity of meniscal tears while none improved. Increase in meniscal tear score was associated with worsening knee pain (β = +2.81 (+1.40, +4.22)), with offspring having a significantly greater increase in pain severity compared to controls. BMI and presence of osteophytes at baseline, but not knee injury, predicted change in tears, whereas change in meniscal tears was independently associated with cartilage volume loss, change in BMLs and change in meniscal extrusion.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Change in meniscal tears shares risk factors with knee OA and is independently associated with worsening knee pain and structural damage suggesting that meniscal tears are on the knee OA causal pathway.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Loss of meniscal function due to tears is a potent risk factor for knee osteoarthritis (OA) and may be one of the earliest changes in the OA causal pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Meniscal tears share common risk factors with knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and explain more of the variation in joint space narrowing (JSN) than cartilage volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Cross-sectional studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have also shown that damage to menisci in the form of tears is paralleled by other structural abnormalities such as lower cartilage volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and an increased severity of cartilage defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and bone marrow lesions (BMLs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although meniscal tears are a common finding in people with asymptomatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], it is a potential source of pain associated with OA. The periphery of menisci have nociceptive innervation and it is reasonable to hypothesise that meniscal tears that extend to this area can cause pain. However longitudinal studies, conducted over 15–24 months, have shown conflicting results thus far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is uncertain if change in meniscal tears is directly associated with worsening pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] or if both meniscal damage and pain are a result of OA through intermediate pathologies (such as BMLs and effusion) rather than a direct link between the two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is limited longitudinal data on the natural history of meniscal tears. It is not clear how meniscal tears change over a long period of time and how change in meniscal tears is associated with global knee structural changes. The aim of this study was to describe the natural history of meniscal tears over 8 years, the predictors of change in meniscal tears and the association between change in meniscal tears and change in knee pain and structures.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>This study was conducted as part of the Offspring study, a population-based study that began in Southern Tasmania in June 2000. Matched sampling was used to recruit the study participants (mean-age 47 (28–63) years; 57 % females). Half of the participants were the adult offspring of patients (only one parent) who had a knee replacement performed for idiopathic knee OA at any Hobart hospital from 1996 to 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The diagnosis was confirmed by reference to the medical records of the orthopaedic surgeons and the original radiographs when possible. The other half were age and sex matched controls, randomly selected from the population with no history of knee OA in either parent. This study includes data from the first (visit-2) and second (visit-3) follow-up visits at approximately two and ten years respectively, as we did not have the correct MRI sequence to score meniscal tears at baseline.</p>
      <p>All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. The Southern Tasmanian Health and Medical Human Research Ethics Committee approved the protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p>
      <p>Participants were excluded if they had a contraindication to MRI (including metal sutures, presence of shrapnel, iron filing in eye, or claustrophobia). Participants were also excluded if they had undergone a knee replacement surgery or did so after the commencement of the study. Knee pain and knee injury were not a basis for exclusion.</p>
      <sec id="Sec3">
        <title>Knee pain</title>
        <p>Knee pain was assessed by self-administered questionnaire using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) at both visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Five categories of pain (walking on flat surface, going up or down stairs, at night, sitting or lying, and standing upright) were assessed separately with a 10-point scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe pain). Each category was summed to create a total pain score (range 0 to 50). Furthermore, the five categories were clinically categorized into weight-bearing pain (including walking on flat surface, going up or down stairs and standing) and non-weight-bearing pain (including pain at night and sitting or lying).</p>

      <sec id="Sec4">
        <title>Knee joint injury</title>
        <p>History of knee joint injury was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] which included the following questions:<disp-quote><p>“Have you ever had a previous knee injury which resulted in non-weight bearing treatment for 24 h or more?”</p><p>“If yes, then which knee?”</p><p>“Please provide further details about the injury”</p></disp-quote></p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec5">
        <title>Magnetic resonance imaging</title>
        <p>MRI of the right knee was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Knees were imaged in the sagittal plane on a 1.5-T whole-body magnetic resonance unit (Picker International, USA) using a commercial transmit-receive extremity coil. The following image sequence was used: (1) a T1-weighted fat-suppressed 3D gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state, flip angle 55°, repetition time 58 msec, echo time 12 msec, field of view 16 cm, 60 partitions, 512 × 512–pixel matrix, slice thickness of 1.5 mm without an interslice-gap; and (2) a T2-weighted fat saturation 2D fast spin echo, flip angle 90°, repetition time 3067 ms, echo time 112 ms, field of view 16 cm, 15 partitions, 256 × 256 matrix, slice thickness of 4 mm with an interslice gap of 0.5–1.0 mm.</p>

        <title>Meniscal tears</title>
        <p>Meniscal tears were assessed by a trained observer (musculoskeletal radiologist with several years of experience) on T2-weighted fat saturated (side by side) MR images at visit-2 and 3 of the study as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The proportion of the menisci affected by a tear was scored separately (0–2 scale; 0 = absence of a tear, 1 = simple tear of different types: longitudinal, oblique, radial or horizontal, 2 = macerated tear signifying loss &gt; 50 % area of meniscal tissue) at the anterior, middle, and posterior horns. Anterior, middle and posterior scores were summed to create medial and lateral meniscal tear scores. The intra- and inter-observer correlation coefficient (expressed as intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)) ranged from 0.86 to 0.96 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec7">
        <title>Meniscal extrusion</title>
        <p>The extent of meniscal extrusion on the medial or lateral edges of the tibial femoral joint space, not including the osteophytes, was evaluated at visit-2 and 3 for the anterior, body, and posterior horns of the menisci on T1-weighted gradient echo MR images, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A score from 0 to 2 was used (0 = no extrusion, 1 = partial meniscal extrusion, and 2 = complete meniscal extrusion with no contact with the joint space). The scores of anterior, body and posterior horns of medial or lateral menisci were summed to create a total meniscal extrusion score for each of the medial and lateral tibiofemoral compartments which had a possible range from 0 to 6. The intra- and inter-observer correlation coefficient ranged from 0.85 to 0.92 for meniscal extrusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
        <p>All knees were evaluated for the presence of meniscal extrusion regardless of whether they had a meniscal tear or not.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec8">
        <title>Cartilage volume</title>
        <p>Tibial and femoral cartilage volume was assessed on T1-weighted gradient echo MR images using Osiris (University of Geneva, Switzerland) and Cartiscope (ArthroLab, Montreal, Canada) software respectively at visit-2 and 3, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The coefficient of variation (CV) for intra-observer repeatability ranged from 2.0–2.2 % for both tibial and femoral cartilage volume measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Total cartilage volume was calculated as: tibial + femoral cartilage volume.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec9">
        <title>Cartilage defects</title>
        <p>Cartilage defects were assessed on T1-weighted gradient echo MR images on a 0–4 scale (0 = normal; 1 = focal blistering/signal changes; 2 = &lt;50 % thickness loss; 3= &gt; 50 % thickness loss; 4 = full thickness defect) at visit-2 and 3, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Intraobserver reliability ranged from ICC of 0.89–0.90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Interobserver reliability was assessed in 50 MR images and yielded an ICC of 0.85–0.90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec10">
        <title>Bone marrow lesions</title>
        <p>BMLs were assessed on T2-weighted fat saturated MR images at visit-2 and 3 and were defined as areas of increased signal adjacent to the subchondral bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. One trained observer scored the BMLs by measuring the maximum area of the lesion in a specific compartment. The observer manually selected the MRI slice with the greatest BML size. The BML with the highest score was used if more than one lesion was present at the same site. The ICC for intra-observer reliability, assessed on 40 MR images, was 0.97.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec11">
        <title>Effusion</title>
        <p>Effusion was assessed in the supra-patellar pouch on T2-weighted fat saturated MR images at visit-2 and 3 on a 0–3 scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Grade-0 signified absence of fluid over the upper margin of the patella in a sagittal image; Grade-1 signified some fluid above the upper margin of the patella but the length of the fluid column shorter than that of the patella; Grade-2 signified a fluid column above the upper margin of patella longer than the length of the patella; Grade-3 signified a fluid column above the upper margin of patella longer than the length of the patella with a thickness of ≥ 1 cm. Intra-observer reliability was assessed in 50 MR images and yielded an ICC of 0.89–0.98. Pathological effusion was defined as any effusion score ≥2.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec12">
        <title>Radiography</title>
        <p>A standing anteroposterior semiflexed view of the right knee (at 15° flexion) was performed in all participants at baseline and 10 years. Radiographs were scored individually for osteophytes and joint space narrowing, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Each of the following four features was scored on a scale from 0 to 3 (0 = normal and 3 = severe): medial joint space narrowing (JSN), lateral JSN, medial osteophytes (femoral and tibial combined) and lateral osteophytes (femoral and tibial combined). Each score was arrived at by consensus with two readers simultaneously assessing the radiograph with immediate reference to the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A non-zero score in either joint space narrowing or osteophytosis was regarded as evidence of radiographic osteoarthritis (ROA). Reproducibility was assessed in 50 radiographs, two weeks apart, and yielded an ICC of 0.99 for osteophytes and 0.98 for JSN.</p>
        <p>Readers for all the scans were either musculoskeletal radiologists with several years of experience in OA research or health professionals trained by musculoskeletal radiologists. Readers were not blinded to the chronological sequence of the radiographs and MRI scans.</p>

Linear regression analysis was used to describe the association between change in meniscal tears and change in pain, cartilage volume loss and change in BMLs. Multivariable analyses were adjusted for demographics, body mass index (BMI), offspring-control status and knee structures (global knee structural factors known to be associated with the presence of meniscal tears or knee pain). Further analysis was performed to explore any offspring-control interaction in the multivariable models for all the above mentioned associations.</p>
          <p>A P-value of less than 0.05 (two-tailed) was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed on Intercooled Stata 12.0 for windows (StataCorp LP).</p>

        <p>Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> describes the prevalence of meniscal tears at visit-2. 22 % of the participants (44/198) had at least one meniscal tear at any site. 41/44 participants had at least one meniscal tear at any of the three meniscal sites (anterior, body or posterior) in the medial compartment, whereas only 3 participants had at least one meniscal tear in the lateral compartment. None of the participants had a meniscal tear in both compartments.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Prevalence and natural history of meniscal tears. <bold>a</bold> Prevalence of meniscal tears at visit 2; <bold>b</bold> Site-specific distribution of meniscal tears at visit 2</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12891_2015_862_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
        <p>Forty one participants with medial meniscal tears had 55 meniscal tears in total at all sites. 29/41 participants had a single meniscal tear at any site (anterior, body or posterior), 10/41 participants had a meniscal tear at 2 sites and 2/41 participants had a meniscal tear at all 3 sites. Medial posterior was the most commonly affected site (27/55), followed by medial body (21/55) and medial anterior sites (7/55) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). 37/55 meniscal tears were simple tears, whereas 18/55 were macerated tears.</p>
        <p>Three participants with lateral meniscal tears had 8 meniscal tears in total at all sites. 1/3 participant had a meniscal tear at 2 sites and 2/3 participants had meniscal tears at all 3 sites. Lateral posterior was the most commonly affected site (4/8), followed by lateral body (3/8) and lateral anterior sites (1/8) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). 5/8 meniscal tears were simple tears, whereas 3/8 were macerated tears.</p>
        <p>The majority of participant’s menisci (84 %) remained stable over 8 years. 16 % of the participants (31/198) showed an increase in mean meniscal score—including incident tears (14/31) and increase in the severity of existing tears (17/31). Most of these changes affected the medial meniscus (87 % (27/31)).</p>
        <p>Most of the participants showed an increase at the posterior meniscal site (15/31), followed by body (12/31) and anterior (4/31) sites. None of the participants with a meniscal tear at visit-2 showed an improvement in meniscal tear score over 8 years.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study documents the natural history of meniscal tears over 8 years. In this midlife cohort meniscal tears were common with 22 % of the participants suffering from at least one. 16 % of the participants showed an increase in severity and none improved over 8 years. BMI and osteophytes independently predicted an increase in meniscal tears over 8 years. Change in meniscal tears was independently associated with an increase in knee pain severity, with offspring showing a greater increase in the severity of pain per unit change in meniscal tears compared to the control group. Change in meniscal tears was independently associated with cartilage volume loss, change in BMLs and meniscal extrusion over 8 years.</p>
      <p>Majority of the meniscal tears (55/63) at visit-2 affected the medial meniscus. Medial posterior site showed the highest prevalence followed my medial body sites. Previous studies by Englund et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] in older adults and by K. A Beattie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] in middle-aged adults showed a similar distribution in cross-sectional studies as well. Although the majority of the menisci remained stable over the course of 8 years, 16 % showed an increase in severity over time. Again medial posterior was the most commonly affected site for both incident meniscal tears and worsening meniscal tear grades. Of note, none of the meniscal tears improved over the course of the study, unlike other knee structures such as BMLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and cartilage defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] as previously shown in this cohort. Previously Dillon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] followed 22 patients with 27 intra-meniscal lesions with signal intensity changes on MRI but no tears on arthroscopy. After 27 months only 2 completely disappeared. Similarly Boegard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], followed 47 patients and found that only 2 meniscal tears out of 54 improved and none disappeared over 2 years. Meniscal tears, unlike other knee structures, do not seem to have the capacity to regenerate or improve over time. Slight discrepancies in the above mentioned studies could be due different populations, a longer follow-up period resulting in less measurement error in the present study and a possibly a more severe disease process in the offspring sub-group.</p>
      <p>High BMI was the most consistent independent risk factor for increase in meniscal tear severity. A previous cross-sectional study from the present cohort showed that a higher BMI is positively associated with prevalent meniscal tears [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Our findings are consistent with Baker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] but differ from Englund et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], who found a significant association between BMI and meniscal extrusion but not tears. A recent meta-analysis examining risk factors for meniscal tears concluded that a high BMI is a moderate risk factor for developing meniscal tears along with occupational and recreational joint loading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Osteophytes at visit-1 also predicted worsening of meniscal tears. Osteophytes are thought to be an early instigating factor in the OA causal pathway and their true prevalence is under estimated on radiographs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Beattie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] showed, using peripheral MRI, that many peripheral osteophytes are missed by standard radiographs and their presence corresponds with degenerative meniscal changes at the same site. Presence of osteophytes in our study also showed a significant association with change in meniscal tears at the peripheries (anterior and posterior) and not at the meniscal body site. Interestingly, history of knee injury was not independently associated with meniscal tear increase. Previously, Englund et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] have shown that history of knee injury is a strong risk factor for developing meniscal tears but they did not adjust for potential confounders. Similarly, we found a significant association between knee injury and meniscal tears in unadjusted analysis but this association did not persist in the fully adjusted model. These findings suggest that the changes in meniscal tears are not due to mechanical factors only and are mainly a part of an active osteoarthritic process.</p>
      <p>Previously in this cohort, we showed a cross-sectional association between presence of meniscal tears and increased pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In a longitudinal study, Zanetti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] found that asymptomatic participants with a meniscal tear are more likely to develop knee pain than participants without one. Englund et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] on the other hand concluded that any association between meniscal damage and knee pain seems to be present because both pain and meniscal damage are related to OA and not because of a direct link between the two. Our study is the first study to show an independent longitudinal association between increasing severity of meniscal tears and worsening pain, including pain on all individual WOMAC sub-scales, as well as both weight bearing and non-weight bearing pain. Previous studies have also suggested that meniscal tears appear to cause symptoms only when macerated tears extrude and damage collateral ligaments or when bone marrow abnormalities are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Results in this study were independent of change in meniscal extrusion and BMLs as well as localised inflammation as assessed by knee effusion, suggesting meniscal tears may be one of the most important knee structures in relation to pain.</p>
      <p>Every unit increase in meniscal tears in the offspring group resulted in a greater increase in pain compared to the controls. Previously in this cohort, we found similar differences between the two groups when looking at the association between change in BMLs and pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A possible explanation could be the differences in the pain perception pathways of the two groups. Of note, polymorphisms in COMT and TRPV1 genes have recently been identified which could alter the processing of nociceptive pain associated with OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Another possible explanation could be that meniscal pathology in the offspring is morphologically different but this could not be differentiated on MRI.</p>
      <p>Biomechanical studies have shown that the function of the meniscus is to reduce contact stress by enlarging the contact surface and shock absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Meniscal function can be either lost due to meniscal tears or meniscal extrusion. Meniscal tears, especially macerated tears, are a possible risk factor for meniscal extrusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and findings from this study confirm this. Loss of meniscal function can potentially damage articular cartilage and sub-chondral bone. Cross-sectional studies have shown that prevalent meniscal tears are associated with decreased cartilage volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and BMLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Chang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] showed that meniscal tears are longitudinally associated with site specific cartilage loss. Findings in this study are in agreement with the latter study, as we found that meniscal tear increases were associated with medial cartilage loss independent of other knee structural changes. The present study is also the first to show a longitudinal association between increase in meniscal damage and increase in BML size. Menisci aid in load distribution and BMLs have been shown to be a consequence of abnormal loading within the knee joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], which explains the association between the increasing severity of these structural abnormalities. High BMI and osteophytes are possibly the early instigating factors that predict increasing severity of meniscal tears and then change in meniscal tears is associated with other structural changes such as meniscal extrusion, cartilage volume loss and BMLs.</p>
      <p>A strength of our study is that it has the longest follow-up period of any OA cohort using MRI. A limitation of our study is a significant loss to follow up. Loss to follow-up can be a potential source of bias, however re-analysis of the data using inverse probability weighting did not change any of the results, indicating robust results. This cohort also has a wide age range (28–63 years old) as the inclusion criteria did not specify any specific age range. However all the results described in this study were adjusted for age. Another limitation was the absence of radiographs at visit-2 of the study, as we did not anticipate any major changes on radiographs due to young mean-age of the cohort with a low osteoarthritis disease burden and a short follow-up period of 2 years. Furthermore, we did not analyse different types of simple tears (longitudinal, oblique, radial or horizontal) separately due to a low number of individual lesions and hence insufficient power for analysis.</p>

  <body>
    <p>After the publication of this article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], it was discovered that eleven of the trials listed in the original article's Table 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], had been erroneously identified as taking place in the home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These studies actually evaluated physician videoconferencing visits with patients located in clinics. To ensure accuracy, we repeated the literature search in September of 2015, using the same search terms reported in the article and filtered for a publication date prior to July 1, 2014 (the original work was performed in June 2014.) We searched PubMed using the terms ‘telemedicine AND home AND randomized’ (378 results), ‘randomized AND video AND home’ (259 results), ‘videoconferencing AND randomized’ (178 results), and ‘virtual AND visits AND home’ (33 results), and reviewed the 141 studies identified in the review by Dr. Wootton mentioned in the article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Of the 848 search results and 141 studies identified by Dr. Wootton, a total of six randomized controlled trials involving physician video calls directly to a patient in the home were identified (four from the original review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and two additional studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] identified through the new search). The eleven misidentified articles have been removed from the Corrected Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, and included for clarity as Erratum Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The final paper listed in Erratum Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Bishop JE et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], has also been corrected here: our article reported 19 subjects, but the abstract indicates that 17 completed the study. We sincerely apologize for the oversight and any inconvenience these errors might have caused.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Corrected Table 1</label><caption><p>Randomized, controlled trials involving video based virtual house calls from physicians (N = 6)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Study</th><th>Year</th><th>Sample size</th><th>Study population</th><th>Intervention(s)</th><th>Duration</th><th>Primary outcomes</th><th>Results</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">Dorsey ER et al.

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>In animal breeding, genetic variance for complex traits is often estimated using linear mixed models that incorporate information from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers using a realized genomic relationship matrix. In such models, individual genetic markers are weighted equally and genomic variation is treated as a “black box.” This approach is useful for selecting animals with high genetic potential, but it does not generate or utilise knowledge of the biological mechanisms underlying trait variation. Here we propose a linear mixed-model approach that can evaluate the collective effects of sets of SNPs and thereby open the “black box.” The described genomic feature best linear unbiased prediction (GFBLUP) model has two components that are defined by genomic features.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>We analysed data on average daily gain, feed efficiency, and lean meat percentage from 3,085 Duroc boars, along with genotypes from a 60 K SNP chip. In addition information on known quantitative trait loci (QTL) from the animal QTL database was integrated in the GFBLUP as a genomic feature. Our results showed that the most significant QTL categories were indeed biologically meaningful. Additionally, for high heritability traits, prediction accuracy was improved by the incorporation of biological knowledge in prediction models. A simulation study using the real genotypes and simulated phenotypes demonstrated challenges regarding detection of causal variants in low to medium heritability traits.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>The GFBLUP model showed increased predictive ability when enough causal variants were included in the genomic feature to explain over 10 % of the genomic variance, and when dilution by non-causal markers was minimal. In the observed data set, predictive ability was increased by the inclusion of prior QTL information obtained outside the training data set, but only for the trait with highest heritability.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Standard genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) models produce accurate predictions of genetic merit when applied in highly structured populations with many close relationships, as typically found in livestock species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. GBLUP models infer genetic relationships from genetic markers, which are used to construct a realized genomic relationship matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In populations with a high degree of linkage disequilibrium, the determined genomic relationships may provide accurate information about the underlying causal genetic variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The genomic relationship matrix can be constructed in several different ways. Often the individual genetic markers contribute equally to the genomic relationships (perhaps weighted according to minor allele frequencies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As a result, genomic variation is generally treated as a “black box,” ignoring any available information regarding functional features of the genome.</p>
      <p>However, genome-wide association studies suggest that many genetic variants with independent effects are located in the same genes, and that many of these genes are connected via biological pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, extensions of the standard GBLUP modelling approach have been proposed to incorporate available information regarding causal marker distribution along the genome or biological mechanisms underlying trait variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Such approaches may increase prediction accuracy in populations with low levels of genetic relatedness, but not in populations with highly related individuals (e.g. inbred mice stocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). Further studies are required to determine the factors that influence prediction model accuracy in populations with close relationships, such as purebred pig populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Additionally, patterns in GBLUP-derived single-marker statistics (e.g. estimates of single-marker additive genetic effects) can reveal associations between a genomic feature and a complex trait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These associations represent novel insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying a trait, and may be used to develop more accurate genomic feature BLUP (GFBLUP) models.</p>
      <p>We present a GFBLUP modelling approach in the present paper. We investigated whether its use could increase prediction accuracy using real and simulated phenotypes from a purebred Danish Duroc pig population comprising highly related individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The tested GFBLUP model is an extension of the linear mixed model used in standard GBLUP. The novel model includes an additional genetic effect that quantifies the collective action of sets of genetic markers on the trait phenotypes, which can include prior data regarding genomic features, e.g. genomic regions containing previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTL).</p>
      <p>Information on known QTL regions is available in several publicly available databases, such as Animal QTLdb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. QTLs are genomic regions containing one or more putative causal variants, which may be associated with one or more complex traits in different study populations or breeds, potentially varying in effect size. These regions will also span several non-causal variants. Several properties of known QTLs can influence the predictive ability of the GFBLUP modelling approach and the power to detect which marker sets affect a trait. The first potentially influential factor is the proportion of the total genetic variance in a trait that is explained by known QTLs. The second is the number of non-causal variants included in the QTL regions. Third, the model’s power can be impacted by the genetic architecture of QTLs, e.g. whether the causal variants are distributed randomly or clustered along the genome. Furthermore, the model may be affected by population and trait-specific factors, e.g. the total heritability of a trait and the number of observations available for analysis.</p>
      <p>Here we applied our GFBLUP approach to analyse growth rate, feed efficiency, and lean meat percentage in pure-bred Danish Duroc boars (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>) using genomic features defined by the QTL categories listed in the Pig QTLdb database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To attain insight into the biological mechanisms causing trait variation, we identified genomic features that were enriched for associated SNPs. We further investigated the usefulness of this information in a population with highly related individuals by comparing the predictive ability of linear mixed model approaches that either utilised or ignored prior information regarding known QTL regions. Furthermore, we simulated phenotypes based on the observed genotypes of the Danish Duroc population, in order to understand the impact of the above-mentioned five QTL-, population-, or trait-specific factors on the predictive ability of GFBLUP modelling approaches in a population with strong family relationships.</p>
      <p>The aims of this study included evaluating the GFBLUP modelling approach by identifying properties of the previously identified QTL regions that influence prediction accuracy. We also tested the GFBLUP using genomic and phenotypic data from the Danish Duroc population, and to thus provide novel insight into the genetic architecture and biological background of growth phenotypes in pigs. We hypothesized that partitioning genomic variation using GFBLUP would increase predictive ability in a population of highly related individuals, but that this increase would be partly dependent on the power to identify true causal QTLs or significant marker sets.</p>

        <title>The impact of factors—simulated data sets</title>
        <p>The simulated data sets included variations of five factors that potentially affect power, with the aim of detecting marker sets that included causal variants and that affected predictive ability of the GFBLUP model. In all scenarios, the sum of t<sup>2</sup> (the squared value of the single-marker <italic>t</italic>-test statistic) of the markers in the genomic feature performed as well as or better than the other single-marker test statistics (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Therefore, the results presented below are based on this statistic.</p>

          <title>Power to detect marker sets with causal variants</title>
          <p>We investigated the effects of the five different QTL-, population-, or trait-specific factors in terms of the power to detect marker sets including causal variants. In all scenarios, the false positive rate was ≤0.05. Compared to the random causal model, the cluster causal model was more robust to dilution by non-causal SNPs in the marker set (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the absence of dilution, the two types of genetic models did not differ in power. Below, we present the results from the cluster causal model.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Graphs depict the power to detect marker sets that include true causal variants within a simulated phenotype data set with h<sup>2</sup> = 0.2 and comprising 3,000 animals, as a function of dilution through the inclusion of non-causal markers in the genomic feature marker set. Each panel shows the effect of varying the fraction of the genetic variance explained by the causal markers in the genomic feature from 0.1 to 0.5. The left panel shows results from random causal models, while the right panel shows the corresponding results from cluster causal models</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12863_2015_322_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
          <p>In all simulation scenarios, power was decreased by dilution of the effect of causal markers in a marker set by including non-causal markers in the set (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The proportion of the genomic variance explained by the causal variants included in the genomic feature (h<sup>2</sup><sub>f</sub>) greatly impacted the detection power (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and robustness against dilution. At h<sup>2</sup><sub>f</sub> = 0.1, no simulation scenario had an average power of &gt;0.8, and there was almost no power to detect marker sets that included causal variants if N<sub>obs</sub> or h<sup>2</sup> was low, even without dilution. If the causal variant effect was diluted by including non-causal markers in the marker sets, the power was very low in all simulation scenarios (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). At the highest h<sup>2</sup><sub>f</sub>, the impact of dilution was much less severe. This increased robustness towards dilution resulted in power of &gt;70 % in all cluster model scenarios with 3 K observations and a heritability of 0.3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, lower right panel).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Graphs show the power to detect marker sets that include true causal variants within simulated phenotype data with h<sup>2</sup> = 0.2, as a function of dilution through inclusion of non-causal markers in the genomic feature marker set. All panels show the effect of varying sample size from 1,000 to 3,000 animals. The four panels each correspond to a different fraction of the genetic variance being explained by the causal markers in the genomic feature (increasing from 0.1 to 0.5). The causal markers were distributed randomly along the genome</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12863_2015_322_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>The graphs show the power to detect marker sets that include true causal variants within a simulated phenotype data set comprising 3,000 animals, as a function of dilution through inclusion of non-causal markers in the genomic feature marker set.

</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12863_2015_322_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p>
          <p>We found that power was positively correlated with the number of observations (N<sub>obs</sub>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). At h<sup>2</sup><sub>f</sub> = 0.1, the power with a N<sub>obs</sub> of 3 K was 4-fold higher than that at 1 K. This difference in power decreased with increasing h<sup>2</sup><sub>f</sub> . At h<sup>2</sup><sub>f</sub> = 0.5, all scenarios with h<sup>2</sup> = 0.2 detected all sets that included causal variants, provided that there was no dilution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, lower right panel). Increasing the number of observations increased the robustness towards dilution, especially in simulations with high h<sup>2</sup><sub>f</sub>. This increased robustness resulted in shallower slopes of the lines representing 2 K and 3 K observations in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> (lower right panel). Power was also positively correlated with h<sup>2</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, at high h<sup>2</sup><sub>f</sub> and in the absence of dilution, all marker sets including causal variants were detected regardless of overall heritability. In simulations with high h<sup>2</sup><sub>f</sub>, high heritability traits were less affected by dilution than low heritability traits (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, lower half).</p>

          <p>We investigated the effects of dilution and h<sup>2</sup><sub>f</sub> on predictive ability when h<sup>2</sup> was kept constant at 0.20. The design of the validation study was identical to the one used in the real data set. The maximum correlation between the phenotypic observations and the genomic values is the square root of the heritability—in this case h = 0.45. We found a correlation of 0.22 between the observation and the genomic values of the standard GBLUP. The GFBLUP had higher predictive abilities with a correlation of up to 0.30, as long as there was a high proportion of genomic variation caused by the causal markers in the marker set, with few non-causal markers included. Thus, the effects of h<sup>2</sup><sub>f</sub> and dilution on predictive ability were similar to their effects on power (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These findings highlight the importance of maximising the proportion of causal variants in <bold>G</bold><sub>f</sub>. In contrast, predictive ability did not differ between the cluster and random causal variant models (results not shown).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Plot depicting the predictive ability of the simulated phenotype data set with h<sup>2</sup> = 0.2, as a function of dilution through inclusion of non-causal markers in the genomic feature marker set.

          <title>Impact on power to detect marker sets with causal variants</title>
          <p>For traits with medium heritability (h<sup>2</sup> = 0.2), we found power ranging from 0.6 to 1 for the detection of marker sets that included causal variants within a sample size comparable to that of the training data set. The changes in power were related to the proportion of genomic variance explained by the causal marker set, when no non-causal markers were included in <bold>G</bold><sub>f</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Dilution of the causal marker set by addition of non-causal markers (dilution sets) reduced the power. Causal dilution sets could only be detected in scenarios in which all other factors were tuned to maximise power (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Such scenarios were characterized by high proportions of the total genomic variance being explained by the causal variants included in the marker set (C<sub>1</sub>), and large numbers of observations.</p>
          <p>In scenarios where h<sub arrange="stack">f</sub><sup arrange="stack">2</sup> was 0.1, each causal SNP in C<sub>1</sub> explained the same proportion of the genetic variance as the individual SNPs in C<sub>2</sub> (causal SNPs not included in the marker set). In these scenarios, power was very low when C<sub>1</sub> was diluted by non-causal variants included in the marker set, regardless of the number of observations and heritability (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Notably, the simulations included all of the true causal variants in the genotype data set, and we were not relying on LD between markers and true causal genetic variants. Thus, the dilution sets were probably a good representation of the real data set compared to the marker sets that only included true causal variants.</p>
          <p>Scenarios where h<sub arrange="stack">f</sub><sup arrange="stack">2</sup> was &gt;0.1 showed greater power and robustness. This was particularly evident in the cluster causal model where power was over 0.7 for all dilution sets in scenarios with h<sub arrange="stack">f</sub><sup arrange="stack">2</sup> = 0.5 and h<sup>2</sup> = 0.20 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The only parameter for which the estimation deteriorated with increasing h<sup>2</sup><sub>f</sub> was the partitioning of genomic variance between the markers included in the genomic feature and the remaining markers for the dilution sets (estimated <inline-formula id="IEq13"><alternatives><tex-math id="M23">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

At low dilution or low h<sup>2</sup><sub>f</sub>, we achieved unbiased estimates of the proportions of genomic variance that could be attributed to the genomic feature (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). However, at high h<sup>2</sup><sub>f</sub>, the model overestimated the proportion of genomic variance that was attributed to the genomic feature in dilution sets.

          <title>Impact on predictive ability</title>
          <p>In the h<sup>2</sup> = 0.20 simulated data set, the predictive ability of the genome feature model was heavily influenced by dilution and h<sub arrange="stack">f</sub><sup arrange="stack">2</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). When the dilution was minimal, the predictive ability of the GFBLUP model (equation (M<sub>GF</sub>)) was clearly improved compared to that of the standard GBLUP (equation (M<sub>G</sub>)) in most simulation scenarios. This result indicates that being able to separate the true causal variants from the non-causal variants in the GFBLUP would improve predictions, even in populations with relationship structures as tight as in the Danish Duroc breed. If we want to optimize the GFBLUP approach, it is critical to have enough power to correctly detect regions with causal markers in the training population. The use of data available from sources outside of the training data set could increase the ratio of causal variants to non-causal variants among the markers included in the genomic feature.</p>

        <title>Comparing genomic models using real data</title>
        <p>Incorporating information about QTL-based genomic features in the prediction model increased prediction ability for LMP compared with the standard GBLUP model. For the two other traits, predictive ability was not improved by use of any GFBLUP approach. Selecting genomic features based on single markers or genomic blocks that showed significant effects in the training population produced GFBLUP models that explained a lot of the variance found in the training population. For many of the tested models, estimates of genomic heritability exceed the heritability in the data set containing all 34,425 boars (including non-genotyped animals), as well as the genomic heritability estimated using the standard GBLUP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). However, these models did not show greater prediction ability, suggesting data over-fitting. In other words, that some of the significant markers were not actually in linkage disequilibrium, LD, with true causal variants. In contrast, with the QTL set models, genomic heritability estimates were always in the same range as with the standard GBLUP. The main difference between the QTL sets and the two other genomic feature classes (single-marker and block sets) was that the QTL sets included data previously obtained from sources other than the training data, i.e<italic>.</italic> literature results. This additional information may have decreased the risk of including non-causal genomic regions or markers in <bold>G</bold><sub>f</sub>. Additionally, although the QTL set significance was evaluated based on the same training set as the single-marker and block sets, some QTL sets included several marker blocks that were separated on the genome by substantial distance. This could have resulted in less weight being placed on spurious associations in the QTL sets. Results from the simulation study supported the interpretation that QTL set models included less non-causal genomic regions in <bold>G</bold><sub>f</sub> than the other genomic feature classes.

        <p>Our present approach is similar but not identical to the BLUP|GA method used by Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In their study, they improved the accuracy of genomic prediction by weighing each SNP according to how often it has been associated with the investigated trait in the literature.

Like GFBLUP, different Bayesian methods allow differentiation between markers depending on estimates of their genetic variance. However Bayesian lasso does not perform better than standard GBLUP on a subset of the data used in the current study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], in addition Speed and Balding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] found their Adaptive MultiBLUP model to perform as well or better than Bayesian sparse linear mixed models.</p>
        <p>Considering the high relatedness of the animals in our data set, the 5.6 % increase in predictive ability compared to the standard GBLUP for LMP is not negligible. The predictive abilities of our models were lower than the previously reported reliabilities for ADG and FE in the same population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This is because, in contrast to Christensen <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], we left a one-year gap between our training and validation populations. Population structure has two major influences on genomic prediction. First, a normal GBLUP will perform well in populations with strong long-range linkage disequilibrium, although we tried to minimize this issue by leaving one generation between the training and the validation population. This means that the genomic relationship matrix will, at least to some degree, be correlated with any genetic variant that influences the trait that is being predicted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Since the GBLUP model captures a substantial part of the additive genetic variance in highly structured populations, there is less scope for improvement. The second influence of population structure is that high long-range linkage disequilibrium makes it difficult to pinpoint markers that are close to the causal variants. These problems are common to many other genomic feature modelling approaches, including the Adaptive MultiBLUP method proposed by Speed and Balding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. They showed that partitioning markers into classes with distinct effect-size variances increased prediction ability for human diseases, but did not improve prediction of traits within a highly structured inbred mouse population.</p>
        <p>Comparing results from the three traits revealed more significant QTL sets for LMP (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which was also the trait that displayed the highest estimated genomic heritability and predictive ability in all models. Additionally, compared to the two other traits, LMP showed a much lower increase in predictive ability upon inclusion of individuals from 2011 in the validation set (results not shown). There are several possible explanations for the lack of improved predictive ability by QTL set models for ADG and FE. The QTL data may not contain QTL regions that are related to these traits in our populations. However, this is unlikely, since ADG is one of the more intensively studied traits in pigs. A more likely explanation is that the genetic variation in these two traits may have been too low to allow accurate selection of QTL sets with the number of observations in our training population. This interpretation was supported by our re-evaluation of the QTL sets combining the training and validation populations (results not shown). We found that of the five QTL sets that were significant for FE at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), only two were also significant in the new analysis including all individuals. Similarly, for ADG, only one of eight QTL sets was still significant in the new analysis. In contrast, for LMP, of the 11 QTL sets that were significant for LMP (listed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), 7 were significant when all individuals where included in the analysis. A third possibility is that the strong degree of relatedness within the Danish Duroc population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] may have posed problems in terms of partitioning the genomic variance between <bold>G</bold><sub><bold>f</bold></sub> and <bold>G</bold><sub><bold>r</bold></sub>.</p>
        <p>The results from the simulation study show that the main factors determining whether prediction accuracy is increased by GFBLUP, compared to standard GBLUP, is the proportion of genetic variance that can be explained by the markers in <bold>G</bold><sub>f</sub>, and the amount of dilution introduced by adding markers that are not linked to causal variants in <bold>G</bold><sub>f</sub>. These findings suggest that the main explanation for the lack of improvement by the GFBLUP models in prediction ability for ADG and FE is lack of power to distinguish markers linked to causal genetic variation.</p>

          <p>Three QTLs included in <bold>G</bold><sub>f</sub> in the best-performing GFBLUP were tightly associated with immune function: leukocyte quantity, CD4-positive T cell quantity, and blood interleukin-10 amount. Leukocytes (i.e. white blood cells) are immune system cells that increase in quantity as part of the defence against pathogens. Therefore, a high leukocyte quantity is an indicator of infection. CD4-positive T cells are part of the adaptive immune system, and are involved in antibody expression. They also help activate and regulate the other lymphocytes, <italic>e.g.</italic> via production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
          <p>Linkage between LMP and the immune response could occur through several possible mechanisms. Strong activation of the immune system requires energy, and could divert resources that would otherwise be used for growth. High immune system activation can also lead to low protein:lipid ratios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Additionally, the immune system plays an important role in influencing gut microbiota. In mammals, obesity is associated with an abnormal proportion of certain gram-positive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Genes linked to the immune system are notoriously high in genetic variation due to pathogen-driven negative frequency-dependent selection for new alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Thus, these genes could explain a significant proportion of the genetic variation purely by chance. Although the mechanism of involvement remains unclear, immune functions are an interesting avenue for research regarding factors affecting production traits.</p>

        <p>Phenotypes for three traits were available from 34,425 pure-bred Duroc boars that were part of the Danish pig-breeding system. All boar testing was conducted at the national test station Bøgildgaard (Pig Research Centre, Danish Agriculture and Food Council, Denmark). The phenotypic records included average daily gain (ADG; g/day) from 30 kg–100 kg body weight, feed efficiency (FE; feed units/kg gain), and lean meat percentage (LMP). At the end of the test period, all boars were weighed and back-fat was measured by ultrasound and used to predict LMP. The pedigree was traced back to 1984, consisted of 419,961 animals, and included 256 unknown parents (base animals).</p>
        <p>Genotypes were obtained for 3,085 of the phenotyped animals using either Illumina’s Porcine SNP60 BeadChip or Illumina’s 8.5 K GGP-Porcine Low Density Bead SNP chip. Genotypes of animals genotyped with the 8.5 K SNP chip were imputed to the SNP60 chip as described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A total of 33,029 of the 60 K SNPs fulfilled the following editing criteria and were used in our analyses: call rate of SNPs greater than 90 %, minor-allele frequency greater than 0.01, showed Hardy Weinberg expectations (<italic>p</italic>(<italic>χ</italic><sub arrange="stack">1</sub><sup arrange="stack">2</sup>) &gt; 10<sup>− 7</sup>), and allocated a chromosomal position on build Sscrofa10.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

        <p>We performed analyses using two different genomic models: GBLUP and GFBLUP using prior information on genomic features. These models were compared based on their predictive abilities, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genomic effects, and the precision of the estimated genomic parameters. Analyses utilized both observed and simulated phenotypic data.</p>
        <p>The GFBLUP model was based on a linear mixed model including two random genomic effects:<disp-formula id="Equb"><alternatives><tex-math id="M33">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

However, no matter how the threshold is selected for determining “significant associations,” it is somewhat arbitrary, and genetic markers with slightly differing test statistics may be treated completely differently. By design, this test has high power to detect association if the genomic feature harbours genetic markers with large effects, but it will not detect a genomic feature with many genetic markers having small to moderate effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In such a case, it would be more powerful to use a summary statistic, such as the mean or sum of the test statistic for all genetic markers belonging to the same genomic feature.

          <title>Testing for association between a genomic feature and a phenotype</title>
          <p>A genomic feature was considered significant if the associated summary statistics were more extreme than the cut-off set based on an empirical distribution of random marker sets of same size as the genomic feature. This was tested using a competitive null hypothesis, i.e<italic>.</italic> that the degree of association of the feature set was the same as that of a random marker set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To this end, we obtained an empirical distribution of the test statistic by sampling random marker sets. A null hypothesis is only competitive if the parameters influencing the summary statistic are identical to the alternative hypothesis. Thus, there must be an equal number of markers for the random set and the true set, and the correlation structure among markers (due to linkage disequilibrium) should be retained. The empirical distribution of the summary statistics was obtained using the following permutation procedure. First, the observed test statistic was ordered accordingly to the physical position of the SNPs, and an element (i.e<italic>.</italic> one test statistic) was randomly selected from this vector. All elements were then shifted to new positions—such that the selected one became the first element, with the remaining SNPs shifted to new positions, but maintaining the original order. A new summary statistic was then computed based on the original position of the genomic features. This uncouples any associations between SNPs and the genomic feature, while retaining the correlation structure among test statistics. The permutation was repeated 1,000 times for each set in the feature class, and empirical <italic>p</italic> values were obtained through one-tailed tests of the proportion of randomly sampled summary statistics larger than that observed.</p>

        <sec id="Sec32">
          <title>Genomic feature classes</title>
          <p>Several strategies were used to define genetic marker sets that formed different classes of genomic features used in GBLUP and GFBLUP model analyses.</p>
          <p>First, genomic features were derived from single-marker association test statistics (single-marker sets). A standard <italic>t</italic>-test was used to assess the single-marker statistical significance of the regression effect for individual SNPs. When an SNP was determined to be significantly associated with the genomic value based on a pre-specified significance cut-off level, the corresponding genome regions were then considered to define a “genomic feature.” These steps were repeated with decreasing significance cut-offs, thereby increasing the genomic region of the feature (SNP set).</p>
          <p>Second, including or excluding SNPs from a genomic feature based on single-marker association tests can result in over-fitting of the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. To ameliorate this risk, we created block sets of 50 markers that were physical adjacent on the genome, and we tested the associations of these marker sets with the trait using the above-described summary statistics. The significance of the association between the marker sets and the trait was determined using a pre-defined set of cut-off levels. Marker sets with <italic>p</italic> values below the cut-off were included in the genomic feature set.</p>
          <p>Third, to assess the benefit of including prior data in GFBLUP models, we derived genomic features from the summary statistics of a group of genetic markers defined by a previously identified QTL region (a QTL set). The QTLs recorded in the Pig QTL database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] are organized based on trait ontology, and we used the 167 traits listed in the Vertebrate Trait Ontology column. A trait can have multiple associated QTLs originating from several sources. We utilized the QTLs comprising the QTL set for the selected trait. The markers of our data set were grouped according to the genomic locations of QTL sets for the 167 trait categories downloaded from the database. The genomic region spanned by each individual QTL was standardized to 250 kb on each side of the QTL midpoint. Only QTL sets spanning &gt;2 SNPs were used in the analysis. A marker set containing the SNPs that was not included in any of the QTL sets and a set containing all markers was added to this genomic feature class, resulting in a total of 169 tested marker sets. The number of SNPs in each QTL set is shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>.</p>

        <title>Simulated data</title>
        <p>We also established a series of simulation studies to investigate factors influencing the power to detect genomic features affecting the trait phenotype, estimation of genomic parameters, and prediction ability of the two tested linear mixed models. We used the method described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] pp. 98. The genetic values and residuals were simulated in R using the function mvrnorm from the library MASS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The factors varied in the simulations included genomic heritability (<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup>), proportion of genomic variance explained by causal SNPs in the genomic feature (<italic>h</italic><sub arrange="stack"><italic>f</italic></sub><sup arrange="stack">2</sup>), proportion of non-causal SNPs in the genetic marker set defined by the genomic feature (<italic>dilution</italic>), genome distribution of causal SNPs (<italic>causal model</italic>) (i.e<italic>.</italic> how the causal SNPs were physically distributed on the genome: random or clustered), and the number of phenotypic observations available for analysis (N<sub>obs</sub>).</p>
        <sec id="Sec34">
          <title>Genotypes</title>
          <p>The simulations were based on the real genotype data set including 3,085 individuals and 33,029 SNPs. In all scenarios, the number of causal SNPs was equal to 1,000. Causal sets were divided into two subsets. The first subset <italic>C</italic><sub>1</sub> included 100 SNPs and was used as the causal SNP set in the genomic feature that explains 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, or 50 % of the genomic variance. The second subset <italic>C</italic><sub>2</sub> included 900 SNPs and explained the remaining genomic variance. To mimic relevant genetic scenarios, the genome distribution of the causal SNPs in the genomic feature was simulated using two different causal models: a <italic>random</italic> and a <italic>cluster</italic> model. The cluster model illustrated causal SNPs among connected genes in QTL regions. On the other hand, the random model provides an example of a trait with causal variants distributed in genes, which are linked to many different processes such that the pattern seems <italic>random</italic>. For the clustered causal model, the 100 causal SNPs in <italic>C</italic><sub>1</sub> were chosen from 20 randomly selected genomic regions spanning 50 SNPs each, and the remaining 900 SNPs in <italic>C</italic><sub>2</sub> were randomly selected from the complete SNP set. For the random causal model, the SNPs in <italic>C</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>2</sub> were randomly selected from the complete SNP set. To investigate the effects of non-causal SNPs within the causal sets, we added an increasing number of non-causal SNPs (100, 200, …, 1,900, 2,000), to the causal sets, in a process referred to as <italic>dilution</italic>. To determine the false-positive rate, 50 marker sets (referred to as a non-causal SNP set) of varying sizes (100, 500, 1,000, and 5,000) were sampled among the non-causal SNPs.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
<bold>] are organized based on trait ontology, and we used the 167 traits listed in the Vertebrate Trait Ontology column.</bold> A marker set containing the SNPs that was not included in any of the QTL sets and a set containing all markers was added to this genomic feature class, resulting in a total of 169 tested marker sets. The number of SNPs associated with each of the 169 QTL sets is shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> (XLSX 48 kb)</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>One of the main phenomena occurring in cellular membranes during virus infection is a change in membrane permeability. It has been observed that numerous viral proteins can oligomerize and form structures known as viroporins that alter the permeability of membranes. Previous findings have identified such proteins in cells infected with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a member of the same family that Dengue virus (DENV) belongs to (<italic>Flaviviridae</italic>). In the present work, we investigated whether the small hydrophobic DENV protein NS2B serves a viroporin function.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>We cloned the DENV NS2B sequence and expressed it in a bacterial expression system. Subsequently, we evaluated the effect of DENV NS2B on membranes when NS2B was overexpressed, measured bacterial growth restriction, and evaluated changes of permeability to hygromycin. The NS2B protein was purified by affinity chromatography, and crosslinking assays were performed to determine the presence of oligomers. Hemolysis assays and transmission electron microscopy were performed to identify structures involved in permeability changes.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>The DENV-2 NS2B protein showed similitude with the JEV viroporin. The DENV-2 NS2B protein possessed the ability to change the membrane permeability in bacteria, to restrict bacterial cell growth, and to enable membrane permeability to hygromycin B. The NS2B protein formed trimers that could participate in cell lysis and generate organized structures on eukaryotes membranes.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Our data suggest that the DENV-2 NS2B viral protein is capable of oligomerizing and organizing to form pore-like structures in different lipid environments, thereby modifying the permeability of cell membranes.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Dengue viruses (DENVs) are enveloped (+) sense RNA viruses belonging to the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. The DENV replication cycle initiates following receptor binding to the host cell membrane, which is followed by internalization via endocytosis and subsequent release into the cytoplasm. The genome is then translated into a large polyprotein, which is proteolytically processed to yield 3 structural proteins (envelope, membrane precursor, and capsid) and 7 non-structural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>Cells infected with DENV undergo a series of detrimental functional and structural changes, such as cell rounding, shrinkage, and dislodgment from the growth surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, the membranes of DENV-infected cells are compromised during viral RNA replication, assembly, and egress, which induce remodeling and redistribution of distinct cell membrane structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] including the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These phenomena result in dramatic cytopathic effects that compromise the viability of infected cells.</p>
      <p>Results from several studies have shown that in addition to cytopathic effects, another common feature of infected cells is the modification of host cell membrane permeability resulting from the incorporation of viral proteins into the infected cell membrane. This group of viral proteins is collectively referred to as viroporins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], which are small hydrophobic viral proteins that oligomerize in the membranes of different intracellular compartments and cause cell permeabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>All viroporins share structural motifs, such as hydrophobic domains that form an amphipathic α-helix, and a cluster of basic residues, which can interact with negatively charged lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Viroporins may alter membrane permeability to facilitate different replication steps, such as viral entry and egress. While these molecules may be nonessential for viral genome replication, evidence suggests that they are required for the production of infective particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] In addition, viroporins influence several cellular functions, including vesicular trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], membrane remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], ion homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], apoptosis induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and activation of inflammatory mechanisms that may participate in pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>Viroporins have been identified in several RNA viruses including <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family members such as hepatitis C and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Results from a study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] showed that small hydrophobic nonstructural JEV proteins can influence membrane permeability. In that study, the JEV protein NS2B was found to have membrane-destabilizing activity (MDA) in all assays evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, DENV also expresses the NS2B protein, and the NS2B proteins of JEV and DENV show conserved structural and functional characteristics. These characteristics include the hydrophilic segment, which is required for the cofactor activity of viral protease NS3, and the 3 hydrophobic regions that are thought to be responsible for membrane association and to generate the MDA. In addition, we previously demonstrated that NS2B is localized in cellular membranes (particularly in lipid rafts) due to the hydrophobic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Data from a subsequent study suggested that the NS2B protein contains alpha-helical transmembrane domains that direct folds within micelles, indicating the ability of this protein to associate with membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These lines of evidences suggest the possibility that NS2B of DENV may exert a function that is analogous to NS2B of JEV.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we observed by in silico analysis that the NS2B has a highly hydrophobic profile, similar to that previously reported for the JEV NS2B protein. Furthermore, comparative analysis between the DENV and JEV NS2B sequences revealed striking similarities. We also observed that the overexpression of recombinant NS2B in bacteria affected bacteria cell growth and enhanced bacterial membrane permeability to hygromycin B (HygB). In addition, crosslinking tests showed the ability to form oligomers; when recombinant NS2B was incubated with erythrocyte membrane systems, it produced organized structures within the membranes, which promoted the destabilization of the erythrocyte membrane and cell lysis. Therefore, this study represents the first investigation into the potential role of NS2B in causing changes in membrane permeability during DENV infection.</p>

        <title><italic>In silico</italic> analysis of the DENV NS2B protein identified similarity with the JEV NS2B protein</title>
        <p>Results from a previous study demonstrated that the NS2B protein from JEV could modify membrane permeability in different systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. <italic>In-silico</italic> analysis showed a 32 % identity between the sequences of the JEV and DENV NS2B proteins. In addition, this analysis identified some amino acids within the transmembrane regions that were identical or showed strong similarity, suggesting that they maintained the biochemical proprieties (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the membrane-altering property of both viral NS2B proteins may be conserved. Thus, we generated hydropathy plots for the NS2B proteins using the Kyte–Doolittle method. This analysis revealed 3 clear hydrophobic domains located in the amino terminal and carboxy terminus of NS2B, which may reflect the transmembrane regions present in this protein. The topology of DENV NS2B is similar to that described for JEV NS2B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], for which 3 transmembrane regions were observed in the same positions along the amino acid sequence. In addition, aromatic and basic residues were identified in both sequences, which is an important characteristic of viral proteins with MDA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). A topological representation of the NS2B protein was generated using the Socs MEMSAT program. The orientation of the 3 transmembrane regions was determined, showing that the amino and carboxyl-terminal domains were oriented towards the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>); these findings corroborate a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>

        <title>Bacterial expression and purification of the DENV NS2B protein</title>
        <p>To obtain sufficient recombinant DENV NS2B protein for analyzing its membrane-altering activity, we cloned and expressed the NS2B protein with an N-terminus V5 epitope and a 6× His tag to facilitate its purification (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). This construct was used to transform <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 Star cells. A clone harboring the NS2B expression vector was grown in culture and induced with IPTG 3, 6, and 9 h post-transformation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Thus, we decided to overexpress the NS2B protein. This protein was expressed in inclusion bodies, similarly to other viral proteins with viroporin activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A 17-kDa band was observed by western blotting at 3, 6, and 9 h post-transformation, which was identified as the tagged NS2B protein using an anti-V5 antibody (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). In addition, we purified the NS2B protein using 2 strategies. The first strategy involved the induction of NS2B expression after 9 h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, lane 1), which was partially purified by eluting a band of the appropriate mass (17 kDa) from a Coomassie Blue-stained gel (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, Lanes 2 and 3). NS2B was further purified with nickel resin via the N-terminal 6× His tag on the recombinant NS2B protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). Several 1 mL-aliquots were eluted from the nickel resin, and Coomassie Blue staining revealed only the presence of the 17-kDa a band in the last fraction recovered.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Expression and purification of NS2B protein from bacteria. <bold>a</bold>.

        <p>To demonstrate that the NS2B protein was associated with bacterial membranes, additional experiments were performed. We isolated membranes and then extracted the membrane proteins using TDPC detergent to study proteins contained in membrane fractions from inclusion bodies. The transformed bacteria were grown as described previously.</p>
        <p>Next, a western blot was performed using an anti-V5 antibody to detect the NS2B protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Subsequently, the membrane was washed, stripped and assessed by re-probed with mouse polyclonal anti-OMPF and anti-OMPC proteins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b and c</xref>). We found 2 bands with the predicted molecular weights of 37 kDa and 40 kDa for the porins described above respectively. This result confirmed that the NS2B protein is found in the membrane fractions with OMPC and OMPF.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Association of the NS2B protein with bacterial membranes. <bold>a</bold> Western blot analysis of NS2B protein expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> using an anti-V5 antibody.

        <title>Changes in bacterial membrane permeability following expression of the NS2B protein</title>
        <p><italic>In silico</italic> analysis suggested that the DENV NS2B protein is homologous to the JEV NS2B protein and possesses the same MDA. If the NS2B protein causes membrane destabilization, a widely known assay could be used to confirm this possibility. <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells, which express lysozyme, were transformed with a plasmid encoding NS2B. Disruptions in the inner bacterial membrane cause the release of the bacteriophage T7 lysozyme, which in turn promotes cell lysis that can be quantified by measuring the optical density of bacterial cultures. BL21(DE3) growth was not affected following transformation with the NS2B vector, in the presence or absence of IPTG (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Bacterial growth was also unaffected in BL1(DE3)pLysS cultures transformed with the NS2B expression vector, or transformed with the parental vector pProEX in the absence of IPTG (NS2B expression not induced), when compared to negative control bacteria expressing the soluble polypyrimidine-tract-binding (PTB) protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). However, when NS2B expression was induced, bacterial growth was markedly inhibited compared to the PTB and pProEX controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). We also investigated whether NS2B expression altered the permeability of bacterial membranes, allowing entry of the translation inhibitor HygB. Thus, bacterial cultures were metabolically labeled with [S<sup>35</sup>]-methionine after the addition of HygB, under NS2B-inducing conditions. We observed that protein synthesis was completely inhibited in a time-dependent manner, indicating that the bacterial membranes became permeable to HygB following NS2B induction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). However, no effect was observed with bacteria expressing an unrelated protein (PTB) in the absence or presence of HygB (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the NS2B protein associates with membranes, destabilizes their architecture, and allows the entrance of HygB.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>NS2B protein expression arrests <italic>E. coli</italic> growth and affects the permeability of bacterial membranes. <bold>a</bold> Grow courve of <italic>E.coli</italic> BL21 DE3 transformed with pProEX/NS2B (toxicity control).

        <title>NS2B forms homo-oligomers involved in lytic effects</title>
        <p>A conserved characteristic of viroporins is the presence of hydrophobic domains that interact with lipid membranes. Another property shared by viroporins is their ability to oligomerize once inserted into cell membranes. Previous reports demonstrated that several viroporins could oligomerize in the presence of glutaraldehyde [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To determine whether NS2B acts as a viroporin, we evaluated its ability to form homo-oligomers in vitro by chemical cross-linking. After the NS2B protein was incubated with increasing glutaraldehyde concentrations, western blots revealed the presence of 2 or 3 bands (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>, lanes 1–3), which migrated at the expected position of monomers (17 kDa), dimers (34 kDa), and trimers (51 kDa). We hypothesized that upon membrane association of the NS2B protein, it oligomerizes to form structures similar to channel or pores that facilitate changes in membrane permeability. For this the hemolytic activity of NS2B was assayed in human erythrocytes, which are an efficient model for studying protein-membrane interactions, as well as changes in membrane permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] Erythrocytes were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with various concentrations of NS2B or the negative-control PTB protein, and hemolysis levels were measured in supernatants following centrifugation. The NS2B protein showed hemolytic activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Approximately 20 % of the erythrocytes were lysed when exposed to 100 μg of purified NS2B protein, while at lower quantities, the lytic activity was reduced. In contrast, hemolysis did not occur following incubation with the same concentrations of the control protein. These results suggested that the NS2B protein associated with erythrocyte membranes to form structured oligomers and caused cell lysis in a concentration-dependent manner.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Analysis of NS2B protein to perform oligomerization. <bold>a</bold> The NS2B protein was incubated with different glutaraldehyde concentrations. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and protein expression was analyzed by western blotting.

        <title>Confirmation of an organized NS2B protein structure on eukaryotic membranes</title>
        <p>The above results showed that NS2B formed at least trimeric structures that induced hemolytic activity. Base on this finding, we analyzed the presence of the NS2B protein in erythrocyte ghost membranes by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This analysis revealed the presence of ring-shaped structures, the number of which was dependent on the NS2B concentration used (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Ring-shaped structures were not identified in erythrocytes ghosts maintained in PBS or in the presence of albumin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). Analysis of these structures showed circular ring structures were also commonly associated with the membranes. These structures were similar to those observed with other viral proteins with viroporin activity. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Rings with sizes between 30 and 40 nm in diameter were most frequently found, although larger structures were detected using a higher NS2B quantity (100 μg), as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>. The number of ring-shaped structures per square micron increased according the amount of NS2B used (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). Finally, it was confirmed that the increase in the number of ring-shaped structures at the higher NS2B quantity correlated with increased lytic activity observed in the hemolysis assays (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). Our results provide the first direct evidence that the NS2B protein can oligomerize in mammalian membranes and that it possesses pore-forming activity that modifies membrane permeability with lytic effects on the target membrane, as reported for other viroporins.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Characterization of the oligomeric structure of the NS2B protein by TEM. <bold>a</bold> TEM of the NS2B protein in erythrocyte ghosts.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Numerous studies using different positive-strand RNA viruses have demonstrated that reorganization of the intracellular membrane can create a scaffold for the replication machinery of different viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. During the <italic>dengue</italic> viral cycle, cell membranes are critical elements for the entrance, translation, replication, and assembly of viruses. As infection progresses, several viral proteins can disturb cell membrane structures. According to previous reports, DENV proteins promote cellular membranes reorganization, although the functions of their small hydrophobic proteins have not been studied enough in this regard. Different reports have identified a potential role that these proteins may exert on several membrane systems, such as identifying membranotropic regions, or its association with artificial membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, it has not been determined if any of these proteins can promote changes in membrane permeability. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine if the hydrophobic NS2B protein possesses viroporin activity, considering that this protein was expressed in membranes. We and others previously showed that this protein is present in cell membranes, particularly lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A bioinformatics study performed with the NS2B sequence revealed a high degree of homology with a previously reported viroporin for a member of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Previous in vitro results using microsomal membranes also showed that the cleavage products NS2B and NS3 (Pro) were membrane-associated. Furthermore, this membrane requirement was due to the presence of hydrophobic regions predicted in NS2B and found in lipid rafts in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
      <p>One of more distinctive characteristics of viroporins is their ability of induce changes in membrane permeability. In this study, we provide the first evidence that pore-forming activity occurs when the NS2B protein is expressed in a bacterial system, as widely shown with other viral proteins with viroporin activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In prokaryotic systems such as <italic>E. coli</italic>, the NS2B protein was effective in inducing sensitivity to HygB under the conditions used. In addition, changes in permeability to HygB and alterations of bacterial growth may exert a direct effect on the incorporation of NS2B within bacterial membranes, leading to lost membrane integrity. This data are consistent with those obtained with viroporin NS2B of JEV, suggesting that the activity could be conserved.</p>
      <p>Another important feature of viroporins is that they can oligomerize; therefore, great efforts have been taken to understand the architecture of these proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis of the NS2B sequence showed the presence of 3 transmembrane regions, which may be important for membrane insertion or oligomerization. Chemical cross-linking experiments performed with glutaraldehyde revealed that NS2B could oligomerize into trimeric species under reducing conditions; however, in the absence of glutaraldehyde, dimers were also observed. The above data strongly suggest that the intermolecular associations observed do not depend on disulfide bridges. Instead, NS2B dimer and trimer formation may depend upon and hydrophobic interactions, as observed with other viroporins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. NS2B oligomers may organize into pore structures in cell membranes, which would account for the membrane permeability alterations observed. Various systems have been employed to study these phenomena, such as dye-loaded liposomes, Xenopus oocytes, and unilamellar membranes. We employed 2 strategies to characterize these structures. In hemolysis assays, we showed that the NS2B protein in contact with human erythrocytes modified the membrane permeability, promoting the release of hemoglobin. To further address this issue, we performed TEM studies to determine whether the NS2B protein integrates into biological membranes and forms pores in the target membrane (erythrocyte ghosts). Electron micrographs showed a distribution of ring-shaped structures of variable sizes that were similar those observed for other viroporins. These ring-shaped structures increased in a dose-dependent manner with the quantity of NS2B protein added. In addition, they were absent in membrane controls maintained in PBS or in presence of albumin. These data strongly suggest that NS2B directly contacts and modifies the membrane structure.</p>
      <p>This work provides the first direct evidence that the NS2B protein is capable of oligomerizing, producing pore-like structures in different environments, and modifying the permeability of the membrane. Future studies are necessary to assess whether the effect of the protein NS2B in these model membranes occur in the context of infection with DENV. However, it is important to mention that the protein NS2B, similar to other small hydrophobic viral proteins, is actively transported to vesicles where replication complexes are formed. The presence of pores in these vesicles has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] to facilitate the process of viral-genome packing. The origin of these pores is unknown, although it is likely that NS2B could participate in these processes.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>This study demonstrated the ability of the NS2B protein to function as a viroporin. Our results showed that the NS2B protein can alter the permeability of different models of membranes and that organized structures were observed in ghost erythrocyte membranes. These results suggested that NS2B potentially has MDA, a function that could be critical for steps during the DENV replication cycle.</p>

Briefly, total RNA was extracted from DENV-2-infected C6/36 cells using the Trizol reagent (Gibco, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The NS2B sequence from DENV-2 (New Guinea) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR, using the primer pair: 5′-ctaggatccatgagctggccacta-3′ (forward) and 5′-ccggaattctcaccgttgtttcttcac-3′ (reverse). The PCR product was ligated into the pET151/D-TOPO cloning vector in frame with cDNA encoding a V5 epitope and a 6× His tag (V5H6NS2B). Finally, the plasmid from the resultant colonies was purified the next day using an EndoFree Plasmid Purification Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA).

The bacterial lysates were then sonicated, centrifuged, and resuspended in 50 mM Tris and 10 mM EDTA. These steps were performed to pellet the inclusion bodies containing the NS2B protein, which were then analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining and western blotting with a monoclonal antibody against the V5 epitope (Invitrogen). The V5H6NS2B protein was purified by 2 methods. First, inclusion bodies were resolved by electrophoresis on a 17 % SDS-PAGE gel, and the V5H6NS2B protein was eluted from an excised gel piece in 1 % PBS overnight at 4 °C. The V5H6NS2B protein was further purified using the ProBond Purification System (Invitrogen). Briefly, nickel-coupled resin was resuspended in native-binding buffer (250 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 8.0, 2.5 M NaCl) and the V5H6NS2B protein was allowed to bind the resin overnight at 4 °C.

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa and malnutrition constitute the main obstacles for successful treatment of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). The aim of this study was to assess the effect of consuming daily 100 g RUTF (ready-to-use therapeutic food) as supplement, on body composition, anemia and zinc status of hospitalized PLWH in Senegal.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>A Controlled clinical trial was conducted in 65 PLWH randomly allocated to receive either standard hospital diet alone (Control group: <italic>n</italic> = 33), or the standard diet supplemented with 100 g RUTF/day (RUTF group: <italic>n</italic> = 32). Supplementation was continued at home during 9 weeks. Individual dietary intakes were measured and compared to the Recommended Dietary Allowances. Body composition was determined using Bio-Impedance Analysis. Hemoglobin was measured by HemoCue and plasma zinc (PZ) concentration by atomic absorption spectrometry. PZ was adjusted to infection (CRP and α1-AGP). All measures were conducted on admission, discharge and after 9 weeks home-based follow up.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>34 and 24 % of the patients in RUTF and Control groups were suffering from severe malnutrition (BMI &lt; 16 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), respectively. In both groups, more than 90 % were anemic and zinc deficiency affected over 50 % of the patients. Food consumed by the Control group represented 75, 14 and 55 % of their daily recommended intake (DRI) of energy, iron and zinc, respectively. When 100 g of RUTF was consumed with the standard diet, the DRI of energy and zinc were 100 % covered (2147 kcal, 10.4 mg, respectively), but not iron (2.9 mg). After 9 weeks of supplementation, body weight, and fat-free mass increased significantly by +11 % (<italic>p = 0.033</italic>), and +11.8 % (<italic>p = 0.033</italic>) in the RUTF group, but not in the Control group, while percentage body fat was comparable between groups (<italic>p = 0.888</italic>). In the RUTF group, fat free mass gain is higher in the patients on ART (+11.7 %, <italic>n</italic> = 14; <italic>p = 0.0001)</italic> than in those without ART (+6.2 %, <italic>n</italic> = 6; <italic>p = 0.032</italic>). Anemia decreased significantly with the supplementation, but zinc status, measured using plasma zinc concentration, remained unchanged.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Improving PLWH’ diet with 100 g RUTF for a long period has a positive impact on muscle mass and anemia but not on the zinc status of the patients.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Malnutrition is one of the major complications among PLWH (people living with HIV/AIDS) infection and a significant factor in advancing the disease. Wasting syndrome, closely associated with mortality and morbidity, is defined as a weight loss of at least 10 % in the presence of diarrhea or chronic weakness and documented fever for at least 30 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. HIV-associated wasting was recognized as a negative prognostic indicator and as reported by Tabi &amp; Vogel in Ghana, more patients with HIV/AIDS die because of their poor nutritional status rather than the disease itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, malnourished PLWH have a higher risk of death and suboptimal response to treatment especially when antiretroviral therapy (ART) is initiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Indeed, studies of body composition have demonstrated that during the wasting syndrome, depleted level of body cell mass, which contains the metabolically active tissue rather than weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], have been associated with increased risk of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Wasting in most cases results from a combination of factors, including drug use, medications, concurrent diseases, and HIV itself. However, reduced energy intake is suggested as the primary determinant of HIV-related wasting syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, there has been considerable interest in the measurement of body composition in patients with HIV/AIDS infection. Such measurements can be useful in conjunction with well-maintained weight records to characterize an individual’s response to various medical or nutritional interventions. Many approaches have been used to reverse weight loss in HIV-infected people, including appetite stimulants, anabolic agents, cytokine inhibitors and hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In resource-limited settings where malnutrition is the second complication of HIV infection, nutritional intervention programs should be a priority for the successful care of PLWH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In Senegal, we have demonstrated that daily supplementation with 43 g RUTF, a ready to use peanut-based therapeutic food, when mixed with millet porridge provided an additional energy intake of 245 kcal/d, and had a positive impact on body composition, particularly by increasing fat free mass and active cell mass among adults HIV-outpatient with chronic malnutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Ndekha et al. in Malawi showed a significant improvement on body mass index (BMI) and fat free mass in adult PLWH supplemented with 245 g RUTF/d providing 1362 kcal, 35.5 g protein, 78 μg of selenium, and 8 mg of zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Recently, in South Africa, Evans et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] in a randomized study showed a positive effect of supplementation with a high-protein high-energy meal (100 g equivalent to 388 kcal/d). Others authors have found similar results on body composition using different supplements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In most of these studies, no significant difference was reported on CD4, viral load and quality life. However, the most important observation was that none of these diets did not provide enough zinc to cover the normal zinc requirement of the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], although data from the literature showed that zinc deficiency remains a major problem in PLWH. During HIV infection, zinc deficiency is associated with loss of appetite, disease progression and increased morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Mocchegiani et al. showed that supplementation with zinc at doses approximately 3 times the RDA significantly increased weight, plasma zinc concentration, CD4 count and reduced the incidence of opportunistic infections in PLWH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that at least 1 RDA of zinc should be daily provided to PLWH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In Senegal, the supplementation of PLWH with 43 g RUTF/d covered 86 % of the daily recommended intake of zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is likely that the dose provided daily in this previous study was inadequate (&lt;1 RDA) to cover the zinc requirement of the patients. It is also possible that a low efficiency of zinc absorption from the supplement had occurred due to the presence of phytates in the RUTF and the millet porridge. Millet and RUTF contain a noticeable amount of phytates, and it is now well known that zinc bioavailability is affected by the amounts of phytates consumed with the meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In view of these above considerations, we decided to increase the daily consumption of RUTF (100 g /d) in order to meet at least one RDA of zinc requirement while maintaining the additional amount of energy consumed as recommended by WHO for PLWH. We also replaced the millet porridge with rice porridge that contains less <italic>myo</italic>-inositol phosphate. Hence, the present study was designed to measure the effect of 100 g/d RUTF consumed with rice porridge on body composition, anemia and zinc status of hospitalized PLWH in Senegal over a 3 month period. We hypothesized that such supplement would significantly improve the nutritional status of PLWH.</p>

        <title>Study setting and subjects</title>
        <p>The study was conducted from October 2011 to Jun 2012 at the Service des maladies infectieuses (SMI), located in the Centre Hospitalier National Universitaire de Fann (CHNU), Dakar, Senegal (West Africa). Upon admission and clinical examination, the eligibility of the patients enrolled in the study was established as follows: HIV/AIDS men and women at any WHO stages of the disease, under antiretroviral (ART) treatment or not, without psychiatric illness, not diabetic, without long term physical disability, and inability to eat. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Ministry of Health of Senegal and registered with the National Institutes of Health as a clinical trial number NCT02433743. Prior to participation, the patients were informed about the study objectives and procedures, and their written consent was obtained.</p>

      <sec id="Sec4">
        <title>Study design</title>
        <p>The study was designed as a randomized, controlled trial with one treatment group and a Control group. Eligible sixty-five (65) HIV- infected adults hospitalized in the SMI were randomly allocated to receive either standard hospital diet (Control group: <italic>n</italic> = 33), or standard hospital diet supplemented with RUTF (RUTF group: <italic>n</italic> = 32). Sample-size calculations was based on the expected difference of 2.3 ± 2.1 kg in change in fat free mass between group from baseline to 9 week, with a 90 % power and 5 % significance level. The enrollment of the patients was carried out by the clinician. The randomization and assignment to group was performed by the senior researcher using a computer-generated random number list (EPI INFO 6.0; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta).</p>

      <sec id="Sec5">
        <title>Diet and nutritional supplement</title>
        <p>During hospitalization, the Control group received a standard hospital diet that consisted of three local meals/d (breakfast, lunch and dinner). The meals were provided either by the hospital or by the patient’s relatives. The RUTF group received daily, in addition to the standard hospital diet, 200 g of supplement (100 g RUTF mixed with 100 g of rice porridge). The rice porridge (9.1 g rice flour per 100 ml water) was prepared extemporaneously, mixed with the RUTF, and served immediately. RUTF is composed of peanut butter and skimmed milk powder fortified with a vitamin-mineral complex commercialized by Nutriset. Our laboratory tested RUTF for the first time during the rehabilitation of children suffering from severe and acute malnutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. All meals were served at 7:00 AM, 1:00 PM and 6:00 PM. The supplement was served twice (2 × 100 g) daily: at 11:00 AM and 5:00 PM. In addition, all the patients (Control and RUTF) received a vegetable-based soup from the micro-garden of the hospital at 12:00 AM.</p>
        <p>The nutrient composition of the supplement and percentage coverage of nutrient requirements relative to RDA are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. At discharge, each patient of the RUTF group received 100 g/d RUTF during 9 weeks for home-based supplement preparation. Both groups received dietary counseling to improve their diet at home. Clinical follow-up was performed in both RUTF and Control groups over a 3 months period (during hospitalization, and 9 weeks after).

        <title>Dietary assessment</title>
        <p>Dietary intakes were measured during 7 consecutive days in 10 randomly selected subjects from each group during the hospitalization period. Individual ration of each meal served by the hospital or provided by the relatives was weighed with a food scale (i-Balance 2600 Myweigh, Scale Company, Phoenix, USA). At the end of the meal, the remains (R) were weighed. Thus, the difference between the amount served and the remaining amount was used to calculate the exact amount of food consumed by the patient. Nutrient intakes were calculated using the African food composition tables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and Nutrisurvey/ENA software, and were compared to RDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>

The accuracy of the instrument was tested before the measurements by using a 422Ω standard resistor purchased with the analyzer. The resistance and reactance values of measurements are given to the nearest 0.1 Ω from a digital display. Total body water (TBW) was predicted from the equation developed by Diouf et al. in HIV-infected people in Senegal: TBW (kg) = 0.3756(height<sup>2</sup>/R<sub>1000</sub>) + 0.1717(weight) – 0.5756 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

        <title>Blood sampling and analysis</title>
        <p>Blood sampling was performed in the morning between 8:00–10:00 AM on admission, at discharge and after 9 week home follow-up. All blood collection and processing procedures were conformed to the recommendations of the International Zinc Nutrition Collaborative Group: IZiNCG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Blood was collected into trace element–free polyethylene zinc-free tubes containing lithium heparin anticoagulant, and centrifuged shortly after. The time of the sample collection and of the most recent food intake were noted and used to adjust for this interval in the data analysis. The reason for this statistical adjustment for the time interval between the last meal and the blood collection was to minimize the variability due to known meal-related effects on plasma zinc concentrations. Hemoglobin concentration was measured by using a HemoCue photometer (HemoCue Hb 201+; HemoCue AB, Angelholm, Sweden). Immunocytometry (Becton Dickinson FACS count Immunocytometry systems, California) determined the CD4 cell count in total blood using FACS count kits reagent (Becton Dickinson, BD Bioscience). Blood samples were centrifuged at 3200 rpm (EBA 20 centrifuge model 2002; Andreas Hettich GmbH &amp; Co KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) during 12 min and plasma samples were collected in trace element-free cryovials and stored at−80 °C in the laboratory until assays. All the analysis was performed in the Laboratory of Nutrition, University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar. Plasma zinc (PZ) concentrations were measured in duplicate by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AA800 Model, Perkin-Elmer Corporation, Norwalk, USA). Quality control of the measurements was performed using the reference material randox assay human serum level 2 (Randox, Antrim, UK). Internal pooled plasma control was run with each batch of sample. Plasma α-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were quantified by immunoturbidimetry (automate A15, BioSystems S.A, Barcelona, Spain) using BioSystem enzymatic kits (BioSystem).</p>

Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation and percentage. Descriptive statistics were used to examine all variables. Baseline characteristics were compared by using student <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables and Pearson’s chi-square test for percentage. Linear regression models (for continuous variables) and analysis of variance (for categorical variables) were performed to assess factors associated with plasma zinc concentration. The variables assessed in relation to baseline plasma zinc concentration were as follows: elapsed time from last meal to blood draw, elapsed time from blood draw to centrifugation, elapsed time from centrifugation to separation of plasma, presence of visible hemolysis in the plasma sample, and presence of elevated CRP (≥5 mg/L) and elevated AGP (≥1.0 g/L). Analysis of covariance (univariate General Linear Model procedure) was used to compare changes in weight, BMI, fat free mass and hemoglobin among study groups, and in plasma zinc concentration, after adjustment for baseline plasma zinc concentration, CRP and AGP concentrations, and elapsed time between the previous food intake and the time of the blood sampling for the baseline and final blood draw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

Contrary to hemoglobin, the mean change in plasma zinc concentration was comparable between the RUTF group and the Control group (<italic>p =0.811</italic>). Mean plasma zinc concentrations in both groups did not differ from their respective baseline values (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present randomized control study was designed to evaluate the effect of consuming daily 100 g RUTF mixed with rice porridge as supplement on body composition, anemia and zinc status of hospitalized PLWH in Senegal during hospitalization and after 9 weeks home-based supplementation. A high prevalence of severe chronic malnutrition was detected among the Senegalese PLWH, and according to several authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the nutritional quality of the patients’ diets seems to be the immediate cause of this high prevalence of malnutrition, even thought others causes like decrease food consumption due to several factors, especially anorexia accompanying opportunistic infections, may be suspected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In this study, the standard hospital diet as well as diets provided by the relatives, even fortified with a vegetable soup was unable to cover the patients’ needs. Improving the diet with a high-energy dense fortified supplement, consisting of 100 g RUTF mixed with rice porridge improved significantly the diet in term of energy, vitamins (B complex vitamins except for biotin, C, D, E, and minerals intakes (zinc, selenium, cooper, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium). Low serum levels of calcium, potassium, and magnesium have been reported in HIV-infected population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In contrast, high plasma concentration of copper was founded early in the course of HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], due to the increase of this mineral during the acute-phase response in a variety of infections and inflammatory conditions. However, the effect of supplementation with these minerals on HIV population was poorly investigated and requires further research.</p>
      <p>The daily recommended intake of vitamin A in our patients was covered by consumption of a vegetable-based soup prepared by the hospital and rich in beta-carotene. But we did not investigated the others nutrients in the soup. The home diet of the patients was not measured but it is expected the vitamin A stores gained during hospitalization remains for several weeks.</p>
      <p>This was not the case for iron. During hospitalization, iron intake from the patients’ diet was very low as well as the iron content of 100 g RUTF. Although the supplementation increased a bit the iron intake of the RUTF group, it did not reach the daily recommended intake, and all the positive effects on the hemoglobin level in this group cannot be assigned to iron intake. In a previous study from our laboratory (unpublished data), we showed that Senegalese outpatients PLWH with anemia were not iron deficient according to their plasma ferritin concentration or serum transferrin receptor. In the present study, the prevalence of anemia was and remained high after 9 weeks follow-up in both groups, and these results are similar to those reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The failure of erythropoiesis is generally considered as the primary physiopathological mechanism of anemia in HIV-associated opportunistic infections, micronutrient deficiencies, direct effect of HIV on erythropoiesis and tuberculosis mediated-anemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The positive effect of the RUTF supplementation on hemoglobin and the significant reduction of the anemic patients in the RUTF group at 9 weeks were not correlated with their iron intake. It is reported that iron supplementation have a negative effect on HIV-infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In our study, the iron intake from the supplement was very low (2.9 mg/day) and was not expected to have similar negative affects when high dose of iron (30 to 60 mg/day) were administrated. This result suggests an anabolic effect of other micronutrients from the RUTF, perhaps increased intakes of B12 and folic acid. The positive effect of vitamins B complex on wasting has been demonstrated by several authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Irlam et al., in the recent Cochrane review showed that multivitamin supplementation trial increased weight gain in PLWH co-infected with TB and HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These results of vitamins on wasting could be related to their effects at various levels of immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Furthermore, recent studies support beneficial effects of micronutrient supplementation (vitamin B complex, vitamin C and E) at RDA level in HIV-infected people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p>
      <p>At the end of the hospitalization period, any beneficial effect of the supplementation was observed on body composition but after 9 weeks home supplementation, the change in body composition was highly significant from baseline (+11 % body mass). The increase in fat free mass in the RUTF group could be explained by the increase coverage of certain nutrients, particularly vitamins and minerals. It could also result from the reduction of opportunistic infections during hospitalization. Infectious episodes are accompanied by increase protein catabolism which partially explains the high rate of severe malnutrition observed in our patients in both groups, and their low initial fat free mass. Also, multivitamins could directly avert muscle loss by decreasing the oxidative stress that has been found to result in muscle wasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, in the present study, reduction of .opportunistic infections was observed in the RUTF as well as in the Control, since it was the discharge criteria from the hospital. Therefore, it is more likely that the significant improvement in body composition in the RUTF group compared to the Control group can be assigned to the supplement. Increase of fat free mass has been reported by others authors even with lower dose of RUTF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Diouf et al. in a study on adults outpatients PLWH supplemented with 43 g of RUTF per day showed an increase in fat free mass of about 7.7 % after 6 months of supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. With higher dose of RUTF (245 g of RUTF/d) over a period of 3.5 months, Ndekha et al. also demonstrate an increase in lean mass, but, in contrast with our study, food consumption was not measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In the present study, the percentage increase in fat free mass after 3 months of supplementation was 11.8 % indicating that an unbalance diets supplemented with 100 g RUTF can lead to a significant positive effect on muscle mass without increasing the % body fat. These results suggested that the energy intake of 100 g RUTF (an energy dense fortified food) is sufficient to optimize the use of other nutrients that causes a significant gain in body mass, probably because the amount of energy supplied by 100 g RUTF (&gt;500 kcal). It is well known that energy density is a determinant of food consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and can increase the chances of nutritional recovery of severely malnourished HIV-infected patients in sub Saharan Africa with BMI less than 17 kg/m<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Yet, the vitamin/mineral content of 100 g RUTF as food complement needs more investigations according to local diet habits. We showed in the present study that such quantity is well accepted by PLWH and has positive effect on their nutritional status.</p>
      <p>The prevalence of zinc deficiency was high (50 %) in both groups although the supplement had covered the zinc requirements in the RUTF group. High prevalence of zinc deficiency in PLWH has been reported by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In the present study, zinc intake was increased with the supplementation to more than one RDA of zinc as recommended by WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. RUTF is a zinc-fortified food but the fortification was not reflected on the plasma zinc concentration of the patients. This result suggested that either one RDA is not enough to cover the zinc requirement of PLWH, or the concentration of plasma zinc does not reflect zinc status during fortification contrary to zinc supplementation. In our laboratory, we have demonstrated that plasma zinc concentration increased in children and adults who received daily zinc supplementation for a short time but not in those who received a zinc-fortified food containing a similar amount of zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Also, Mocchegiani et al. showed that zinc supplementation with 3 times the RDA increases significantly the plasma zinc of PLWH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The question remains open and needs additional studies to assess the usefulness of plasma zinc as biomarker of zinc fortification. Moreover, the disturbance in the homeostasis of zinc, particularly, the redistribution of zinc to the liver and the presence of inflammatory cytokines or proteins may be implicated in the etiology of zinc deficiency among PLWH as well as the use of zinc for the expression of genes and the replication of HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Severe chronic malnutrition is highly prevalent among Senegalese hospitalized PLWH with a significant loss of fat free mass. The patient’s usual diet did not cover most of the nutrient requirements, including energy. Improving this diet with a supplement consisting of 100 g RUTF (a high energy dense fortified food) mixed in rice allowed to cover the RDA of many micronutrients including zinc for PLWH. The supplement had a positive effect on body composition by increasing the amount of lean and fat mass and maintaining % body fat. Within the supplemented group, food + treatment were better at restoring fat free mass and resolving anemia than treatment alone. The anemic status of the patients was also significantly improved despite a low iron intake. It is possible that the supplement has improved the zinc status of the PLWH (fat free mass deposit increased), but we were unable to confirm such improvement as their plasma zinc concentration failed to reflect it. Research is needed to identify more sensitive indicator of zinc status in PLWH in response to zinc fortification. However, from the overall results, this study, we would like to recommend supplementation of adult PLWH with 100 g RUTF in the early stage of the infection.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Acaricide failure has been on the rise in the western and central cattle corridor of Uganda. In this study, we identified the tick species associated with acaricide failure and determined their susceptibility to various acaricide molecules used for tick control in Uganda.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>In this cross sectional study, tick samples were collected and identified to species level from 54 purposively selected farms (from 17 districts) that mostly had a history of acaricide failure. Larval packet test was used to screen 31 tick populations from 30 farms for susceptibility at discriminating dose (DD) and 2 × DD of five panels of commercial acaricide molecules belonging to the following classes; amidine, synthetic pyrethroid (SP), organophosphate (OP) and OP-SP co-formulations (COF). Resistance was assessed based on World Health Organization criteria for screening insecticide resistance.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Of the 1357 ticks identified, <italic>Rhipicephalus</italic> (<italic>Rhipicephalus</italic>) <italic>appendiculatus</italic> and <italic>Rhipicephalus</italic> (<italic>Boophilus</italic>) <italic>decoloratus</italic> were the major (95.6 %) tick species in farms sampled. Resistance against SP was detected in 90.0 % (27/30) of the tick populations tested. Worryingly, 60.0 % (18/30) and 63.0 % (19/30) of the above ticks were super resistant (0 % mortality) against 2 × DD cypermethrin and deltamethrin, respectively. Resistance was also detected against COF (43.3 %), OP chlorfenvinphos (13.3 %) and amitraz (12.9 %). In two years, 74.1 % (20/27) of the farms had used two to three acaricide molecules, and 55.6 % (15/27) rotated the molecules wrongly. Multi-acaricide resistance (at least 2 molecules) was detected in 55.2 % (16/29) of the resistant <italic>Rhipicephalus</italic> ticks and significantly associated with <italic>R. decoloratus</italic> (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0133), use of both SP and COF in the last 2 years (p &lt; 0.001) and Kiruhura district (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0339). Despite emergence of amitraz resistance in the greater Bushenyi area, it was the most efficacious molecule against SP and COF resistant ticks.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>This study is the first to report emergence of super SP resistant and multi-acaricide resistant <italic>Rhipicephalus</italic> ticks in Uganda. Amitraz was the best acaricide against SP and COF resistant ticks. However, in the absence of technical interventions, farmer-led solutions aimed at troubleshooting for efficacy of multitude of acaricides at their disposal are expected to potentially cause negative collateral effects on future chemical tick control options, animal welfare and public health.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Ticks are one of the leading vectors of diseases of economic importance to the livestock industry in Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Tick-borne diseases (TBD) mainly theileriosis/East Coast fever (ECF), babesiosis and anaplasmosis present serious constraints to productivity of especially exotic cattle and their crosses. In Uganda, over 30 % of calf crop is lost to TBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The above diseases also account for nearly 90 % of total disease control costs and over 60 % of total farm inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To address tick challenge, commercial cattle farmers rely extensively on acaricides for chemical control of ticks. This has created a huge demand and market for acaricides in Uganda. The liberalization of the veterinary drug industry in the country has made acaricides even more accessible to farmers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Because of limited control, cases of irrational use of acaricides by farmers have been widely reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Wrong dilution, application methods and increased acaricide pressure are amongst factors that accelerate development of acaricide resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Acaricide resistance was first reported in Uganda in 1970 against organochlorine toxaphene by <italic>Rhipicephalus</italic> (<italic>Boophilus</italic>) <italic>decoloratus</italic> and <italic>Rhipicephalus evertsi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The lack of tick acaricide resistance monitoring system since early 1990’s to date implies that the performance of various molecules on the Ugandan market are unknown. However, the increased cases of farmers’ complaints on acaricide failure, especially in western and central cattle corridors, raises serious suspicion of possible emergence of acaricide resistant ticks in the country. In the rest of the world, tick resistance to various classes of acaricides has been extensively reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Most of the studies reported acaricide resistance against one class of molecules. However, cases of multiple acaricide resistance by <italic>Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus</italic> have been reported in Mexico [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Several methods have been proposed for detection of acaricide resistance. Larval packet test (LPT), larval tarsal test (LTT) and adult immersion test (AIT) are among the common tests used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, the limitations associated with the above tests such as high labour and time requirements have resulted in the introduction of genomic based approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Nevertheless, the high costs of genomic approaches leaves LPT as the most used tool for routine acaricide resistance screening. This is further consolidated by the greater agreement between LPT and genomic tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The current study established the common species of ticks associated with acaricide failure, acaricide use practices and determined the acaricide resistance profile of the ticks using LPT.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <sec id="Sec3">
        <title>Study area</title>
        <p>The primary study area for this research were cattle farms in western and central Uganda that were experiencing acaricide failure between December 2013 and January 2015. Western and central Uganda have the highest population of exotic cattle (especially dairy breeds) and their crosses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Due to the susceptibility of the improved breeds, farmers have to rely on extensive use of acaricides for tick control and prevention of TBD. A total of 14 districts from central and western Uganda were included in this study. They were identified during an earlier investigation of complaints of acaricide failure by the National Drug Authority of Uganda and our research team. Thus, the farms from central (16 farms) and western (34 farms) Uganda were purposively sampled based on history of acaricide failure reported to the respective district veterinary office and animal health workers. However, 4 additional samples were obtained from 1 district in the north (Gulu) and 2 districts in the eastern (Serere and Mbale) parts of Uganda. The sample from Gulu was collected from cattle in the abattoir to establish possible spread of resistant ticks through cattle trade. The tick samples from Mbale were collected electively for purposes of finding a reference susceptible tick. Overall ticks were collected from 54 study sites designated as farms in this study (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec4">
        <title>Tick collection</title>
        <p>Ticks were collected from 6 to 20 randomly sampled cattle per farm although dogs were also included for tick collection in farms that had dogs. Ticks were collected from goats and sheep on one farm in Kampala. Cattle, goats and sheep were restrained and inspected for ticks in the various predilection sites. Dogs on the other hand were restrained by the owner before tick samples were picked. Both engorged and semi-engorged ticks from each farm were carefully picked and put in perforated labelled sample bottles and transported to the Central Diagnostic laboratory (CDL) at the College of Veterinary Medicine, Animal Resources and Biosecurity (COVAB), Makerere University for taxonomic identification, hatching and acaricide efficacy assays.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec5">
        <title>Taxonomic identification of tick samples</title>
        <p>Ticks were identified to species level based on morphological features described by Walker <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For each farm, identified ticks were categorized based on their species to determine the dominant species associated with acaricide failure at farm and district levels. The engorged female ticks were immediately transferred into individual tubes and incubated at 27 ± 1 °C and 80 % relative humidity for oviposition. After hatching, the larvae were kept in the incubator until they were 18 days old and used for acaricide efficacy assays.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec6">
        <title>Acaricides used for tick resistance assay</title>
        <p>Commercial acaricide formulations that represented all the classes of acaricide on Ugandan market were purchased from the local importers and used for LPT. They were coded as; A4 (12.5 % amitraz, Kenya), SP3 (10 %, α-cypermethrin, Kenya), SP10 (5 %, deltamethrin, Tunisia), OP (100 %, chlorfenvinphos, Italy), COF1 (co-formulation, 30 % chlorfenvinphos and 3 % α-cypermethrin, Italy). The commercial (brand) names of the acaricides used were coded for anonymity to avoid any misinterpretation as promotion or demotion of such products based on their efficacy result.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec7">
        <title>Tick bioassays for acaricide efficacy</title>
        <p>A total of 31 tick populations from 30 farms were tested for acaricide susceptibility. For logistical reasons, we adopted the method proposed for insecticide resistance testing by World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The manufacturers recommended concentration was considered as the diagnostic/discriminating dose (DD) for all the chemicals. However, one additional dose level, which was twice the above dose (2 × DD) was also applied. The diluent used for all the acaricides was trichloroethylene and olive oil mixed in a ratio of 2:1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For amitraz, the method by Miller <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] was used. Briefly, 0.25 mg/ml (DD) and 0.5 mg/ml (2 × DD) commercial amitraz were prepared using the diluent. For cypermethrin and deltamethrin, 0.05 mg/ml (DD) and 0.1 mg/ml (2 × DD) respectively were prepared. For OP-chlorfenvinphos 0.5 mg/ml (DD) and 1 mg/ml (2 × DD) were prepared for the bioassays. The concentration of the coformulation prepared were 0.3:0.03 mg/ml (DD) and 0.6:0.06 mg/ml (2 × DD).</p>
        <p>The choice of substrate used for impregnation of the chemicals was based on Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] recommendation. Filter paper (Whatman No.1, Whatman, Madstone, United Kingdom) was used as a substrate for cypermethrin, deltamethrin, chlorfenvinphos and co-formulated acaricide. Nylon fabric was used for amitraz. The substrates were labelled with pencil and impregnated with 0.7 ml of the corresponding acaricide solution prepared. Trichloroethylene was evaporated in a fume hood for 2 hours. Each impregnated filter paper or nylon fabric was folded into a packet and loaded with, on average, 60 larvae from the same farm and same species. The packets were then secured with alligator clips and incubated at 29 ±1 °C and 80 % relative humidity for 24 hours. Each experiment was carried out in duplicate. In all the assays, contamination was avoided by starting every experiment with the negative control followed by the lower concentration and changing gloves between different acaricide molecules. In the absence of laboratory reference susceptible <italic>Rhipicephalus</italic> ticks in the country, <italic>Haemaphysalis leachi</italic> and <italic>Amblyoma variegatum</italic> larvae that were 100 % susceptible to all the acaricides were taken as reference ticks for phenotypic acaricide resistance assay. The reliability of this approach was later verified using 6 populations of susceptible <italic>R. appendiculatus</italic> and <italic>R. decoloratus</italic> reference ticks collected from low acaricide pressure farms in Adjumani district-north western Uganda (Unpublished data).</p>
        <p>After 24 hours, the packets were removed in the order in which they were loaded in the incubator. Three independent enumerators who were previously trained on identifying dead and live ticks using a magnifying lens and stereo-microscope counted the number of ticks that died and those that were alive for each set of experiments. Mortalities were expressed as percentage of the total number of larvae exposed to the acaricide. There were no mortalities recorded in the control groups that were exposed to only the diluent.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="Sec8">
        <title>Data on acaricide application practices</title>
        <p>A semi-structured interview with farmers and/or farm workers was carried out from 52 of the 54 farms since data could not be retrieved from the two farms. The data captured included breeds of cattle reared, sequence of acaricide brands used in the last two years, method of acaricide application, dilution of acaricide(s) used, application interval at the time of the study and mixing of two or more acaricide formulations at one time. The data on sequence and brands of acaricides were used to determine the correctness of rotation from one molecule to another. Rotation was considered wrong if a farmer changed acaricide brand within the same molecule and changing from COF to SP following acaricide failure. However, a change from synthetic pyrethroid (SP) to co-formulation (COF) and organophosphate (OP) molecule following acaricide failure to SP was also considered a wrong rotation due to the possible cross-resistance between SP and OP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The farm data on acaricide usage was also used to establish the brand preference for the different acaricide molecules on the market. The registration status of various brands of acaricides stated by the farmers was either established from National Drug Authority or verified using the National Drug Authority’s Veterinary Register (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nda.or.ug/docs/Vet_List.pdf">http://www.nda.or.ug/docs/Vet_List.pdf</ext-link>).</p>

      <sec id="Sec9">
        <title>Data analysis</title>
        <p>The mortality data for the 31 tick populations tested were recorded in MS excel and mean mortality and standard error determined. The WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] percentage mortality cut-off values for susceptibility and resistance against insecticides determined using DD were used to categorize the mortality data. Ticks that showed at least 80 % mortality were considered susceptible while those that showed less than 80 % mortality against a given chemical were considered resistant. The above data together with the qualitative data on acaricide use was analysed using SPSS version 21 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Pearson chi square analysis was done with MedCalc for Windows, version 12.5 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium) to determine the factors associated with multiple acaricide resistance at 95 % confidence and <italic>p</italic> value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

        <p>The study was approved by the institutional review board (No. VAB/REC/15/104) of the College of Veterinary Medicine, Animal Resources and Biosecurity, Makerere University. To ensure biosecurity of ticks, all experiments were carried out under strict in-house procedure for avoiding escape of larvae. All materials used were either autoclaved or soaked in hot water at 99 °C. Larvae that were kept for further molecular studies were preserved in 70 % ethanol. The commercial (brand) names of all the acaricides were coded to ensure confidentiality.</p>

        <p>Of the 54 cattle farms from which ticks were collected, 83.3 % (45/54) kept crosses of exotic cattle and 9/54 had only local cattle as the main livestock enterprise. Up to 90.4 % (47/52) of the farms used hand spray for acaricide application while only 3.8 % (2/52) used plunge dip and another 1.9 % (1/52) used spray race. Complaint of acaricide failure was reported in 94.4 % (51/54) of the farms that were all located in central and western Uganda. A total of 1357 ticks were identified from the 54 study farms. <italic>Rhipicephalus</italic> ticks accounted for 95.6 % (1297/1357) of the tick populations although <italic>A.variegatum</italic> and <italic>H. leachi</italic> constituted 3.5 % (48/1357) and 0.9 % (12/1357), respectively. Amongst the <italic>Rhipicephalus,</italic> 55.1 % (715/1297) were the one host ticks <italic>R. decoloratus</italic> compared to 44.9 % (582/1297) three host tick <italic>Rhipicephalus appendiculatus.</italic> On the other hand, 70.8 % (34/48) of the <italic>A. variegatum</italic> ticks were from eastern Uganda (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

        <title>Acaricide molecules and brand preferences by farmers</title>
        <p>The veterinary drug register showed that a total of 25 commercial brands of acaricides had been marketed in Uganda. Synthetic pyrethroids (SP1-SP15) constituted 60.0 % (15/25) of the total commercial brands marketed, followed by amitraz (A1-A7 brands) 28.0 % (7/25), co-formulation (COF1-COF2) 8.0 % (2/25) and only one brand of mono-formulated organophosphate was registered. However, 68.0 % (17/25) of the commercial brands of acaricide registered were found to have been used in the study farms. Overall, amitraz accounted for 36.9 % (48/130) of the total acaricide formulations used for tick control followed by COF 30.0 % (39/130), SP 27.7 % (36/130) and mono-formulated OP 5.4 % (7/130) being the least used class of acaricide. Within the same molecule, clear brand preferences were recorded. For example two brands of amitraz (A3 and A4), four brands of SP (SP1, SP2, SP3 and SP13) and 1 brand of COF (COF1) were preferred by 75.0 % (36/48), 69.4 % (25/36) and 71.8 % (28/39) of the farmers, respectively. The majority of the farmers (81.3 %, <italic>n</italic> = 48) used at least two classes of acaricides within the last 2 years. Acaricide registration pattern showed that the rapid influx of different acaricide brands began in 1997 and its climax was attained in 2007. Between 1997 and 1998, all the three classes of acaricides (amidine, SP and OP) were on the Ugandan market suggesting that they have been in use for over 16 years in Uganda (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Acaricide molecules registered in Uganda and report of their use by the farmers</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th rowspan="2">Brand names, total number and % freq.</th><th rowspan="2">Generic name</th><th rowspan="2">Dilution (acaricide (ml: water (liters))</th><th rowspan="2">Concentration (%)</th><th rowspan="2">Freq. of use by farmers in study area</th><th rowspan="2">% within class</th><th rowspan="2">Overall %</th><th rowspan="2">Year licensed by NDA</th></tr><tr><th>Classification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Amidine</td><td>A1</td><td>Amitraz</td><td>2:1</td><td>12.5</td><td>1</td><td>2.1</td><td>0.8</td><td>2000</td></tr><tr><td/><td>A2</td><td>Amitraz</td><td>2:1</td><td>12.5</td><td>8</td><td>16.7</td><td>6.2</td><td>2001</td></tr><tr><td/><td>A3</td><td>Amitraz</td><td>2:1</td><td>12.5</td><td>25</td><td>52.1</td><td>19.2</td><td>1998</td></tr><tr><td/><td>A4</td><td>Amitraz</td><td>2:1</td><td>12.5</td><td>11</td><td>22.9</td><td>8.5</td><td>1997</td></tr><tr><td/><td>A5</td><td>Amitraz</td><td>2:1</td><td>12.5</td><td>3</td><td>6.3</td><td>2.3</td><td>1997</td></tr><tr><td/><td>A6</td><td>Amitraz</td><td>2:1</td><td>12.5</td><td>0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>1998</td></tr><tr><td/><td>A7</td><td>Amitraz</td><td>2:1</td><td>12.5</td><td>0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>2007</td></tr><tr><td>Sub-total</td><td>7 (28.0)</td><td/><td/><td/><td>48</td><td>100.0</td><td>36.9</td><td/></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Synthetic Pyrethroid</td><td>SP1</td><td>α-Cypermethrin</td><td>1:1</td><td>5.0</td><td>8</td><td>22.2</td><td>6.2</td><td>2002</td></tr><tr><td>SP2</td><td>α-Cypermethrin</td><td>1:1</td><td>5.0</td><td>5</td><td>13.9</td><td>3.8</td><td>1998</td></tr><tr><td/><td>SP3</td><td>α-Cypermethrin</td><td>1:2</td><td>10.0</td><td>7</td><td>19.4</td><td>5.4</td><td>2009</td></tr><tr><td/><td>SP4</td><td>α-Cypermethrin</td><td>1:1</td><td>7.0</td><td>3</td><td>8.3</td><td>2.3</td><td>2011</td></tr><tr><td/><td>SP5</td><td>Cypermethrin</td><td>1:1</td><td>10.0</td><td>1</td><td>2.8</td><td>0.8</td><td>1998</td></tr><tr><td/><td>SP6</td><td>Cypermethrin</td><td>1:1</td><td>10.0</td><td>0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>1998</td></tr><tr><td/><td>SP7</td><td>Cypermethrin</td><td>1:1</td><td>15.0</td><td>0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>2007</td></tr><tr><td/><td>SP8</td><td>Cypermethrin</td><td>1:1</td><td>10.0</td><td>0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>2005</td></tr><tr><td/><td>SP9<sup>a</sup>

        <p>As shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, all (100 %) of the amitraz brands available on the market had a concentration of 12.5 % (wt/vol.). However, 13/15 of the brands of synthetic pyrethroids licensed as emulsified concentrates had concentrations ranging from 2 to 15 %. The 38.5 % (5/13) of synthetic pyrethroid brands were 5 % (wt/vol.) followed by 10 % wt.vol (4/13), 2 % wt/vol. (2/13), 7 % wt/vol (1/13) and 15 % wt/vol (1/15). Moreover, aside from one molecule, the rest were prescribed in a dilution ratio of acaricide to water of 1 ml: 1liter, giving a wide concentration range for chemical tick control in Uganda. Similarly, the two co-formulations on the market had a wide concentration range despite the same dilution ratio of acaricide to water of 1:2 (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p>

          <p>At DD, 90.0 % (27/30) of the ticks tested were resistant to both cypermethrin and deltamethrin. Doubling the concentration (2 × DD) of both chemicals did not cause any significant increase in mortality of the above ticks since 86.7 % (26/30) remained resistant (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Moreover at 2 × DD, 60.0 % (18/30) and 63.3 % (19/30) were super resistant (0 % mortality) against cypermethrin and deltamethrin, respectively.

        <title>Farm practices aimed at mitigating acaricide failure</title>
        <p>To overcome acaricide failure, various coping strategies have been adopted by farmers although they were considered to potentially worsen the existing tick challenge. Buying different brand(s) of acaricide with little or no regard to similarity in active molecules with previous brand(s) used on the same farm was encountered. In two years, 74.1 % (20/27) of the farms whose tick acaricide resistance status was determined used two to three acaricide molecules, and 55.6 % (15/27) rotated the molecules wrongly. Rotation within the same molecule through purchase of different brands was recorded in 40.7 % (11/27) of the farms. In addition, 25.9 % (7/27) of the farmers increased the concentration of acaricide at least twice over the recommended strength. Some 14.8 % (4/27) of the farmers shortened acaricide application interval to twice a week (every three days). This translates into approximately 10 exposures every month and 120 exposures annually. Mixing of two different acaricide formulations was encountered in 7 % (2/27) of farms and one of the farms mixed co-formulation and amitraz, thus exposing ticks to all the three molecules at once. In a farm that mixed two acaricides and sprayed twice every week, damage to the skin of cattle due to frequent spraying with higher acaricide strength was encountered. As a result, the ticks were easily picked with the damaged skin (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This is the first report that has comprehensively investigated tick acaricide resistance since the introduction of synthetic pyrethroid, co-formulations and amitraz in Uganda. <italic>Rhipicephalus</italic> ticks are widespread in the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], posing a serious threat especially to exotic cattle. Thus TBD especially ECF is ranked by farmers as the most important constraint to cattle production in Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Acaricides are therefore perceived as the most efficient way of controlling ticks and preventing the above diseases. However, with over 25 brands of all the major classes of acaricides circulating on the market (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), farmers are “spoiled for choice”. SP and amitraz accounted for 88 % of the total acaricide brands marketed although amitraz was the most preferred by farmers during the study. This finding is consistent with what was previously reported in north eastern Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Of concern was the variation in strength of the different SP whose dilutions are similar, thus giving different concentrations. It may be possible that amongst cypermethrin, variation in strength may reflect the proprietary difference in composition of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> isomers. However, there is need for regulatory harmonization of strength of SP formulations with similar active ingredients, notwithstanding inappropriate application practices by farmers. A noticeable example of inappropriate acaricide use was wrong rotation of acaricides between molecules and rotation of acaricides within the same molecule under different brand names. It was also widely believed by farmers that acaricide failure could only be caused by “fake” chemicals. This clearly indicates that farmers lacked knowledge on possibility of ticks becoming resistant to chemicals due irrational acaricide use.</p>
      <p>In this study, 93.5 % (29/31) of the larval population tested had resistance to at least one class of acaricide molecule; all of them belonging to the genus <italic>Rhipicephalus</italic>. In Uganda, acaricide resistance was first diagnosed in <italic>Rhipicephalus</italic> ticks against organochlorine, toxaphen in 1970s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This occurred mainly due to increased acaricide pressure considering a compulsory tick control committee enforced weekly dipping of cattle across the country. However, subsequent zoning of acaricides and restricting circulation to the district veterinary office were reported as efficient strategies in delaying acaricide resistance. Nevertheless, political strife in early 1970s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and further liberalization of the veterinary drug sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] ended both zoning and control in supply of acaricides leading to widespread inappropriate acaricide use. Of major concern now is the high level of resistance to SP (90 %) and emergence of super resistant <italic>R. appendiculatus</italic> and <italic>R. decoloratus</italic> ticks in at least 60 % of the tick populations investigated in this study (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Since their introduction, SP have enjoyed unique preference due to their dual effect against both ticks and flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, its irrational use for over 16 years especially by farmers who use the spray method, could have selected for stable resistance. Studies carried out in related tick-<italic>R. microplus</italic> have attributed such level of resistance to multiple mutations in SP target site, voltage sensitive sodium channel domains II and III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] . A similar level of resistance was first observed in insects and attributed to knock down resistance (<italic>kdr</italic>) in the sodium channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. It should be noted that the prevalence of SP resistance by <italic>Rhipicephalus</italic> ticks (96.4 %) reported in this study is amongst the highest compared to those previously known in South America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and the rest of Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Possible evidence of cross-resistance between SP and OP was also observed in 30 % of the tick populations from farms that used co-formulated acaricides. Previous studies in cattle tick showed that ticks that were resistant to SP and OP had elevated esterase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The apparent lack of synergism between SP and OP observed in this study possibly emanates from the fact that the most dominant co-formulation used in Uganda (COF1) is prescribed at 1.7 times lower concentration than their corresponding mono-formulations. While the pharmacological basis for such formula is justifiable under ideal conditions, its efficacy is bound to be low in a situation where resistance has emerged against one of the chemicals. This eventually could act as a recipe for emergence of resistance against what otherwise would be the effective molecule (OP) in the co-formulation due to sub-optimal exposure dose. This possibly explains the low efficacy recorded against OP in farms with SP resistant ticks that were also previously exposed to co-formulated acaricides. The mono-formulated OP chlorfenvinphos showed promising efficacy, partly because it is not widely used. The low farm use may be attributed to factors such as shorter application interval recommended for its use and low margin of safety compared to other classes of acaricides. However, emergence of resistance against co-formulation containing OP is an early indication that resistance to this group of acaricides is progressively building amidst fear of possible cross-resistance with SP.</p>
      <p>Amitraz resistance was the least detected (12.9 %) in the current study thus corroborating with the findings on in its use at farm level. This finding is consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Although amitraz formulations have been the dominantly mentioned acaricides (36.9 %), their routine use has remained low due to their narrow spectrum of benefit compared to SP, as far as fly repellence is concerned. This explains why some farmers irrationally mixed amitraz and SP formulations. On the other hand, the increase in amitraz use may be an indicator that farmers were getting better tick control results with amitraz following negative experience while using SP and COF. However, the resistance observed against amitraz in 12.9 % of the tick populations may be mediated by mutation in the amitraz target, octopamine receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Nevertheless, the high level of multi-acaricide resistance (55.2 %) and emergence of isolated amitraz resistance ticks further emphasizes the need for accelerated intervention to combat their spread across the country. The super SP resistant <italic>R. appendiculatus</italic> collected in Gulu abattoir from cattle bought from central Uganda should be an example of how such ticks can be easily spread through cattle trade and/or movement. Therefore, creation of farm awareness, vigilance amongst veterinarians and cattle traders, and promoting use of amidines in farming communities with ticks that are resistant to SP and coformulation could potentially lead to containment of resistant tick populations. However, the use of amitraz should factor into account the balance between need for tick and tsetse fly control, especially in areas that are known to be tsetse infested as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In the absence of technical intervention, coping strategies employed by farmers experiencing acaricide failure are likely to worsen the existing challenge. This includes exponential rise in irrational admixing of various acaricide formulations into cocktail and short application intervals that will cause collateral damage to cattle (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2), food safety and public health. Although alternative technologies such as vaccination of cattle with Muguga cocktail ECF vaccine is being promoted and said to be effective against ECF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], the emergence of acaricide resistant <italic>R. decoloratus</italic> undermines such efforts. Without controlling the above ticks, babesiosis and anaplasmosis will certainly cause economic losses despite immunization against ECF. Therefore, there is need for various actors in the animal industry to jointly identify strategies for mitigation of acaricide resistance in Uganda. This, however, requires close collaboration between the various stakeholders in the acaricide supply chain and research animal health institutions in the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>This research is the first in Uganda to report emergence of super SP resistant and multi-acaricide resistant <italic>R. appendiculatus</italic> and <italic>R. decoloratus</italic> ticks. Our results further highlight the importance of routine monitoring of tick acaricide resistance for early detection and intervention especially in countries where veterinary drugs/acaricides are liberalized. In absence of technical interventions, farmer-led solutions aimed at troubleshooting for efficacy of the multitude of acaricides at their disposal are expected to potentially cause negative collateral effect on future chemical tick control options, animal welfare and public health. While understanding the molecular basis of such resistance and countrywide epidemiological studies are necessary, a multi-faceted approach directed towards containment and eradication of acaricide resistant ticks is urgently needed in Uganda.</p>

          <title>Backgrounds</title>
          <p>Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which implies the occurrence of cardiac dysfunction, impacts cardiac prognosis, even after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This study was designed to clarify the difference of clinical and angiographic predictors for reduced LVEF in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients with left anterior descending artery (LAD) or non-LAD vessel as culprit artery.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>This was a retrospective study to review a total of 553 patients of STEMI underwent primary PCI in our hospital. All patients underwent echocardiography. Univariate analysis, multivariate analysis and classification and regression tree (CART) were performed between LAD related AMI and non-LAD related STEMI. The primary outcome was the occurrence of reduced LVEF 4–6 days after PCI.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>In this study, culprit arteries of STEMI were 315 in LAD system (6 in left main artery, 309 in LAD) and 238 in non-LAD system (63 in left circumflex and 175 in right coronary artery). Compared with non-LAD group, post-MI LVEF was significantly reduced in LAD related STEMI group (52.4 ± 9.3 % vs. 57.1 ± 7.8 %, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Multivariate analysis indicated that elder (&gt;65 years), time to hospital and proximal occlusion were associated with reduced LVEF (&lt;55 %) in LAD related STEMI patients. However, in non-LAD patients, time to hospital, multivessel stenosis and post-PCI blood pressure predicted the occurrence of reduced LVEF. Furthermore, CART analysis also obtained similar findings.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Patients with LAD or non-LAD related STEMI could suffer reduced LVEF, while the clinical and angiographic predictors for the occurrence were different.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), which is significantly associated with cardiac dysfunction, occurs approximately in 30–40 % of patients who suffer ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Although the incidence of reduced LVEF after STEMI declined significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] because of great advancement in the treatment of anti-thrombotic therapy and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), it is still one of most critical complications after STEMI that carries a poor cardiac prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Reduced LVEF, which is common in STEMI patients with left main artery (LM) or left anterior descending artery (LAD) as culprit vessel. The occurrence was related to older ages, hypertension, diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], time to reperfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and higher prevalence of proximal occlusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The extent of acute myocardial damage in LAD occlusion is markedly larger than that in either left circumflex (LCX) or right coronary artery (RCA) occlusion. However, it has been also reported that reduced LVEF or cardiac dysfunction occurred in STEMI patients with RCA or LCX as culprit vessel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, it was unclear whether there were predictors difference for reduced LVEF between LAD-related and non-LAD-related STEMI.</p>
      <p>Given to the impact of new-onset cardiac dysfunction after STEMI on the cardiac prognosis, it is important to investigate the difference of clinical and angiographic predictors for reduced LVEF in STEMI patients with different culprit vessels. These findings will provide rapid prediction and beneficial effects on the early prevention of cardiac dysfunction after STEMI.</p>

        <title>Study population</title>
        <p>This was a retrospective clinical study to review the patients of acute STEMI underwent primary PCI (<italic>n</italic> = 664) in our hospital from Jul 2011 to Oct 2013. Baseline 12-lead electrocardiograms were performed at admission. A total of 553 patients were included in this study, while 111 patients were excluded according to follow exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were: (1) patients with 18 to 85 years of age; (2) diagnosed as acute STEMI; (3) underwent primary coronary intervention within 12 h after chest pain on-set. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) incomplete clinical history record (<italic>n</italic> = 23); (2) excluded the diagnosis of myocardial infarction by angiography, such as viral myocarditis, pericarditis or cardiomyopathy (<italic>n</italic> = 26); (3) not finish the detection of echocardiography in-hospitalization because of any reason (<italic>n</italic> = 17); (4) confirmed clinical heart failure before this admission, complicated with cardiomyopathy, congenital heart diseases and rheumatic heart disease (<italic>n</italic> = 19); (5) active chronic inflammation (<italic>n</italic> = 14); (6) dysfunction of hematological and immunological system (<italic>n</italic> = 4); (7) carcinoma or a condition treated with immunosuppressive agents (<italic>n</italic> = 8). This study and consent procedure were approved by our local ethics committee (Ethics Committee of Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Fudan University), and were carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Consent for publication of these data was obtained from each patient when they were admitted in our hospital.</p>
        <p>Several important clinical variables were record, such as age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, stable angina history, Time to hospital (from chest pain on-set to diagnosis) and D-to-B time (door to balloon).</p>

        <title>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention</title>
        <p>Prior to primary PCI, all patients received adequate loading doses of aspirin (300 mg) and clopidogrel (300 mg) or ticagrelor (180 mg) immediately after diagnosed as STEMI. Procedure of PCI was performed immediately via the femoral or radial access route. The characteristics of coronary angiography were record, such as culprit artery, acute occlusive segment and multi-vessel disease (defined as having at least another vessel with 75 % or greater stenosis except the culprit occlusion artery, such as culprit vessel in LAD had LCX or RCA or LM stenosis, culprit vessel in LCX had RCA or LAD or LM stenosis, culprit vessel in RCA had LCX or LAD or LM stenosis). A lesion was considered proximal if it was located proximal to the first diagonal branch in the LAD, the first obtuse marginal branch in LCX, or the first acute marginal branch in RCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
        <p>The usages of interventional techniques, thrombus aspiration and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor were chosen at the operators’ discretion. The phenomenon of no reflow or slow flow post-stenting was record. Post-PCI blood pressure, including systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), was detected by invasive blood pressure monitor from radial or femoral vascular sheaths.</p>

        <title>Echocardiography</title>
        <p>Echocardiography was performed before discharge (4–6 days post-PCI) in all patients using a Philips IE33 instrument (Philips, Netherlands) with a 2–3.5 MHz transducer (X3-1), while left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were detected by Simpson method. It was defined as reduced LVEF while LVEF less than 55 %. All exams were performed by one of three echocardiography operators. These three operators underwent standardized training before this study. Observers who detected LVEF were blinded to the results of coronary angiography and clinical record. The incidence of reduced LVEF after STEMI was compared between two different culprit artery systems, including LAD related STEMI (LM occlusion and LAD occlusion, <italic>n</italic> = 315) and non-LAD related STEMI (LCX occlusion, <italic>n</italic> = 63; RCA occlusion, <italic>n</italic> = 175).</p>

        <title>Reduced LVEF and predictor analysis</title>
        <p>In order to clarify the predictor difference for reduced LVEF in LAD system and non-LAD system groups, several clinical and angiographic predictors were analyzed by univariate analysis, shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which is mostly caused by coronary plaque rupture or erosion, could result in several clinical complications and impact cardiac prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Reduce LVEF or cardiac dysfunction occurs approximately in 30–40 % of patients who suffer STEMI, and the mortality of patients with post-MI cardiac dysfunction is 20 to 30 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As we know, reduced LVEF was common in STEMI patients with LM or LAD as culprit vessel. It has also been reported that reduced LVEF could occurred in patients with RCA or LCX as culprit vessel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, there were few studies focused on the risk factors or clinical predictors for reduced LVEF caused by RCA or LCX-related MI. Furthermore, it was unclear whether there were different clinical and angiographic characteristics between LAD and non-LAD-related STEMI with reduced LVEF.</p>
      <p>In this study, we confirmed the occurrence of reduced LVEF (LVEF &lt; 55 %) in non-LAD related MI patients, although this prevalence was lower than that in LAD related MI group (26.9 vs. 53.7 %, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). In order to clarify the difference of predictors between these two different culprit vessels, sub-group analyses and multivariate logistic analysis were also performed. We found that elder age, Time to hospital and proximal occlusion were critical for reduced LVEF in LAD related STEMI, while multi-vessel stenosis, Time to hospital and post-PCI blood pressure contributed most to reduce LVEF in non-LAD related STEMI.</p>
      <p>De Luca G reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] that elderly patients complicated with higher incidence of hypertension and diabetes, more advanced Killip class at presentation, longer time to treatment, higher prevalence of distal embolization and significantly impaired myocardial perfusion, which resulted in worse coronary microcirculation and higher mortality after STEMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], even undergoing primary angioplasty. Previously, few studies reported the different impact of older age on cardiac dysfunction between LAD and non-LAD related STEMI. In the LAD related MI, significantly impaired microcirculation and proximal occlusion directly resulted in more severe ischemia and large area of infarction, which exacerbated left ventricular systolic dysfunction. However, on the contrary, the extent of myocardial perfusion injury in non-LAD vessels contributes less to the left ventricular systolic function. In the non-LAD related MI, multivessel stenosis, which contained LAD stenosis, was more important for left ventricular function.</p>
      <p>Hypertension has also been one of well-established factors for increasing risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as acute myocardial infarction and heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Meanwhile, low admission blood pressure in MI patients has been suggested as a predictor for cardiac mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, it was unclear about the predictive value of post-PCI blood pressure on the risk of reduced LVEF between different culprit arteries. In our study, we found that lower post-PCI systolic (&lt;100 mmHg) or diastolic (&lt;60 mmHg) blood pressure indicated the higher incidence of reduced LVEF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). After adjusted by other factors, post-PCI systolic blood pressure was also independently associated with cardiac dysfunction in non-LAD related MI.</p>
      <p>As we know, reperfusion time to STEMI is one of the most important factors for short- and long-term cardiac prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In our study, there was no significant difference of D-to-B time between cardiac dysfunction and preserved function groups. However, time from chest pain on-set to diagnosis, defined as Time to hospital, was quite different between these two groups. As demonstrated in multivariable analysis, STEMI patients with Time to hospital more than 5 h had less LVEF no matter in LAD or non-LAD related STEMI groups, which could be resulted in more injured cardiomyocytes and higher risk of cardiac complications. CART analysis, which was analyzed based different risk factors’ subgroups, indicated rapid prediction for the occurrence of reduced LVEF.</p>
      <p>We should note some of our study’s limitations. First, the number of included patients was small size. Second, its retrospective nature limited its potency to clarify the cause relation between predictions and reduced LVEF. Third, the inclusion of LVEF in this study was only short-term data, therefore, long-term data will be needed to document the association between predictors and post-PCI LVEF. These limitations will be taken into account in our further clinical researches and prospective studies.</p>
