The following diagnosis codes were used for these analyses: benign neoplasm of brain and other parts of nervous system: 225.1 (cranial nerves, acoustic neuroma), 225.2 (cerebral meninges), 225.4 (spinal meninges); malignant neoplasm of other and unspecified parts of the nervous system: 192.1 (cerebral meninges), 192.3 (spinal meninges), 192.0 (cranial nerves); secondary malignant neoplasm of other specified sites: 198.4 (other parts of the nervous system, meninges (cerebral) (spinal)); neoplasm of uncertain behavior of endocrine glands and nervous system: 237.6 (neoplasm of uncertain behavior of endocrine glands and nervous system: meninges), 237.9 (other and unspecified parts of nervous system: cranial nerves); and disorders of the acoustic nerve: 388.5. In addition, we used the following brain tumor codes to assess whether associations between NF1 and neurological conditions (epilepsy, headache, migraine) remained when individuals with healthcare encounters related to brain tumor diagnoses were excluded (malignant neoplasm of brain: 191.0-191.9; benign neoplasm of brain and other parts of nervous system: 225.0-225.9; neoplasms of unspecified nature: 239.6 (brain)).Healthcare utilization was estimated from the number of outpatient visits using the CPTStatistical Analysis Software (SAS) (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for all study analyses. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to determine associations between NF1 group membership and each medical condition, adjusting for the frequency matching variables (enrollment time in months and age), sex, and number of healthcare visits. The latter was used to control for differences in healthcare utilization between the two study groups since there would be increased opportunity for medical condition claims in the NF1 group vs. the non-NF1 group due to their increased utilization of the healthcare system. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to evaluate the statistical significance of differences in the frequency of medical condition claims by sex between the NF1 and non-NF1 groups. The Wilcoxon two sample test (T approximation) was used to test the null hypothesis of no significant difference between the two groups in the age at first healthcare claim during the study period (2006-2010) for specific medical conditions. P-values were considered significant at the p&#8804;0.05 level.</chapter><chapter title="Results">A total of 8,579 people that met our selection criteria comprised the NF1 group. The non-NF1 comparison group consisted of 85,790 individuals. Subject ages ranged from 0-64 years, with a mean age of 24.4 years (SD= 19.3) for both groups (In general, subjects in the NF1 group had significantly higher odds of health insurance claims for all neurological conditions evaluated (To address the possibility that associations between NF1 and epilepsy, migraine, or headaches were mediated by brain tumors, we conducted analyses that excluded individuals with brain tumor claims. For epilepsy, the overall association was slightly weaker, but still significant (OR=6.7; 95% CI 5.8-7.8). Associations for headache (including migraine) and migraine were similar to the analyses that did not exclude these individuals (headache (including migraine): OR=2.7, 95% CI 2.4-2.9; migraine: OR=2.6, 95% CI 2.3-3.0).We also sought to determine whether there were any differences in the health insurance claims patterns for each medical condition as a function of age. As expected, there were no individuals in the younger age category in the NF1 group with claims for Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis. For other neurological conditions, the magnitude of the association was stronger for migraines, headache (includes migraine), and sleep disturbances/disorders in the younger vs. older age group, while the opposite was true for epilepsy.For each medical condition category, we also assessed whether there was any evidence for differences in the sex distribution and the mean age at first healthcare claim between the NF1 vs. the non-NF1 group (</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">We observed a significantly higher odds of healthcare claims related to epilepsy, migraine, headache (including migraine), sleep disorders, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease in individuals with NF1 than in those without NF1 who were identified using administrative claims data. These findings substantiate prior evidence from case reports and clinical series that have suggested causative associations between these neurological problems and NF1.An increased prevalence of epilepsy or unprovoked seizures in individuals with NF1 has been described in previous smaller studies, where the prevalence has been estimated between 5.9% and 9.5%NF1 has been evaluated as a risk factor for headache in studies surveying NF1 patients about headachesPrevious case reports have also revealed a potential association between NF1 and multiple sclerosis (MS)To our knowledge, there are only two published case reports of Parkinson's disease (PD) in individuals with NF1An increased prevalence of abnormal sleep patterns in people with NF1 has also been reportedUnexpectedly, we observed a significantly lower odds of diabetes-related healthcare claims in people with NF1 vs. the non-NF1 group. This inverse relationship is intriguing, and has been noted in an anecdotal expert reportStrengths of this study include its large size and the use of an age- and length of enrollment-matched comparison group that allows for more accurate estimation of relative differences in the prevalence of chronic neurological conditions in individuals with vs. without NF1. In addition, we controlled for healthcare utilization to minimize the concern that associations were confounded by this factor. The lack of an association between acute urinary tract infections and NF1 and the inverse association between diabetes and NF1 reinforces the concept that the positive associations detected between neurological conditions and NF1 were not due to increased surveillance for medical conditions in this population.There are also limitations to the use of administrative claims data. Using health insurance claims as markers of medical diagnoses (NF1 and comorbidities), rather than physical examinations and laboratory tests, may result in misclassification of individuals with respect to NF1. Misclassification can result from coding errors, coding to rule-out conditions, and under- and over-coding. We attempted to minimize misclassification through the application of strict selection criteria that are used in administrative data analyses by only considering individuals to have the chronic medical conditions if they had &#8805;2 codes for the condition in the outpatient/inpatient setting 30 or more days apart. However, we note that this approach could miss cases of NF1. In addition, it was recently recommended as a result of a systematic review of ICD codes for the study of neurological conditions that fewer than three ICD codes can be used with sufficient accuracy for identifying cases of epilepsy and MS in administrative data; insufficient data was found for PD to make recommendationsIn conclusion, this large administrative health insurance claims study strengthens existing evidence from uncontrolled studies that individuals with NF1 are at significantly elevated risk for a number of neurological conditions compared to the general population. In addition, our results suggest that individuals with NF1 are at lower risk for diabetes. Additional research will be required to validate these results, mechanistically study these associations, and identify the specific factors that distinguish individuals with NF1 who are at risk for these neurological complications.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4272688"><title>The Curveball as a Risk Factor for Injury</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Sports Health</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>W.

Of these, that by Lyman et alFive epidemiologic studies published between 2001 and 2011 were identified for inclusion: 1 case-control, 1 retrospective cohort, and 3 prospective cohort studies (All comparisons between curveball and fastball pitches were significant (A 2001 study utilizing postgame telephone interviews with 298 youth pitchers revealed no significant association between pitching a curveball and shoulder or elbow pain (While 3 of the 5 epidemiologic studies found no significant association between pitching a curveball and elbow or shoulder pain,Significantly less maximum pelvis angular velocity was found while pitching a curveball as compared with a fastball (560-590 vs 600-640 deg/s, respectively) (Five of the 10 biomechanical studies described the kinematics of the shoulder during the delivery of a curveball and fastball.One of the 4 kinetics studies found no differences at the shoulder joint in collegiate pitchers.Elbow kinematics in 4 studies involving collegiate pitchers (n = 6-40) show no significant differences between curveballs and fastballs (Electromyographic studies of pitchers&#8217; elbows examined the biceps, brachioradialis, and triceps maximum muscle activity during 4 phases of the pitching motion. Sisto et alThe first kinetic study in 1979 demonstrated inconsistent measures of normalized elbow forces, with 2 adult pitchers showing increased forces at the elbow and 2 others showing decreased forces when throwing a curveball.Seven of 8 studies of forearm position in pitching found greater supination with the curveball than the fastball, with differences ranging from 7.3&#176; to 19.8&#176; particularly at arm-cocking and acceleration phases.Collegiate pitchers did not demonstrate a difference in forearm pronation torque.Elliott et al was the first to report greater wrist flexion, ulnar deviation, and angular velocity when releasing a curveball, which allows the pitcher to command the appropriate spin necessary for the ball to curve.Electromyographic data are inconsistent, as Sisto et alMixed results are also found with wrist kinetics. Fleisig et al</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">Overuse has been implicated as a risk factor for upper extremity injuries in baseball pitchers, prompting Little League Baseball to institute maximum pitch counts.One of the studies cited in support of current curveball guidelines is confounded by pitch counts, which increases the odds of arm pain in a game and season.A retrospective review of pitchers who underwent ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction supporting USA Baseball&#8217;s recommendation did not compare with a healthy age-matched control group to determine statistical significance.Consistent kinematic differences were increased horizontal adduction of the shoulder, increased forearm supination, and decreased wrist extension. Kinetics were not increased at the shoulder or elbow.While the curveball does not appear to put additional biomechanical strain on a pitcher&#8217;s arm, electromyographic and kinematic studies consistently found that the curveball requires greater supination of the forearm.</chapter><chapter title="Conclusion">Despite much debate in the baseball community about the safety of the curveball, biomechanical and most epidemiologic studies do not demonstrate an increased risk of pain and/or injury when compared with the fastball. Current recommendations to discourage throwing curveballs at a young age, while well intentioned, are based on observational data and expert opinion that have not been validated by biomechanical studies. However, there is limited biomechanical and electromyographic evidence suggesting that youth pitchers throwing curveballs may benefit from conditioning programs focused on forearm supination.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4272689"><title>Cell Therapy in Joint Disorders</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Sports Health</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Peter D.</first-name><last-name>Counsel</last-name></author><author><first-name>Daniel</first-name><last-name>Bates</last-name></author><author><first-name>Richard</first-name><last-name>Boyd</last-name></author><author><first-name>David A.</first-name><last-name>Connell</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Focus Topic: Controversies in Sports Medicine</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Methods">A search was conducted through PubMed using various combinations of the terms Three randomized trials,</chapter><chapter title="Non-Cell-Based Treatment of Chondral Injury">Non-cell-based surgical treatment includes debridement, marrow stimulation by microfracture, abrasion or drilling of the subchondral bone plate, and osteochondral grafting (mosaicplasty).Abnormal cartilage in defects produces detrimental effects on adjacent and opposing cartilage, and debridement can improve symptoms and potentially minimize further chondral loss.</chapter><chapter title="Cell-Based Therapy">The first report describing ACI in humans was by Brittberg et alAutologous chondrocyte implantation utilizes cultured, mature, autologous chondrocytes suspended in an injectable medium with newer variants using a collagen type I/III membrane (ACI-C, CACI, second generation) rather than periosteal cover (ACI-P, first generation).Characterized chondrocyte implantation (CCI) maximizes chondrogenic capacity through a controlled ex vivo process that produces clinically significant improvement with up to 4 years follow-up.These procedures can result in improved clinical, arthroscopic, and histologic features, with hyaline-like cartilage or fibrocartilage present in 43.9% of ACI-C and 36.4% of MACI grafts in 1 prospective, randomized study by Bartlett et al.In a systematic review of cell-based therapy for chondral lesions from 1994 to 2009, Nakamura et alBasad et alThe chondral defect site as well as level of sports activity and physical training may influence outcome.</chapter><chapter title="Stem Cell Therapy">The stem cells with the greatest capacity for differentiation are embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In addition to ethical concerns, questions of safety have arisen because of the risk of teratoma formation.Mesenchymal stem cells are multipotential cells originally isolated from bone marrow but naturally existing in many tissues, often around blood vessels. They are defined by the expression of various cell surface molecules (eg, CD73, CD90, CD105), the capacity for self-renewal, and the ability to differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic, or adipogenic lineages.Mesenchymal stem cells are being isolated from an increasingly wider variety of human tissues, including bone marrow,The cytokine-based immunosuppressive properties of MSCs potentially induce immune tolerance, prompting investigation in multiple sclerosis, foreign graft rejection, and rheumatoid arthritis.So far, in the musculoskeletal system, MSCs derived from autologous bone marrow, subcutaneous adipose tissue, infrapatellar fat, and peripheral blood have been utilized in humans in treating osteochondral injury, OA, and rheumatoid arthritis.Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and bone marrow&#8211;MSCs (BM-MSCs) represent different cells lines, with only BM-MSCs used for chondral regeneration. HSCs renew blood elements while MSCs can differentiate into mesenchymal elements, including cartilage.Technique-related differences in aspirate yields include site (anterior vs posterior iliac crest) and syringe size.Outcome for femoral head osteonecrosis and tibial nonunion is proportionate to the number of transplanted progenitor cells.An apparent disadvantage of BM-MSCs is that cell numbers diminish with age and exhibit reduced proliferative capacity and increased rates of apoptosis compared with BM-MSC from younger patients.Mesenchymal stem cells in adipose tissue arise from or form perivascular cells.As with bone marrow, adipose stem cells may be utilized in 2 major forms. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) is a heterogeneous population of cells that may contain MSCs, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, leukocytes (lymphocytes and macrophages), and pericytes.An advantage of SVF and BMC is elimination of the time lag between harvest and implantation, minimizing exposure to risks, reducing cost and logistical difficulties.Intra-articular SVF has been successfully utilized in dogs with elbow or hip OA but with suboptimal results in horses.Improved cartilage repair was seen with culture-expanded ADSCs compared with controls in rabbit full-thickness chondral defects with better integration and more hyaline cartilage formation, but their use in humans has not been reported.Infrapatellar fat differs in composition to subcutaneous adipose tissue, containing a large amount of collagenous tissue and possibly synoviocytes.Infrapatellar SVF (not culture-expanded) has shown similar clinical findings in humans at 1 year compared with MSC free controls undergoing arthroscopic debridement, implying a potential benefit from MSC because of poorer preoperative clinical scores and ICRS grades.Peripheral blood presents another source of MSCs, obtained with relative ease and no significant donor site morbidity.Following an initial pilot report,Other stem cell sources trialed in animals, but not humans, include periosteum, synovium, and skeletal muscle.</chapter><chapter title="Methods of Stem Cell Transplantation">Surgical implantation may be similar to ACI, with MSCs beneath a periostealWakitani et alWakitani et alGobbi et alSkowro&#324;ski and RutkaRegarding open foot and ankle chondral defect repairs, implantation of nonexpanded BMC-impregnated collagen matrix was reported by Richter and ZechGiannini et alFew studies directly compare stem cell treatment to ACI. Adachi et alAutologous, cultured BM-MSCs were compared with matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation in sheep, both suspended in collagen gel, with superior results for BM-MSCs at 1 year, particularly regarding integration with adjacent native cartilage.Arthroscopic, nonexpanded BMC implantation was retrospectively compared with open field and arthroscopic ACI.Nejadnik et alIntra-articular injection holds several potential advantages, including reduced recovery time and less cost.In animal studies involving surgically created injuries to anterior cruciate ligaments, menisci, and articular cartilage, intra-articularly administered labeled BM-MSCs migrated to sites of injury.The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of MSCs may retard the progression of OA. Intra-articular injections of stem cells slowed progression of surgically induced OA in goats following a single intra-articular dose of cultured BM-MSCs,Studies of animals with spontaneous OA, as well as experimental OA, have also reported improvement following MSC injection.Orozco et alMesenchymal stem cell injection has been utilized as an adjunct to surgical techniques in humansThe location of the infrapatellar fat pad makes it an attractive harvest target.

MSCs, derived from bone marrow, can differentiate into cells of chondrogenic lineage.Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are 2 other stem cell types that can differentiate into multiple lineages of cell/tissue types, including chondrogenic cells. However, among all potential allogeneic stem cell sources, MSCs seem to hold the most promise at present.A cartilage product may be defined as a tissue, non-tissue biologic, device, drug, or a combination of these terms as per Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act.Products such as Orthokine, an autologous PRP procedure (Orthogen, D&#252;sseldorf, Germany; known as Regenokine in the United States) or ex vivo expanded autologous/allogeneic MSCs would be regulated as biological drugs by the FDA but may be regulated differently depending on the country and regulatory jurisdiction.The most important hallmark of MSCs, regardless of their tissue sources of origin, is that the MSCs do not express major histocompatibility complex class II antigens (human leukocyte antigen, DR receptors), thereby not provoking the host&#8217;s T-cell response on implantation.One of the attractive features of MSCs is the ability to readily harvest from the patient&#8217;s own tissue source such as bone marrow, although the quantity and quality of MSCs decrease with age.The optimal source of MSCs has yet to be determined.At the present time, administration usually involves placing the MSCs via intra-articular injection. The ideal approach remains to be determined as the intra-articular microenvironment can be influenced by local pro- and anti-inflammatory actions from the cells. Alternatively, MSCs can be implanted in a scaffold, encapsulated, or injected in combination with other factors such as transforming growth factor-&#946;.A systematic review of the safety of intra-articular autologous bone marrow MSC injections in humans found 22 adverse events and 4 serious adverse events following 844 procedures (mean follow-up, 21 months).The recent identification of subtypes of MSCs that may demonstrate pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory responses based on activation of toll-like receptors 4 and 3, respectively,</chapter><chapter title="Summary of Animal Models Using Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Treatment of Osteoarthritis">A full summary of animal models using MSCs to treat OA is provided in Appendix 1 (available at Diekman et alA hemimeniscectomy model in 12-week-old rats was used to evaluate single, intra-articular injections of rat- (rMSCs) and human-derived MSCs (hMSCs).In a second study, hMSCs were injected into 7-month-old guinea pigs with spontaneous knee arthritis that occurs naturally as early as 3 months of age.The potential benefits of MSCs in the treatment of OA were shown using a model of induced subchondral defects in the knees of adult white New Zealand rabbits.Adipose-derived stem cells injected into the medial compartment of rabbit anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)&#8211;transected knees showed improved radiologic and histologic scores compared with controls.Goat knees injected with MSCs 6 weeks after complete excision of the medial meniscus and resection of the ACL demonstrated marked regeneration of the medial meniscus and less cartilage damage when compared with control knees.Sheep knees were injected 6 weeks post&#8211;ACL transection with either a control (basal media without cells), chondrogenic media&#8211;induced bone marrow MSCs, or basal media&#8211;induced bone marrow MSCs.Intra-articular injections 14 days after surgery of an adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction and bone marrow&#8211;derived MSCs were compared with controls for the treatment of knee OA induced arthroscopically in horses (placebo, adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction, and bone marrow&#8211;derived MSCs).In summary, most animal studies are based on histologic evidence rather than functional evaluation, making preclinical work difficult to translate to symptomatic OA patients. Results may vary with severity of the model/injury, timing, type of MSCs, culture method, or dose.</chapter><chapter title="Clinical Studies in Humans Using Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Treatment of Osteoarthritis">A full summary of clinical studies using MSCs in the treatment of OA in humans is provided in Appendix 2 (available at Bone marrow&#8211;derived MSCs were evaluated in 6 female patients with radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of Kellgren-Lawrence grade IV knee OA.A pilot study in 4 patients with moderate to severe knee OA who received bone marrow&#8211;MSC injections and were followed for 6 months were found to have improvements in walking time for onset of pain, stair climbing, knee crepitus, and swelling.Emadedin et alPain scores improved following the injection of infrapatellar fat pad derived&#8211;MSCs into knees following arthroscopic procedures.Eighty to 90 mL of bone marrow was extracted from the iliac bone in an ambulatory setting from 12 patients with knee OA using local anesthesia and slight sedation.CARTISTEM (MEDIPOST, Seoul, Korea) is the only commercially available MSC product for OA using allogeneic, umbilical cord blood as the cell source. CARTISTEM is approved in Korea and is undergoing US FDA investigational new drug cleared phase I/IIa clinical trials in the United States for the treatment of cartilage defects in combination with an HA scaffold.</chapter><chapter title="Further Areas of Investigation">Despite recent advancements, the use of MSCs for the treatment of OA needs to be better defined. Barry and Murphy</chapter><chapter title="Conclusion">Mesenchymal stem cells are an exciting and relatively novel treatment for osteoarthritis. MSCs may improve symptoms and function in osteoarthritic joints but also decrease inflammation and induce cartilage healing. This is likely related to the secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors from MSCs.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4272691"><title>Life Span Exercise Among Elite Intercollegiate Student Athletes</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Sports Health</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Shawn C.</first-name><last-name>Sorenson</last-name></author><author><first-name>Russell</first-name><last-name>Romano</last-name></author><author><first-name>Stanley P.</first-name><last-name>Azen</last-name></author><author><first-name>E.

Current and former varsity student athletes and nonathletes completed anonymous questionnaires documenting lifetime physical, mental, and emotional health; HRQoL; and exercise behaviors and attitudes. Each participant provided informed consent, and the experimental protocol was approved by the University of Southern California Health Sciences Institutional Review Board.Participants included a convenience sample of student athletes and nonathletes. Student athletes must have practiced or competed in Division I intercollegiate athletics at the University of Southern California. Nonathletes were current and former undergraduate University of Southern California students who never practiced or competed in Division I intercollegiate athletics or organized club sports at any university.Study participants were recruited using athletic department and university records, student and alumni organizations, and personal referrals. The study population was selected to provide a representative cross-section of the University of Southern California student athlete source populationParticipants anonymously completed the TLC survey (see Appendix 1, available at Previous week&#8217;s exercise was compared with guidelines for healthy adults published by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM).Current student athletes represented all 20 varsity sports and approximately 74% of the student athlete population. This sample was considered representative of the overall source population. The survey response rate among alumni recruited for the study was 79%, including 76% of student athletes and 82% of nonathletes. Responders and nonresponders were similar in sex, age, intercollegiate sports participation, and survey type (ie, paper vs electronic).Descriptive statistics (mean [standard deviation] or number [percentage]) were calculated to compare demographic characteristics of student athletes and nonathletes. Primary independent variables included intercollegiate athletic participation (ie, student athlete vs nonathlete) and age. Participants were classified into age groups as follows: current students, younger alumni, and older alumni. Younger and older alumni were stratified based on the median age (43 years) of alumni participants.Primary dependent variables included total exercise volume, exercise importance, and rate of compliance with ACSM healthy exercise guidelines.Our secondary interest was the association between cardiopulmonary domain summary scores and ACSM exercise guideline compliance. The summary score reflected a study participant&#8217;s cumulative lifetime experience with cardiopulmonary health concerns, with a score of 0 indicating &#8220;perfect&#8221; health and higher scores indicating greater evidence of concerns.All data were screened for integrity, including identification of spurious and outlier values.For the primary analysis, stratified assessment of age and athletic participation effects on exercise volume and exercise importance was conducted using independent-samples In the secondary analysis, relative odds of ACSM exercise guideline compliance were evaluated using unconditional logistic regression (odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals) stratified across the primary independent variables. The Tarone test of homogeneity was used to assess the validity of Mantel-Haenszel common odds ratios across strata. Common odds are reported where the Tarone test indicated homogeneity (Finally, we conducted an age-stratified analysis of cardiopulmonary health, with ACSM exercise guideline compliance as an independent factor. Independent-samples Sex, ethnicity, height, body mass, and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated as potential analysis covariates. Sex and ethnicity were excluded because of small sample size (n &lt; 10) in selected combinations of the independent variables. Following assessment of confounding criteria,Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 16 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Illinois), Intercooled STATA version 10 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas), and Hopkins&#8217; spreadsheet for magnitude-based inferences.</chapter><chapter title="Results">Age and sex distributions were similar between the student athlete alumni source and study populations. There was a statistically significant difference in sport distribution between the alumni source and study populations (see Appendix 2, available at Student athletes (SAs) were similar to nonathletes (NAs) in age and sex distribution (On average, current SAs reported more than 15 hours of exercise (Appendix 3 [available at In contrast, no appreciable differences in exercise behavior or perceptions were found between alumni SAs and NAs, with comparable weekly exercise volumes between groups, small effect sizes, and little evidence of clinically relevant differences (see Appendices 3 and 4, available at Collapsed across intercollegiate athletic participation groups, alumni demonstrated differences in cardiopulmonary health associated with exercise behavior (</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">In this cross-sectional epidemiological study, current NCAA Division I intercollegiate student athletes reported substantially higher clinically relevant volumes of weekly exercise, perceived exercise importance, and likelihood of compliance with ACSM healthy exercise guidelines compared to an age- and sex-matched nonathlete control group of university students. However, no significant differences were found between alumni student athletes and nonathletes, suggesting that former student athletes fail to maintain elevated levels of exercise across their life spans compared with their nonathlete peers. Compliance with ACSM exercise guidelines was associated with a significant attenuation of age-dependent cardiopulmonary health concerns independent of intercollegiate athletic participation.As anticipated, the currently competitive elite athletes in our study exemplified high exercise levels and a strong self-rated value of exercise. Student athletes were more than 30 times as likely to meet ACSM healthy exercise guidelines, reported exercise volume nearly 4 times that of nonathlete controls, and 77% described exercise as &#8220;very important&#8221; in their lives (versus just 16% of nonathletes). Student athlete alumni demonstrated striking reductions in exercise volume and guideline compliance compared with current student athletes. Meanwhile, nonathletes had similar exercise behavior across their life spans. Accordingly, younger and older alumni demonstrated similar exercise behavior and perceptions irrespective of intercollegiate athletic participation.Our findings contrast with previous investigations conducted in the 1980s and 1990s showing higher levels of life span exercise among elite athletes compared with referent groups.Sex differences in the study populations may also contribute to discrepancies. Several studiesAlumni in our study reported lower rates of compliance with ACSM exercise guidelines (38%) compared with US adults in general (49%).Beyond retirement from competitive sports, lifestyle and exercise behavior play important roles in long-term health. For instance, trained distance runners who continue high-intensity training maintain higher aerobic capacity (VValid and reliable measurement of exercise behavior is notoriously difficult and the subject of ongoing discussions in the literature.This study has several strengths. Our study employed a survey instrument that has undergone rigorous validation of its psychometric propertiesIn summary, current NCAA Division I student athletes demonstrated significant, clinically meaningful differences in exercise behavior and perceptions compared with nonathlete students, whereas alumni student athletes and nonathletes demonstrated similar involvement and interest.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4272692"><title>Ability of Preseason Body Composition and Physical Fitness to Predict the Risk of Injury in Male Collegiate Hockey Players</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Sports Health</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>John A.</first-name><last-name>Grant</last-name></author><author><first-name>Asheesh</first-name><last-name>Bedi</last-name></author><author><first-name>Jennifer</first-name><last-name>Kurz</last-name></author><author><first-name>Richard</first-name><last-name>Bancroft</last-name></author><author><first-name>Joel J.</first-name><last-name>Gagnier</last-name></author><author><first-name>Bruce S.</first-name><last-name>Miller</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Focus Topic: Controversies in Sports Medicine</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Materials and Methods">All male ice hockey athletes from a single Division I university varsity team over 8 successive hockey seasons were included in this study. These athletes were identified from rosters and SIMS (Sports Injury Monitoring System V5.2; Flantech, Inc) database entries maintained by the team&#8217;s head athletic trainer. Athletes were excluded if they did not participate in the preseason fitness assessments. Athletes were included as cases if they had a diagnosis of a hockey-related injury during the collegiate hockey season, including the preseason and postseason. All injuries were assessed by the team&#8217;s head athletic trainer in consultation with the team physician as necessary. Athletes were excluded if they were injured during non-hockey-related activity or during off-ice hockey activity. An injury was defined as any event that directly resulted in the athlete being unable to participate in on-ice activity for at least 1 day following the event.Individual tracking of athlete participation at each session allowed for a direct calculation of athlete exposure.The following athlete demographic and injury variables were collected: (1) age, (2) year of eligibility, (3) mechanism of injury, (4) player position (forward, defense, goaltender), (5) whether injury occurred during a game (including period) or practice session, and (6) time lost before return to play.The mechanism of injury was categorized has having occurred by impact with another player, impact with the puck/stick, impact with the ice/boards/goal, a noncontact acute injury, or an overuse injury. The type of injury was categorized as fracture/dislocation, sprain, strain, laceration, contusion, concussion/closed head injury, or bursitis/synovitis. The body part injured was categorized as follows: leg/foot, knee, hip/thigh, arm/hand, shoulder, thorax, or head/neck.Body composition, aerobic endurance, and strength assessment data had been routinely collected on all varsity hockey athletes over the 8 seasons. These data were collected by the same strength and conditioning coach during standardized testing of all players during training camp each year. Some of the specific fitness variables assessed were exchanged after the first 4 years of the study period. As such, all variables were not available for all years. Three separate sets of data were therefore available for analysis (Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 6.0 (Stata Corp). Athlete demographic, injury, and fitness data were described with measures of central tendency, variance, and boxplots. The difference in the frequency of injury by player position was assessed with a chi-square analysis. Single-variable logistic regression analyses were employed to assess the ability of each independent variable to predict the probability of the occurrence of an on-ice injury (While data from the same player over multiple seasons are not mutually exclusive, the modifiable risk factors that may have confounded injury risk year to year would be included in the analysis, and therefore controlled for. Also, an individual&#8217;s anthropometric, cardiovascular, body composition, and strength variables may have changed from year to year, potentially modifying their risk for injury. In this manner, the independent variables associated with specific individuals could be paired with their injury history for the same year. To account for multiple observations for individual players across several years, the variables &#8220;player,&#8221; &#8220;year,&#8221; and the interaction term &#8220;player &#215; year&#8221; were modeled on the probability of injury using logistic regression. This modeling of both the &#8220;player&#8221; and &#8220;year&#8221; variables account for the clustering associated with multiple years and having the same player present in multiple years.</chapter><chapter title="Results">Seventy-nine different players participated on the team over the 8 seasons (Forwards sustained a significantly higher proportion of injuries (68.2%, &#967;The various mechanisms of injury, the frequency of injury by body region, and the types of injuries sustained are shown in Four variables were identified as significant predictors of the odds of on-ice injury in the 8-year data set (model 1, Appendix 2; available at The analysis of the 4-year data in model 2 demonstrated that only the maximal number of sit-ups was a significant predictor of on-ice injury. The odds of injury increased 1.3 times for each increase of 5 sit-ups (</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">The injury rate of 4.4 injuries per 1000 AEs is consistent with the rates found by 2 previous studies of US collegiate hockey (2.69/1000 AEs and 6.4/1000 AEs)Fatigue has been suggested as a possible factor related to injuries in ice hockey. Three studies show that more injuries occur in the third period than either of the first 2 periods.An increase in body weight and BMI were related to an increased likelihood of injury. Superficially, those players who weighed more and potentially had an increase in body fat were less fit and were therefore more likely to be injured. Body composition, however, was an independently assessed variable and was not a significant predictor of injury. It is therefore difficult to fully explain the relationship between body weight or BMI and injury. Given the relative increase in lean muscle mass in athletes compared with the general population, it is important to note that BMI in this athletic population is regarded as a general measure of the body mass to height ratio and not specifically a measure of body composition or body fat percentage.The fact that better scores in the tests of physical fitness (ie, bench press, sit-ups, Olympic cleans, shuttle run) were related to an increased odds of injury further clouds the result. While the relationship between groin strains and adductor muscle strength and hip adductor to abductor muscle imbalance varies among studies,The findings of this study present 2 possible explanations: (1) preseason fitness levels are not strongly predictive of on-ice injury or (2) the general fitness measures included in this study are not sufficiently specific to hockey to strongly predict those players who have an increased likelihood of on-ice injury.As with any retrospective study, there are limitations. There were 203 player-years and 19 variables assessed in the logistic regression analyses. While this sample size is within the 10 samples per variable rule of thumb,</chapter><chapter title="Conclusion">Division I male collegiate ice hockey teams can expect approximately 17 lost-time injuries per season, with a median of 2 practices or games missed per injury.

Players with higher body weight and BMI are more likely to be injured.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4272693"><title>A Double-Blinded Placebo Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating Short-term Efficacy of Platelet-Rich Plasma in Reducing Postoperative Pain After Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Sports Health</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Alisha</first-name><last-name>Hak</last-name></author><author><first-name>Krishan</first-name><last-name>Rajaratnam</last-name></author><author><first-name>Olufemi R.</first-name><last-name>Ayeni</last-name></author><author><first-name>Jaydeep</first-name><last-name>Moro</last-name></author><author><first-name>Devin</first-name><last-name>Peterson</last-name></author><author><first-name>Sheila</first-name><last-name>Sprague</last-name></author><author><first-name>Mohit</first-name><last-name>Bhandari</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Current Research</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Methods">We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial comparing PRP and normal saline (placebo) in patients undergoing arthroscopic RC repair. In this study, &#8220;double-blind&#8221; includes study patients and data analyzers, including the Central Adjudication Committee (CAC). Prior to the initiation of this study, approval (REB #10-403) was obtained from the McMaster University / Hamilton Health Sciences Research Ethics Board. Two surgeons (K.R. and O.A.) at 2 clinical centres within Hamilton Health Sciences (McMaster University Medical Center and Hamilton General Site) participated in this study. Briefly, patients with RC tears who provided informed consent were randomized to receive either PRP or normal saline during their arthroscopic RC repair surgery and at 4 weeks after their arthroscopy procedure. Patients completed demographic and baseline questionnaires prior to their surgery. Patients were assessed at 2, 4, and 6 weeks postoperatively (All patients scheduled for arthroscopic RC repair surgery with the participating surgeons during the recruitment period, from October 2010 to July 2012, were screened for eligibility. Reasons for ineligibility were documented. Patients were enrolled in the study if they met the criteria outlined in Eligible patients providing informed consent were randomized prior to surgery using an Internet-based randomization system to ensure concealment of patient allocation. Random variable block sizes were used to avoid an imbalance in the number of patients assigned to each treatment group. Patients were randomized to have their RC tear repairs augmented with either PRP or normal saline (placebo), receiving injections intraoperatively and again at 4 weeks postoperatively.All operations were performed under general anesthesia, with patients positioned in the beach chair position. Surgery commenced with a diagnostic arthroscopy of the glenohumeral joint. The cuff tear size was evaluated using a calibrated probe. A full subacromial bursectomy was performed. An acromioplasty was performed with release of the coracoacromial ligament and bony overhang of the acromion. The greater tuberosity was then further prepared. Next, a small awl was hand-tapped to make the pilot hole in the greater tuberosity for an Arthrex 5.5-mm BioCorkscrew suture anchor insertion. The anchor was then inserted in the mid-greater tuberosity footprint area. Each anchor was double loaded with number 2 Fibrewire sutures. One anchor was inserted for each centimeter of the supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus tear that required repair. The repair incorporated any delaminated areas. A single row repair was performed.PRP was prepared using the Arthrex Autologous Conditioned Plasma (ACP) Double Syringe System (Arthrex, Inc). This system allows for rapid and efficient concentration of platelets and growth factors from autologous blood for use at the treatment site.The surgeon performed the intraoperative injection of either the prepared PRP or normal saline under direct visualization. Patients randomized to the normal saline group received a normal saline injection (6-9 mL). For patients randomized to the PRP group, half of the PRP volume (6-9 mL total volume) was injected directly into the RC tendon under direct visualization in several positions along the repair site (articular side). The injecting needle was then placed in the subacromial space, and all instrumentation was removed before performing the skin closure. After the skin closure, the subacromial space was suctioned of residual fluid, and the remaining PRP (3-4.5 mL) was injected into the subacromial space.At the 4-week visit, under ultrasound guidance, the second PRP or normal saline injection (depending on randomization) was administered by the attending surgeon, trained to use a SonoSite Ultrasound (Bothwell). Blood draw was performed using an 18- to 20-gauge needle for all patients to maintain blinding. A 3-mL lidocaine skin injection was first administered to raise a skin wheal. Using a 22- to 25-gauge needle, 1 to 2 mL of the randomized product was injected at the supraspinatus tendon&#8211;bone interface, and the rest was injected on top of the supraspinatus tissue in the subacromial space (2-3 mL).Patients were all discharged home on the day of surgery. The use of an ice pack was recommended, and Percocet was permitted for the first 48 hours postoperatively. All other postoperative pain management methods were avoided, including regional nerve blocks, pain pumps, and injections of any pain medication. Standard physiotherapy guidelines were followed.Patients were assessed in the perioperative period by their attending surgeon at 2, 4, and 6 weeks postsurgery. The patients completed the VAS for pain and quality of life and functional questionnaires at each of these clinic visits. They were also asked about adverse events and reoperations, and this information was verified by their surgeon and by a review of their medical records.The primary outcome was change in pain severity, measured using a VAS at 6 weeks postsurgery. Patients were asked to rate their worst pain in their shoulder for the previous 24 hours on a 10-cm vertical scale, with &#8220;0&#8221; indicating no pain at all and &#8220;10&#8221; indicating the worst pain the patient could imagine. The VAS is considered to be a sensitive measure that is able to detect small changes in an individual&#8217;s perception of pain severity.Secondary outcome measures include the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC), and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Score (DASH) administered prior to the surgical intervention and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks postsurgery, as well as incidence of revision surgeries and adverse events.Briefly, the EQ-5D is a comprehensive, compact health status classification and health state preference system.The WORC is a self-administered, 21-item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains, including pain and physical symptoms, sports and recreation, work function, social function, and emotional function. This instrument is a valid, reliable, and responsive measure of outcome specific to RC injuries.The DASH is a 30-item, self-reported questionnaire designed to measure physical function and symptoms in patients with musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. In addition to its wide use in evaluating function in orthopaedic patients, the DASH has been extensively validated and is a reliable and responsive measure.Any adverse events and complications deemed related to the affected shoulder by the reporting surgeon were documented. Revision surgeries were defined as any secondary operative procedures at the affected shoulder site. Planned secondary interventions from initial surgical procedures were not considered outcome events.The blinded CAC reviewed all reoperations and adverse events to see if they were related to the injected product and to be considered an outcome event. After independent assessment, consensus was reached for each decision.Statistical analyses were completed using SPSS for Windows 20.0.</chapter><chapter title="Results">Seventy-seven patients were screened from October 2010 to July 2012. Of these, 52 were excluded and 25 patients met the study inclusion criteria and agreed to participate. The 25 patients were randomized to PRP (12 patients) and normal saline (13 patients) groups. All patients received the treatment they were randomized to. At the time of the interim analysis, 24 patients were followed until 6 weeks (12 PRP, 12 saline); 1 patient was lost to follow-up after the 4-week visit (The mean age of the study participants was 55 &#177; 6.4 years, and that patient age range was similar across the treatment groups (The mean difference between the groups was not statistically significant (Analysis of the treatment effect for standardized mean difference between baseline and week 6 between the 2 groups (1.81 points on the VAS scale) suggested that 150 patients would be required to achieve adequate study power. Analysis of the treatment effect for difference in mean at 6 weeks (0.3 points on the VAS scale) suggested that approximately 2400 more patients would be required to achieve adequate study power for this difference. Given the sample size requirements to find a difference in standardized mean difference between baseline and week 6 between the 2 groups, the trial was stopped early as initial enrollment plans would not approach adequate power.The EQ-5D scores decreased in both groups from baseline to 2 weeks, showed improvement at week 4, and decreased again at week 6 (In the PRP group, the WORC scores increased consistently from baseline to week 6. In the saline group, scores decreased from baseline to week 2, increased at week 4, and decreased at week 6 (In both treatment groups, the DASH scores were worse from baseline to week 2 and showed improvement at weeks 4 and 6 (The CAC reviewed 4 adverse events: 1 case in the saline group of excessive pain, and 3 cases in the PRP group&#8212;infection at the site of injection, hand swelling from an intravenous line, and nausea and dizziness immediately postoperative. Of these, the infection in the PRP group was classified as a superficial surgical site infection and determined to be a study event. No revision surgeries occurred in either group during the 6-week follow-up period. Given the sample size, no conclusion can be made regarding differences in adverse event frequency between the 2 groups.</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">At interim analysis, our study overall did not show a significant change in the standardized mean difference in VAS scores between the 2 groups at baseline and 6 weeks. In addition, our interim analysis demonstrated a lack of clinically important benefit to PRP after arthroscopic RC repair using quality of life measures at 6 weeks. Given the sample size requirements to find a difference in the standardized mean difference between the groups at the designated time points, the trial was stopped early as the initial enrollment plans would not approach adequate power. While the study could not demonstrate that the injected product influenced the pain score, the overall decrease in pain from baseline for both groups demonstrates that arthroscopic surgery to repair RC tears does provide pain relief. Five patients were confirmed by the blinded CAC to have RC tears larger than 3.0 cm, and 4 of them had pain scores documented at 6 weeks; their eventual removal from the dataset did not change the primary outcome.Secondary objectives assessing function and quality of life exhibit varying patterns. The EQ-5D scores increased and decreased in both groups at each follow-up visit, and it is not clear whether there was overall improvement or not, failing to demonstrate any statistically significant findings. Of interest, the PRP group showed slightly improved scores from baseline to 6 weeks, whereas the saline group showed slightly worsened scores. The WORC scores improved in both groups at week 6 compared with baseline, demonstrating improvement in functioning after surgical repair without any specific benefit for augmentation with PRP. The DASH scores were also relatively similar between groups, worsening immediately after surgery and improving at weeks 4 and 6. The scores at 6 weeks were very similar between the 2 groups and better in the saline group; however, the PRP group showed improvement at week 6 compared with baseline, whereas the saline group&#8217;s mean score at week 6 was worsened from baseline.No revision surgeries occurred over the 6-week follow-up period; however, there were 4 adverse events. Three of these occurred in the PRP group and 1 in the saline group. The CAC determined that the infection occurring at the site of surgery after the patient&#8217;s week 4 follow-up was to be considered a study event. No other adverse events were deemed to be study-related. Because of the small sample size, no conclusion can be made regarding differences in adverse event frequency between the 2 groups.While the present study did demonstrate some slight trends in pain reduction in the PRP group, these overall findings are consistent with the mounting literature examining the use of PRP to augment arthroscopic RC repair surgeries. A randomized controlled trial by Castricini et alIn summary, 2 of the 3 previously conducted studies that involved a control did not report any benefit to the application of PRP intraoperatively; however, each study reported on different outcome measures, and at different time points, rendering a comparison difficult. Randelli et alThere are several strengths in the present study. First, the patients were all randomized and blinded to their treatment groups. All study events were independently assessed by a blinded CAC. Quality of life and pain scores were collected at frequent time points postoperatively, allowing for an increased likelihood that subtle changes may be noticed; as pain is often at its highest immediately postoperatively, this is beneficial. Furthermore, the follow-up was 96% at 6 weeks.An apparent limitation of this pilot study was the short follow-up period. Although data on pain, the primary outcome measure used for assessing the effect of PRP, were intended to be analyzed shortly after surgery, 6 weeks is an insufficient time period to capture all potential RC re-tears and revision surgeries. Another limitation of the study was the inability to screen for RC tear size before recruitment, which led to 5 patients being included with tear sizes above the 3-cm limit for inclusion. In addition, our results are primarily applicable to patients with traumatic and degenerative RC tears that are repaired initially within 18 months of diagnosis. Patients with preexisting conditions associated with upper extremity pain or systemic disorders may not have outcomes similar to those included in the present study.</chapter><chapter title="Conclusion">The present study demonstrated no conclusive benefit for reducing postoperative pain after augmenting arthroscopically repaired RC tears with PRP compared with saline at 6 weeks; therefore, the primary hypothesis is rejected. It failed to demonstrate that patients receiving PRP injections intraoperatively and at 4 weeks postoperatively have decreased pain and superior functional outcomes than those receiving normal saline. Identifying therapies that improve outcomes in patients with RC tears remains a challenge and deserves ongoing investigation.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4272694"><title>Shoulder Arthroplasty</title><article-type>review-article</article-type><journal-title>Sports Health</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>M.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Physiotherapy Associates, Exton, PA. Twenty subjects (13 men, 7 women) between 18 and 50 years of age and no history of shoulder or spinal injury in the past year prior to data collection volunteered to participate in this investigation. Subjects were free from any history of shoulder or spinal surgery. Subjects were active in recreational sports and demonstrated competence in the performance of the exercises, including catching and throwing ability.A Noraxon Myotrace Model 1400A (Noraxon) electromyography (EMG) unit was used to measure muscular activity on the subjects&#8217; dominant upper extremity using standardized surface electrode application and technique (infraspinatus, upper trapezius, lower trapezius, serratus anterior, middle deltoid, and posterior deltoid). The application of surface electrodes followed standardized methodology.Precise locations of each surface electrode followed previous guidelines.The average and peak muscle activity was recorded for each exercise and was normalized to the maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of each muscle tested. The muscular activity classification used in this study included 0% to 15% as absent to minimal, 16% to 30% as low, 31% to 60% as moderate, and greater than 60% as high.The order of testing for the 2 exercises was randomized as was the load (Thera-Band Soft Weight; Hygenic Corporation): 0.5 kg and 1 kg for each subject. The MVIC and exercise data were collected in the same testing session. Electrodes were applied once and not moved between the MVIC and exercise data sampling. Subjects were allowed 5 minutes of rest between MVIC testing and performance of the exercise conditions and 2 minutes of rest between exercise conditions. Prior to application of the electrodes, subjects who were unfamiliar with the exercises were allowed time to practice with the metronome to ensure proper form, speed, and consistent performance during data collection.The subjects were positioned prone on a standard treatment table with 90&#176; of external rotation and 90&#176; of glenohumeral joint abduction in the coronal plane (90/90 position). A 0.5-kg (tan) and a 1-kg (yellow) Thera-Band Soft Weight were used to alternately catch and drop during a 10-second interval while muscular activity was sampled from the targeted muscles (Subjects were tested in an upright position with their dominant side (ipsilateral) knee flexed onto a foam pad and contralateral lower extremity in 90&#176; of hip and knee flexion directly in front of them for stabilization (SPSS (SPSS Inc) was used to generate the descriptive statistics from a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that had transferred the peak and average normalized muscular activity data from the sampling windows from the Noraxon EMG software.</chapter><chapter title="Results">The muscular activity results are presented in </chapter><chapter title="Discussion">The 2 plyometric exercises resulted in moderate to high levels of muscular activity of the infraspinatus and scapular stabilizing musculature (lower trapezius and serratus anterior) using relatively low loads of 0.5 and 1 kg. While direct comparisons between EMG studies outlining rotator cuff and scapular muscle activity are difficult because of methodologic differences, it is worth noting that the muscular activity levels in the infraspinatus measured during these 2 exercises are similar to percentage MVIC reported for more traditional exercises such as side-lying and prone external rotation.In a series of plyometric training investigations of upper extremity movement patterns, small increases in rotator cuff and upper extremity strength and functional improvement were encountered particularly among experienced, coordinated subjects who could optimally perform the movement patterns.Lower exercise intensities facilitate the relative activation of the rotator cuff compared with the deltoid musculature supporting the use of the lighter exercise intensities during plyometric exercises.Several limitations exist in this study that must be taken into account. With the present instrumentation and methods, analysis of the specific phases of the exercises was not possible, and the data for each exercise are meant to summarize both the average and peak muscular activity which characterizes these exercises. Additionally, there can be surface EMG cross talk between electrodes, which can compromise the measurement of activity of individual muscles. Every attempt was made to standardize electrode placement and sample carefully representative data from each of the exercise trials to capture optimal windows of muscle performance. Cross talk secondary to movement artifact during these exercises may further affect the data collection from surface electrodes during scapulothoracic and glenohumeral joint movements. Finally, as the primary purpose of this study was descriptive, neither a formal analysis was performed to determine sample size nor were repeated measures performed to evaluate the reproducibility of the standardized methodology used during this investigation.</chapter><chapter title="Conclusion">Moderate to high levels of muscular activity were measured in the rotator cuff and scapular stabilizers during the prone 90/90 external rotation and reverse catch plyometric exercises with the glenohumeral joint abducted 90&#176;.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4272696"><title>Protracted Recovery From a Concussion</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Sports Health</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Regina O.</first-name><last-name>Kostyun</last-name></author><author><first-name>Imran</first-name><last-name>Hafeez</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Focus Topic: Controversies in Sports Medicine</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Methods">A retrospective chart review design was used in this study and approved by the institutional review board. All patients were seen at an outpatient adolescent sports medicine concussion clinic, which included 2 physicians, and 1 physician assistant. Inclusion criteria were (1) initially seen between September 2010 and September 2011, (2) diagnosed with a concussion (ICD-9 code 850.9), (3) between the ages of 11 and 18 years, and (4) managed through completion of care. A large portion of our patients were treated through a community-wide comanagement program, where community pediatricians would refer patients to our clinic who were still symptomatic 3 weeks after injury.Recovery from the concussion was determined by the medical provider once the individual and their parent or guardian expressed their symptoms were back to baseline. Signs of recovery included behaving normally at home, completing full academic activities with no restrictions or limitations, demonstrating competent scores on neurocognitive tests, and clearance for unrestricted physical activity.The primary outcomes for this study were sex and the number of treatment interventions during the management of a concussion for adolescent athletes. Treatment interventions included rest, academic accommodations, and medications as well as referrals to physical therapy, vestibular therapy, neuropsychology, neurology, speech pathology, and psychology. During the rest period, patients were asked to avoid the classroom environment and to refrain from participation in academic activities at home. The interventions of rest and academic accommodations were identified by school notes.Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute). Descriptive analysis was conducted for age, sport, and treatment interventions. A single-factor analysis of variance was used to determine the differences between sex and recovery along with sex and number of prescribed treatment interventions. A univariate logistic regression with an alpha level set at 0.05 was used to determine sex and specific treatment intervention.</chapter><chapter title="Results">A total of 266 adolescent athletes, including 102 female athletes, who were treated for concussion during the 2010-2011 sports season met the inclusion criteria for this study (The most commonly prescribed treatment inventions for female and male athletes were rest (95.1% and 73.2%) and academic accommodations (72.5 and 42.1%), respectively. The average number of treatment interventions prescribed during the management of a concussion was 2.2 &#177; 1.5 for female and 1.3 &#177; 1.0 for male athletes (</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">To enhance the understanding of the complex interaction between sex and age on concussion recovery, this study aimed to investigate the frequency of treatment interventions prescribed for each sex during the management of adolescent athletes with a protracted recovery from a concussion.The results of this study extend the understanding of persistent concussion symptoms and current management strategies in several ways. First, these results support current evidence that adolescent athletes require a greater amount of time to recover from a concussion than the traditionally quoted time frame of 7 to 10 days. The results also showed that adolescent female athletes were more likely to require additional treatment interventions beyond the standard cognitive and physical rest. This emphasizes the need for an individualized management plan for an athlete recovering from a concussion.Physical and cognitive rest is the cornerstone of concussion management.Unfortunately, there is currently no standard length of rest an individual will require after a concussion. However, in most patients, there is a point where the clinical benefits of rest are outweighed by the side effects caused by the lack of activity and social interactions. At this stage, the treating provider should alter a patient&#8217;s treatment to address the current concussive symptoms while avoiding the negative side effects that may further delay recovery.When a student is absent for an extended period of time, there may be a certain level of stress and anxiety about integrating back into the classroom environment.This study showed that female athletes with concussions were 3 times more likely than male athletes to be prescribed academic accommodations for their transition back into the classroom after a period of absolute rest. Therefore, it appears that female athletes may be more likely to need the security of academic accommodations to help ease potential anxiety or stress over missed assignments and incomplete grades. Although the exact accommodations prescribed were not collected as part of this study, they commonly range from simple adaptations such as assignment deadline extensions to aggressive modifications of the academic environment such as accommodations for light and noise sensitivity. In certain situations, the use of a tutor or implementation of a temporary action strategy that addresses the student&#8217;s current cognitive disabilitiesVestibular and visual dysfunctions have been identified in concussed individualsVestibular therapy has been implemented in patients with chronic symptoms during activities of daily living after head injuries.To date, there has been no evidence to support medication usage to help correct the pathophysiologic processes that occur from trauma-induced biomechanical forces and thus shorten recovery times for a concussion.This study has several limitations, including the interpretation of clinical notes, missing charts, unrecorded information, and incomplete documentation. In addition, clinical outcomes were not used during the management of this injury to determine the effectiveness of each prescribed treatment intervention. It is possible that individually prescribed interventions did not improve the individual&#8217;s symptoms or dysfunctions and therefore additional interventions were applied to the management plan. Last, although statistically significant differences were found between sex and recovery as well as sex and treatment intervention, this study did not evaluate injury severity. It is possible that female athletes had more severe concussions than male athletes, which could explain the additional treatment interventions prescribed during the management of their injury.</chapter><chapter title="Conclusion">Adolescent athletes may be susceptible to a protracted recovery course from a concussion. Persistent symptoms and chronic cognitive dysfunctions can impact an adolescent athlete recovering from a concussion.

The procedures followed the American College of Radiology&#8217;s (ACR) MRI QC Program, which is based on the analysis of data acquired from scanning an ACR&#8211;National Electrical Manufacturers Association QC phantom. Each field center was responsible for keeping its ACCORD scanners within ACR performance specifications and for sending monthly digital images to the MRI QC center for in-house review. According to ACR phantom analyses, MRI scanner performance was stable across the MRI sites and over the duration of the study. In vivo confirmation of scanner performance over time is reflected by the stability of subject intracranial volumes (ICV) over time (baseline mean ICV, 1,132.34 cmThe MRIs were first preprocessed using previously validated and published techniques (RAVENS map intensity values quantify the regional distribution of GM, WM, and ventricular CSF, with one RAVENS map for each tissue type. In particular, RAVENS values in the template&#8217;s (stereotaxic) space are directly proportional to the volume of the respective structures in the original brain scan. Therefore, regional volumetric measurements and comparisons are performed by measurements and comparisons of the respective RAVENS maps. For example, patterns of relatively lower regional GM volume in the temporal lobe are quantified by patterns of RAVENS decrease in the temporal lobe in the template space. The RAVENS algorithm has been extensively validated and applied to a variety of studies (The RAVENS maps were normalized by individual ICV to adjust for global between-person differences in intracranial size and down-sampled to 2 &#215; 2 &#215; 2 mm. Estimates of region-specific longitudinal volumetric change were obtained from the baseline and follow-up RAVENS maps by calculating the intensity difference at each voxel between the two time points. These rates of change are denoted as dRAVENS.For the pattern analysis of the imaging data, we used the diabetes duration and HbAIn our initial statistical analysis on baseline data using the standard voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach, we identified trends for diabetes duration (e.g., regions with significance To leverage the strengths of ODVBA, which is a discriminative method, the values for diabetes duration and HbAIn the cross-sectional analysis, ODVBA was applied on baseline imaging values of GM, WM, and VN RAVENS maps. Before applying ODVBA, RAVENS maps were corrected for age, sex, and systolic blood pressure by fitting a voxel-by-voxel generalized linear model to the RAVENS values against the covariates and by calculating the residual of the regression at each voxel. ODVBA constructed a voxel-by-voxel image of significance derived from the optimized spatial adaptive filtering applied to the data, which highlights potential spatial differences in the relationship between images and subject groups. Because many statistical tests (i.e., one on each individual voxel) were being conducted, the final maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR correction. The clusters that exceeded a significance threshold of In the longitudinal analysis, ODVBA was applied on GM, WM, and VN dRAVENS maps, which capture longitudinal rate of regional change in tissue volume in a given subject&#8217;s brain at each voxel, for detecting imaging patterns of volume change associated with group differences between subjects in intensive and standard glycemic treatment arms. FDR-corrected values are reported at a significance level of For the analysis of cognition, the longitudinal rate of change of each participant in each cognitive test was estimated by linear regression using baseline, 20-month, and 40-month test scores for DSST, RAVLT, and STROOP. The subjects were then stratified into &#8220;declining&#8221; and &#8220;nondeclining&#8221; cognition categories based on the 20th and 80th percentiles, similar to what was done for diabetes duration and HbA</chapter><chapter title="Results">Regional pattern analysis using ODVBA was applied on baseline GM, WM, and VN RAVENS maps, which were corrected for age, sex, and systolic blood pressure, to identify group differences between subject categories for low and high values of diabetes duration and HbAThe baseline characteristics of participants with low and high diabetes duration are given in There was no statistically significant correlation of low versus high baseline HbAThe longitudinal analysis using ODVBA has been applied for identifying group differences in regional volume loss patterns between subjects in the intensive glycemic treatment arm and those in the standard treatment arm.

Importantly, the regions that showed longitudinal differences were mostly adjacent to regions displaying significant cross-sectional relationship with diabetes duration and tended to show just a trend at baseline.Summary statistics of cognitive decline and nondecline categories for each cognitive test are given in </chapter><chapter title="Conclusions">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use pattern analysis methods to investigate the spatial specificity of patterns of brain volume loss in relation to diabetes duration and HbAWe applied a new VBM approach, ODVBA (We found, at baseline, that participants with longer diabetes duration had significantly reduced GM volumes in a number of brain regions. The frontal and temporal lobes were particularly more vulnerable to diabetes effects. The cortical patterns of decreased GM volume showed similarities with previously reported regions in MRI studies comparing diabetic and normal participants (Previous studies also reported enlarged VNs in diabetic patients compared with healthy controls (An important finding is that intensive glycemic treatment displays relative preservation of some but not all brain regions. The finding of a differential treatment effect is consistent with previous findings (Interestingly, the areas that were associated to change in cognition were different from those affected from the treatment, which may explain the previous finding that there were no significant differences in the cognitive outcomes between the two treatment groups (An important limitation of structural MRI is the lack of molecular specificity. Thus, interpretation of the measured volume changes in GM is challenging. Neuropathological correlates of the macroscopic volumetric reduction are heterogeneous and can include not only neuronal loss but also cortical thinning, subcortical vascular pathology, WM rarefaction, or other reasons (No brain region was found to display significant correlation with low versus high HbAA limitation of this study is that the sample includes diabetic subjects only. Our findings on the relationship between diabetes duration and extent of brain volume loss are relatively conservative because they were obtained after correcting for age. Diabetes duration and age were somewhat correlated (Several factors might have contributed to the dissociation between the treatment effects on brain structure and on cognition (Launer et al.

Sixty-nine adolescents with type 1 diabetes and 13 nondiabetic control subjects had data available for analyses of cardiopulmonary fitness, insulin sensitivity, ACR, and eGFR, as determined by creatinine and cystatin C levels.Screening included a medical history, physical examination, Tanner staging, and fasting laboratory testing (measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin [HbAAll subsequent tests were performed after a 12-h fast, preceded by 3 days of restricted physical activity and a fixed-macronutrient, weight-maintenance diet (55% carbohydrates, 30% fat, 15% protein).

First, our sample size was relatively small. However, to minimize the effect of sample size, we used careful and detailed physiological measurements, including gold standard fitness testing and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies. We also chose groups similar in habitual physical activity, pubertal stage, sex, and BMI, and controlled for prestudy diet and physical activity. Another limitation to the current study included the cross-sectional design, which prevents the determination of causality, and whether the association holds true longitudinally; for that reason, the data should be viewed as hypothesis generating. The direction of the association between renal health and exercise capacity (i.e., whether renal health leads to reduced exercise capacity or vice versa) is also difficult to determine with the available data. Results from this study may also not be generalizable to older people with type 1 diabetes or to cohorts with a different ethnic distribution. Finally, we used an estimate of GFR to assess renal function; however, to estimate the GFR we used the Bouvet equation, which was shown to have the best performance in estimating GFR in children and adolescents with normal to elevated GFRs (In conclusion, in adolescents with type 1 diabetes, a disease characterized by reduced peak exercise capacity compared with nondiabetic adolescents, there was a strong relationship between eGFR and cardiopulmonary fitness, independent of directly measured insulin sensitivity and other important risk factors. This observation provides further evidence for the broad interactions observed between renal and cardiovascular function in type 1 diabetes. Further research is needed to investigate the longitudinal relationships between renal and cardiopulmonary health in adolescents with type 1 diabetes, and to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying this relationship as potential therapeutic targets.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4274776"><title>Neuronal T-Cell Autoreactivity Is Amplified in Overweight Children With New-Onset Insulin-Requiring Diabetes</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Diabetes Care</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Melissa A.</first-name><last-name>Buryk</last-name></author><author><first-name>H-Michael</first-name><last-name>Dosch</last-name></author><author><first-name>Ingrid</first-name><last-name>Libman</last-name></author><author><first-name>Vincent C.</first-name><last-name>Arena</last-name></author><author><first-name>Yihe</first-name><last-name>Huang</last-name></author><author><first-name>Roy K.</first-name><last-name>Cheung</last-name></author><author><first-name>Massimo</first-name><last-name>Trucco</last-name></author><author><first-name>Massimo</first-name><last-name>Pietropaolo</last-name></author><author><first-name>Dorothy J.</first-name><last-name>Becker</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Clinical Care/Education/Nutrition/Psychosocial Research</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Introduction">Type 1a diabetes is defined by autoimmune-mediated &#946;-cell dysfunction and destruction (The global rise of obesity is mirrored in cohorts of pediatric type 1 diabetes (Due to scarce mechanistic understanding of the immunometabolic interface in pediatric diabetes, our aim is to assess if adiposity and surrogate measures of insulin resistance impact T- and B-cell autoimmunity in normal and overweight children with insulin-requiring diabetes.

When number of T-cell reactivities were grouped into negative (&lt;4), positive (4&#8211;8), or strongly positive (9&#8211;10) responses, there were no differences between the groups, all with a median of two positive islet autoantibodies (Twenty-nine subjects were negative for conventionally assessed islet autoantibodies.

This AbZnT8 was measured in these autoantibody-negative subjects. Two of 29 subjects (7%) were positive for ZnT8. Therefore, with addition of ZnT8, 27 of 261 subjects (10%) were autoantibody negative.

Physicians identified potential participants during routine care and reviewed the study and inclusion/exclusion criteria with them. Physicians were especially encouraged to refer individuals with one or more obesity-related comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, or metabolic syndrome. A referral form was signed by both the physician and patient and faxed to the researchers. Interested participants were contacted by the research staff, phone screened for eligibility, and scheduled for an orientation session, at which time further information was provided about the study and informed consent completed. Participants were scheduled for a baseline assessment and randomization/program kickoff visit &#8764;1 week later.Participants were randomly assigned to a 3-month Internet behavior therapy program or Internet-Delivered Eating and Activity (IDEA) control condition with information on healthy eating habits and physical activity. During both the randomization/program kickoff visit and in their lesson materials, participants in both conditions received information pertaining to a healthy rate of weight loss and safe engagement in physical activity. The importance of regular contact with the referring physician for adjustments in medications was stressed. Access to the Internet interventions ended after 12 weeks in both groups. Both groups were assessed at the end of the 3-month program (posttreatment) and after 3 additional months of follow-up and received $25 and $50, respectively, for completing the assessments. Study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of The Miriam Hospital.Participants were 154 overweight or obese English-speaking individuals with a BMI of 25&#8211;45 kg/mParticipants were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment conditions using a computer-generated permuted blocking procedure, stratified by sex. A 1:1 randomization scheme was used. The allocation sequence was concealed until a patient consented to participate and had completed the baseline assessment.The Internet Behavioral Intervention (IBI) program included 12 weekly multimedia behavioral lessons, a website for submitting self-monitoring data, and weekly automated feedback provided to the participant on their progress to date. Participants were introduced to the IBI program at the 60-min randomization/program kickoff visit; they were given a goal of losing 1 to 2 lbs/week and achieving a total weight loss of &#8805;10% of initial body weight. To accomplish this, they were prescribed a calorie goal of 1,200&#8211;1,500 kcal/day depending on initial body weight with &#8804;30% calories from fat (40&#8211;60 g of fat/day) and a physical activity goal that gradually increased to 200 min/week of physical activity using activities similar in intensity to brisk walking. The remainder of the randomization/program kickoff visit was used to teach skills for self-monitoring daily food intake, physical activity minutes, and body weight. Participants received paper diaries and a calorie reference book for this purpose.Standard behavioral strategies for changing their eating and activity were taught to the participants by having them view weekly 10&#8211;15-min interactive multimedia behavioral weight-loss lessons. In contrast to previous studies using static lessons with text and graphics (At weeks 4, 8, and 12, a letter was sent to the referring physician (and copied to the participant) indicating the number of weeks the participant had submitted data and their weight loss at that point. The letters were intended to provide physicians with information on the outcome of their referral, facilitate communication about health behaviors between physicians and patients, and enhance patients&#8217; sense of accountability for their health and health behaviors.Participants in this education-only control condition were seen at the randomization/program kickoff visit and instructed to access the Rx Weight Loss website at least once weekly to view a new printable lesson with static text and graphics in the Adobe portable document format. These newsletters provided general educational information on the benefits of losing weight and healthy eating and physical activity habits. Participants were not taught behavioral weight-loss strategies and were not instructed to self-monitor their behaviors, but were encouraged to explore online resources such as choosemyplate.gov, which contains information and tools for weight loss. This condition mimicked what patients may receive during routine care: a recommendation to lose weight accompanied by general educational information. IDEA also served as a method for controlling for access to Internet-based resources.The primary outcome was change in body weight (kg, percent of initial body weight). Weight was measured in the research setting at baseline, 3 months (end of treatment), and 6 months (follow-up) in light street clothing, without shoes, and on a calibrated scale by blinded research staff. A secondary outcome was engagement with the Internet-based treatment system, which was measured by the number of weeks (out of 12) that participants logged in to the website, and, in the IBI group only, the number of weeks that calories, physical activity minutes, and body weight were reported for at least 5 of the 7 days. At baseline, participants reported their demographic characteristics and physician-diagnosed medical conditions. At baseline, 3, and 6 months, participants reported the number of weeks in the past 3 months that they had: PASW Statistics 19 (SPSS, Inc., 2009, Chicago, IL; </chapter><chapter title="Results">The CONSORT diagram is depicted in Participants&#8217; baseline characteristics are reported in Group-specific changes in weight at months 3 and 6 are depicted in IBI and IDEA did not differ significantly in the number of weeks (out of 12) that the website was used during the initial 3-month program (10.0 &#177; 3.0 in IBI and 9.5 &#177; 3.1 in IDEA; Participants in the IBI condition reported their daily caloric intake, physical activity minutes, and daily weight on the intervention website at least 5 days out of the week on 6.7 (4.7) of the 12 weeks.

In addition, 53% achieved a clinically significant weight loss of at least 5% of initial body weight at 3 months and 48% at 6 months. These results far exceeded the weight losses achieved by the patients who were randomly assigned to an Internet newsletter control condition and provide an effective, potentially low-cost option that physicians could use with their overweight and obese patients to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and other weight-related diseases.Engagement with the IBI website was quite high during treatment and correlated with weight-loss outcomes. Prior work suggests that feedback messages, perhaps to an even greater degree than online lessons, contributed to improved weight-loss outcomes in similar programs (Weight losses in the IBI condition appear to exceed those we achieved using a similar 3-month intervention in a community setting (3.5 kg weight loss at 3 months) (Previous studies of weight-loss interventions in primary care settings have primarily involved physician counseling, physician counseling combined with weight-loss medications, or delivery of the intervention by other office staff (There are several limitations to this study. First, the study lasted only 6 months, and thus, it is not clear if these weight losses will be maintained long term. Since participants in behavioral weight-loss programs typically lose weight for the first 3&#8211;6 months of treatment (Strengths of the study include the system of referrals from physicians, which required very little time on their part, and the fact that the approach we used is nearly fully automated and can thus be scaled for use with large numbers of patients at minimal additional cost. Moreover, we compared the IBI program to a control group that received weekly printable lessons via the Internet, thus controlling for engagement with the website and ongoing attention to weight control. The clinically significant weight loss in IBI but not the control group suggests that physician advice to lose weight combined with common diet and exercise information is insufficient and that behavioral strategies and feedback are also required to produce meaningful weight loss.In conclusion, physician referral to a behavioral Internet intervention, which includes weekly behavioral lessons and weekly automated feedback to patients on their self-monitoring records, with periodic written feedback to the physician, can be an effective approach for weight loss in overweight and obese individuals.

In observational studies, skeletal muscle mass loss is attenuated by use of insulin sensitizers in older men with diabetes (The strengths of our study are the comprehensive testing that was performed in BLSA and the assessment of both skeletal muscle strength and mass, allowing for characterization of muscle quality.

However, HbAWe chose to use HbAIn summary, our study demonstrates that hyperglycemia predicts persistently lower muscle strength after accounting for age-related effects but may be mediated, at least in part, by peripheral neuropathy. It remains unclear if hyperglycemia at different times of day (i.e., postprandial versus fasting) may have relatively greater impact on the accelerated loss of muscle; this should be explored in future studies. Further interventional studies are needed to better investigate if improving hyperglycemia and/or insulin resistance can impact loss of muscle strength or quality over time. Our findings may inform preventive efforts targeted at potentially preserving muscle function in older persons and, ultimately, can facilitate strategies to reduce the burden of disability for persons with diabetes.</chapter><chapter title="Supplementary Material" /></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4274787"><title>A quinol oxidase, encoded by </title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Microbiology</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Zachary R.</first-name><last-name>Lunak</last-name></author><author><first-name>K.

Unexpectedly, this reduced plasma Epi levels by 18% over 2 h relative to controls, and in a separate study, bilateral PFH sertraline dialysis (10 &#956;mol/L in 0.5 &#956;L) reduced the hyperglycemic effect of systemic 2-DG by 39% over 2 h (Given these in vivo findings, we next explored the effects of 5-HT on PFH neuronal excitability using fura-2 calcium imaging in dissociated PFH neurons (To test the hypothesis that 5-HT might alter the release of lactate from astrocytes as an additional mechanism by which 5-HT might modulate the CRR, cultured hypothalamic astrocytes held at 0.5 mmol/L glucose were exposed to 50 pmol/L 5-HT.

Further, while hypoglycemia activates 5-HT neurons throughout much of the forebrain, the adrenomedullary, but not feeding, response to PFH and systemic glucoprivation are dependent upon PFH 5-HT innervation. Finally, both PFH-evoked CRR and feeding are dependent upon orexin signaling.We initiated these studies based on the finding that SSRIs enhance the CRR to hypoglycemia (Our investigations focused on the PFH because of its known efferent connections to the adrenal medulla (Taken together, these results suggest that the PFH is an important mediator of the adrenomedullary response to IIH and confirm prior findings (As a potential mechanism for the release of Epi and stimulation of feeding, we confirmed reports of others (While the neuronal cell bodies of the 5-HT neurons in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei that innervate the PFH are not glucosensing (We originally postulated that local dialysis of sertraline into the PFH would increase synaptic 5-HT availability and enhance the CRR to glucoprivation. Instead, this inhibited the CRR, suggesting that blockade of 5-HT reuptake, the major source of presynaptic 5-HT release during activation of 5-HT neurons (In conclusion, we have identified a novel role for the PFH in regulating adrenomedullary and feeding responses under conditions of metabolic emergency in awake, freely behaving animals. These responses are mediated, in part, by PFH orexin neurons and 5-HT signaling. Future studies are needed to elaborate the role of the PFH, orexin neurons, and 5-HT signaling in the broader glucoregulatory network and the contribution these players make to the physiology and pathophysiology of hypoglycemia counterregulation.</chapter><chapter title="Supplementary Material" /></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4274799"><title>Impaired Macromolecular Protein Pools in Fronto-Striato-Thalamic Circuits in Type 2 Diabetes Revealed by Magnetization Transfer Imaging</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Diabetes</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Shaolin</first-name><last-name>Yang</last-name></author><author><first-name>Olusola</first-name><last-name>Ajilore</last-name></author><author><first-name>Minjie</first-name><last-name>Wu</last-name></author><author><first-name>Melissa</first-name><last-name>Lamar</last-name></author><author><first-name>Anand</first-name><last-name>Kumar</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Pathophysiology</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Introduction">Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with metabolic and macro- and microvascular complications in multiple organ systems, including the brain (Magnetization transfer (MT) imaging exploits magnetization exchange between protons bound to macromolecules and free protons in tissue water. In MT imaging, an off-resonance prepulse is applied to selectively saturate bound protons, and magnetization is then transferred from saturated bound protons to free protons through chemical exchange and direct dipolar coupling. This transfer of magnetization leads to decreased magnetic resonance signal from free protons. The contrast between MT images with and without the saturation prepulse is defined as magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) (Despite the unique features of MT imaging, there are very few MT studies on T2DM in the literature. The only published MT study was on T2DM and major depression in combination, which focused on subcortical regions and found compromised macromolecular protein pools in the head of the caudate nucleus (hCaud) in T2DM patients (Fronto-striato-thalamic circuits have been implicated in the pathophysiology of several mood and associated cognitive disorders (More specifically, this study investigated brain regions/structures associated with the dorsolateral prefrontal, lateral orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate frontal-subcortical circuits&#8212;circuits that are neurobiologically relevant in human behavior, including cognitive control, decision making, action planning and execution, learning and working memory, attention, and emotional processing (</chapter><chapter title="Research Design and Methods">The subject population consisted of 20 T2DM patients without mood disorders (aged 65.05 &#177; 11.95 years) and 26 nondiabetic HCs (aged 62.92 &#177; 12.71 years). Subjects were selected from a larger sample of a research program on diabetes and depression at the University of Illinois at Chicago. All participants were aged 30 years and older and recruited from the greater Chicago area through flyers, local advertisements, and relevant outpatient clinics. The study was approved by the University of Illinois at Chicago Institutional Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.The diagnosis of T2DM in patients was made by their primary care physicians and was confirmed using American Diabetes Association guidelines (Exclusion criteria included any current or past history of neurological and psychiatric disorders (e.g., dementia, stroke, seizure, transient ischemic attack, or depression), learning disability or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, psychotropic medication, current or past history of substance abuse or dependence, history of head injury or loss of consciousness, a MMSE score less than 24, or any contraindication to MRI scan such as metal in the body, surgically implanted devices containing metal, claustrophobia, and pregnancy.All participants were assessed for medical comorbidity using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) (A neuropsychological battery was conducted on each participant across three domains: learning and memory (California Verbal Learning Test [Second Edition] immediate total recall and long-delay free recall [MRI was performed on a Philips Achieva 3.0T scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) with a body coil for transmission and a Philips 8-channel SENSE Head coil for reception.

The study is limited by its relatively small sample size (20 patients with T2DM and 26 HCs), which may have limited the power to detect subtle changes in some regions of the fronto-striato-thalamic circuits in T2DM patients. Furthermore, the relatively small sample size restricted our ability to examine specific task-level cognitive processes. Thus a composite Z score approach was used to protect against multiple comparisons. In addition, a cross-sectional instead of longitudinal design was used in this study. The cross-sectional design is inherently more vulnerable to intersubject variance and cohort effects. Therefore, future studies are needed to increase the sample size and to investigate the relationship between biophysical integrity of macromolecular protein pools and specific cognitive functions.In conclusion, our study found compromised macromolecular protein pools in bilateral anterior cingulate and the head of the right caudate nucleus in T2DM patients compared with control subjects. Moreover, the compromised biophysical properties of macromolecular protein pools represented by lower MTR were correlated with T2DM-related clinical measures and neuropsychological task performance in distinct domains. This study is the first to report impaired macromolecular protein pools in frontal-subcortical circuits and its clinical and cognitive correlates in patients with T2DM. These findings contribute to the growing literature in brain alterations in T2DM and have important implications for the underlying neurobiology of diabetes.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4274800"><title>Compartmentalized Acyl-CoA Metabolism in Skeletal Muscle Regulates Systemic Glucose Homeostasis</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Diabetes</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Lei O.</first-name><last-name>Li</last-name></author><author><first-name>Trisha J.</first-name><last-name>Grevengoed</last-name></author><author><first-name>David S.</first-name><last-name>Paul</last-name></author><author><first-name>Olga</first-name><last-name>Ilkayeva</last-name></author><author><first-name>Timothy R.</first-name><last-name>Koves</last-name></author><author><first-name>Florencia</first-name><last-name>Pascual</last-name></author><author><first-name>Christopher B.</first-name><last-name>Newgard</last-name></author><author><first-name>Deborah M.</first-name><last-name>Muoio</last-name></author><author><first-name>Rosalind A.</first-name><last-name>Coleman</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Metabolism</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Introduction">Skeletal muscle switches between the use of glucose and lipid, depending on fuel availability and energy requirements.

We did not see an effect of MR blockade on diastolic function, possibly related to the lack of diastolic dysfunction at baseline, or on myocardial extracellular volume, possibly because cardiac remodeling takes longer than 6 months. Due to spironolactone&#8217;s effects on potassium homeostasis, we restricted this study to individuals with good renal function.

Among these participants, information on IBS cases was obtained from the Bureau of National Health Insurance claim database, which covered the medical services of &#8764;95% of the entire population from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2004 (In the present study, anthropometric measurements (including blood pressure, height, weight and waist circumference), information on demographic characteristics (including age, gender and education) and lifestyle, family history and a series of biochemical variables were also collected and used at the first entry of screening. When classifying the years of education, we classified education into three levels. Six years or less of education was classified as low education level. Between 6 and 12 years of education was classified as medium education level. Twelve years of education or above was classified as high education level. Current or former smokers were placed in the smoking group. Similarly, current or former drinkers were placed in the alcoholic-drinking group. Exercise frequency was categorised into three groups (never, low and high). Exercise time less than 100&#8201;min per week was defined as the low-frequency group, whereas exercise time over 100&#8201;min per week was defined as the high-frequency group.Patients with blood pressure &#10878;140&#8201;mm&#8201;Hg/90&#8201;mm&#8201;Hg or those with a history of hypertension were placed in the hypertension group.

In contrast to the diagnosis of IBS using the Rome II questionnaire survey, we used national health insurance data to make the IBS diagnosis. As a portion of IBS patients, especially those with mild symptoms, do not seek medical help, underestimation of the prevalence of IBS is highly suspected, especially among younger people. This could explain why our study showed a lower IBS prevalence among people aged 40&#8211;49 years than what was found in the previous study.In the past, IBS was viewed as a purely functional disorder. However, in recent years, numerous data have suggested that immune activation occurs in IBS patients (In the present study, we found that IBS patients were associated with a significantly higher risk of colorectal adenoma and colon neoplasia compared with those without IBS. Three possible reasons could explain why IBS patients have a higher risk of developing colon neoplasia. First, IBS and colon neoplasia have similar clinical symptoms that result in the higher detection rate of colon neoplasia. Second, IBS and colon neoplasia share common risk factors. Third, IBS has a causal role in the pathogenesis of colon neoplasia.Two previous studies from the United Kingdom and Denmark revealed a lack of relationship between IBS and CRC after excluding CRCs within the first year of follow-up (IBS is a clinical syndrome diagnosed by clinical presentation after removal of the structural abnormality (The risk factors of IBS are still unclear; however, several have been identified by epidemiologic studies over the past few decades. However, it is difficult to separate factors promoting health-care seeking from true risk factors for the disease (</chapter><chapter title="Conclusion">Our study finds a significant association between IBS and colon neoplasia, and it provides an important suggestion to clinical physicians: they should pay more attention to IBS and the possibility of colon neoplasia or CRC in patients.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4453617"><title>New small molecules, ISA27 and SM13, inhibit tumour growth inducing mitochondrial effects of p53</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>British Journal of Cancer</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>D</first-name><last-name>Sorriento</last-name></author><author><first-name>C</first-name><last-name>Del Giudice</last-name></author><author><first-name>A</first-name><last-name>Bertamino</last-name></author><author><first-name>M</first-name><last-name>Ciccarelli</last-name></author><author><first-name>I</first-name><last-name>Gomez-Monterrey</last-name></author><author><first-name>P</first-name><last-name>Campiglia</last-name></author><author><first-name>E</first-name><last-name>Novellino</last-name></author><author><first-name>M</first-name><last-name>Illario</last-name></author><author><first-name>B</first-name><last-name>Trimarco</last-name></author><author><first-name>N</first-name><last-name>De Luca</last-name></author><author><first-name>G</first-name><last-name>Iaccarino</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Translational Therapeutics</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Materials and Methods">MCF7, which express a WT variant of p53, KAT-4, which bears a p53 variant mutated at codon 273 (CLyophilised ISA27 and SM13 were dissolved in absolute DMSO.

In most patients, the switch from first-line treatment with TKI to second-line everolimus is made upon occurrence of documented development of tumour PG. Sunitinib is regarded as an antiangiogenic agent inducing vascular disruption, hypoxia, and tumour necrosis. Either as a consequence of pharmacological mechanisms or as a result of constitutively activated hypoxia pathways in the tumour, some clinical data and data from animal models have also suggested that the development of resistance was associated with a more aggressive phenotype. Consequently, attempts have been made to counteract acquired resistance to sunitinib and clinical trials have been developed aiming to switch between active compounds displaying distinct mechanisms of action before the occurrence of acquired resistance.The aim of our study was to look at changes in human tumours exposed to sequential administration of sunitinib and everolimus to provide information that could serve for clinical trials aiming at delaying tumour PG in RCC patients. In our study, we tested three different sequences of sunitinib and everolimus consisting of every week (1W), every 2 weeks (2W), and every 3 weeks (3W) alternation (Recent data from literature highlighted the possible correlation between EMT and sunitinib resistance in ccRCC (Sequential regimens were all efficient in inhibiting angiogenesis as determined by reduction in the number of tumour vessels and tumour vascular areas. Interestingly, as shown earlier (How alternate sequences of sunitinib and everolimus translate into clinical setting remains difficult to evaluate in the absence of specific clinical trial. In the RECORD-3 study comparing sunitinib until progression followed by everolimus In summary, the use of a sequential combination strategy using alternate treatments with sunitinib and everolimus may be an interesting approach to control tumour PG and postpone the emergence of resistance mechanisms such as the EMT.

The peripheral cells were also disregarded and excluded from further examination. The Nikon Imaging software Advanced Research 3.1 (Nikon, D&#252;sseldorf, Germany; NIS AR Version 3.1) was used for recording and quantitative examination. Cell shape transformation was quantified by calculating the extent of elongation using the following formula:Elongation factor (EF)=maxFeret/minFeret (NIS AR 3.1) (where Feret's diameter is the distance between two parallel lines restricting the object perpendicular to its specified direction and max/minFeret is the maximal/minimal Feret's diameter of an object.

Instead of the expected general transmigration, all PDAC cells exhibited a specific migration pattern and were almost exclusively found at cell&#8211;cell boundaries of the epithelial monolayers. During this process, several cell lines underwent EMT typical morphological changes, such as the development of an elongated shape from an initial round cell shape. Cell elongation appeared to be a significant process during PDAC peritoneal metastasis, and we thus classified the investigated cell lines according to their exhibited elongation (MEF classification).Besides quantitative analysis via MEF classification, the qualitative observation of the elongation suggested that PDAC cells were influenced by To discriminate between EMT- and adhesion-associated effects, the adhesion potency and velocity of the PDAC cell lines were compared: the significantly more elongated cell lines of group A showed significantly higher adhesion properties than the more round group B cell lines (Thus, it appears that the integrating PDAC cells could have been influenced by In summary, the present results indicate that the development of PDAC peritoneal carcinomatosis is characterised by integration into HMC monolayers rather than by transmigration. Different PDAC cell lines exhibited varying ability to integrate into the monolayer of the mesothelium. The disposition to integrate could be advantageous for cell survival and for the development of peritoneal dissemination and consequently could lead to more metastatic phenotypes.Surprisingly, integration properties of PDAC cells into HMC monolayers inversely correlated with the previously reported extent of distant metastasis formation, mainly determined by liver colonisation (We hypothesised that epigenetic mechanisms have a role not only for the pancreatic cancer development (The expression of Wnt-related genes leads to cell shape changes toward elongation (Group B cell lines showed increased expression of E-cadherin and Similarly, our microarray results showed an overall decreased expression of E-cadherin in group A cell lines, which however remained below the threshold for significance (5.08-fold increased expression in group B after altered algorithm (without the correction by Westfall&#8211;Young permutation)) (The present data suggest that each of the three deregulated targets (FZD5, TMEM92 and HNF1B) &#8211; independently or in combination &#8211; could influence the two highly connected EMT-related systems: the canonical Wnt/In the Frizzled family, FZD5 is one of eleven known receptor proteins (FZD1-10, SMO).

Only 10 out of 28 markers (35%) could be verified in a univariate Cox approach and only 4 (14%) were subsequently confirmed as significant in a multivariate setting. According to these results, the loss of stromal androgen receptor expression was the biomarker with the most significant prognostic impact (hazard ratio 3.33); a finding that doubtlessly deserves further investigation. This rather remarkable discrepancy of published data and this study's results might be explained by either significant shortcomings of this verification study or general deficits in the publication culture concerning prognostic markers that may be either over-optimistic or too permissive.Concerning the former, great care was taken to minimise potential biases in the conduction of this study. The study cohort, which comprised 238 primary prostate cancer patients, is a well established, contemporary, monocentric prostatectomy cohort which has been extensively used in previous publications (The most apparent deficit of the original studies lies in their study design, which was generally based on a retrospective analysis of a single cohort. This type of analysis is prone to model overfitting and is nowadays increasingly regarded as only hypothesis-generating because the important validation is missing. A more appropriate approach includes an initial analysis of a training cohort to establish a test hypothesis and a cut-off value, which is then verified in an independent testing cohort. In a way, this study provides the necessary testing cohort for these studies, even though under considerably tightened conditions with probable differences in surgery, in the pre-analytic steps, the immunostaining protocols, and the analytical attitude of the observers in the interpretation of immunostainings. The impact of correct statistical handling in biomarker studies has long been recognised and has led to several recommendations (An additional potential bias lies in the composition of the respective cohort under analysis, which may also influence biomarker performance (A general deficit of most TMA-based studies is the missing demonstration of relevant construction bias. Ideally, a new TMA should be verified with a panel of established markers prior to the analysis of new candidates, and this confirmative data should be included in the The main restriction of immunohistochemistry as a technique is missing normalisation. Many factors influence the final signal intensity, considering differences in pre-analytic steps, section thickness, antigen retrieval techniques, antibody quality and concentration, and detection systems. To our knowledge, the approach of normalising an immunohistochemical staining signal by simultaneous measurement of a &#8216;housekeeping protein' has not been pursued widely and is a field that needs to be developed in the future. Certainly, this would necessitate computer-aided image analysis, which, taken by itself, has not been a major breakthrough so far (The search for molecular prognostic markers for malignant tumours has been a central aim of biomedical researchers in the last two decades. A more concise diagnosis provided by a molecular marker may facilitate individualised patient treatment. Additionally, prognostic markers might help to unravel the molecular background of tumour progression and even represent an attractive new therapeutic target. Ideally, a prognostic factor only has a few degrees of freedom and allows for a dichotomous or trichotomous readout (e.g., negative/positive or nil/low/high) to ensure a high degree of reproducibility. Unfortunately, this does not exactly hold true for the majority of biomarkers measured on expression level, which necessitate cut-off values to delineate meaningful prognostic subgroups. As these cut-off values are mainly arbitrarily chosen, and the most popular platform to determine protein expression in tumour tissues is immunohistochemistry, it does not surprise that the reproducibility of these prognostic markers is limited (Although most authors of prognostic biomarker studies in prostate cancer investigate markers for therapy planning at the biopsy stage, these studies, as exemplified in our selection, mainly use RPE specimens (and not preoperatively sampled biopsy material) and analyse disease progression following radical prostatectomy. The inherent but to our knowledge unproven assumption is that markers of disease progression following surgery can also be used upfront to estimate the tumours' endogenous aggressiveness; or, in other words, that We are convinced that the final and most crucial step in verification of a biomarker for therapy planning at the initial biopsy stage would be a prospective trial in an active surveillance cohort. A reliable biomarker should then be able to identify insignificant tumours that can safely be kept under surveillance for a longer time and do not necessitate active treatment because of the criteria of tumour progression. Even then, long-term follow-up data with either cancer-specific death or onset of castration refractory disease as an endpoint would be highly desirable. Another open point of discussion is, if the commonly used surrogate marker of disease progression, PSA relapse, is delineating a clinically meaningful endpoint, because many patients with a PSA progression will die of other, non-cancer related causes (In summary, this study sheds some very critical light on contemporary immunohistochemistry studies that aim to identify prognostic biomarkers for prostate cancer. Acknowledging the inherent limitations of this comprehensive meta-analysis and verification study, the majority of published biomarkers could not be confirmed. This is disappointing but in excellent concordance with the skeptical view of biostatisticians and may also be true for other tumour entities (</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4493995"><title>p53 censuses centrosomes</title><article-type>news</article-type><journal-title>The Journal of Cell Biology</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Mitch</first-name><last-name>Leslie</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>News</category></article-categories><chapters /></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4493996"><title>VAMP8-dependent fusion of recycling endosomes with the plasma membrane facilitates T lymphocyte cytotoxicity</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>The Journal of Cell Biology</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Misty R.</first-name><last-name>Marshall</last-name></author><author><first-name>Varsha</first-name><last-name>Pattu</last-name></author><author><first-name>Mahantappa</first-name><last-name>Halimani</last-name></author><author><first-name>Monika</first-name><last-name>Maier-Peuschel</last-name></author><author><first-name>Martha-Lena</first-name><last-name>M&#252;ller</last-name></author><author><first-name>Ute</first-name><last-name>Becherer</last-name></author><author><first-name>Wanjin</first-name><last-name>Hong</last-name></author><author><first-name>Markus</first-name><last-name>Hoth</last-name></author><author><first-name>Thomas</first-name><last-name>Tschernig</last-name></author><author><first-name>Yenan T.</first-name><last-name>Bryceson</last-name></author><author><first-name>Jens</first-name><last-name>Rettig</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Research Articles</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Introduction">Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) together with natural killer cells can recognize and kill infected and neoplastic cells. Killing by these cell types is mediated by exocytosis of specialized secretory lysosomes, called cytotoxic granules, which contain the cytotoxic proteins perforin and granzymes (In eukaryotes, exocytosis as well as intracellular vesicle fusion processes is mediated by transmembrane proteins containing cytoplasmic SNARE domains (Whereas SNARE-dependent exocytosis has been extensively studied in the context of neurotransmitter release, current research shows that SNARE-dependent exocytosis is also critical for proper immunological function (The vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) family typically mediates fusion of vesicles with cognate, membrane-associated SNARE complexes, and several VAMPs have been implicated in lymphocyte cytotoxicity. Here, we studied the role of VAMP8 in cytotoxic granule fusion in primary human lymphocytes using structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Examining endogenous as well as fluorescently tagged, ectopically expressed protein, we established that VAMP8 is associated with the recycling endosome compartment rather than with cytotoxic granules. Complimentary approaches revealed that recycling endosomes rapidly accumulated and fused at the immune synapse, preceding the arrival of cytotoxic granules. Strikingly, reduction of VAMP8 expression compromised both recycling endosome and cytotoxic granule fusion, delineating a VAMP8-dependent fusion step between recycling endosomes and the plasma membrane that brings Stx11 to the immune synapse for cytotoxic granule exocytosis. These insights provide a new mechanistic view of cytotoxic lymphocyte exocytosis and bear relevance to how VAMP8 may support regulated secretion in several other cell types.</chapter><chapter title="Results">We examined human CTL expression of VAMP8, which from studies of knockout mice has been suggested to represent the vesicular SNARE required for cytotoxic granule exocytosis. Studies in mice have indicated that VAMP8 is recruited to the immune synapse of CTLs (We set out to decipher how VAMP8 may facilitate cytotoxic granule exocytosis. In contrast to studies of mouse CTL (Having established that VAMP8 did not colocalize with cytotoxic granules, we sought the identity of the endosomal compartment that did contain VAMP8. CTLs were transfected with VAMP8-TFP and various endosomal markers coupled to mCherry. CTLs were thereafter mixed with SEA-pulsed target cells, fixed, and imaged using SIM. Imaging revealed limited colocalization between VAMP8 and Rab5a, a marker of early endosomes (Although VAMP8 exhibited strong colocalization with recycling endosomes in our fixed cell experiments, it was unclear whether these VAMP8 vesicles were also trafficking through the recycling endosome compartment and fusing at the immune synapse. To examine the behavior of VAMP8-carrying vesicles, we used TIRF microscopy to visualize vesicle dynamics in the vicinity of the immune synapse. This technique allows real-time visualization of vesicles within 200 nm of the immune synapse (Interestingly, several rapid fluorescence dispersion events, characteristic of vesicle fusion, were also observed in the TIRF plane (Video 2). Such events were defined as a sudden reduction in fluorescence within 400 ms (i.e., four images), which could be distinguished from movement of granules back into the cell (undocking) that typically lasted &gt;1 s (see Materials and methods for analysis details). Cells exhibited a similar number of such fusion-like events for both VAMP8-TFP and Rab11a-mCherry (46.9 &#177; 6.4 vs. 54.0 &#177; 8.1; To formally demonstrate fusion of VAMP8-carrying recycling endosomes with the plasma membrane, we transfected CTLs with a construct encoding VAMP8 tagged with C-terminal, lumenal 3&#215;FLAG and TFP. Upon fusion of VAMP8-carrying vesicles, the FLAG-tag will be exposed to the extracellular milieu. Addition of the anti-FLAG antibody to the extracellular milieu followed by flow cytometry and gating on TFP-expressing cells revealed some constitutive expression of VAMP8 on the plasma membrane (To gain further insights to the relationship between VAMP8-carrying recycling endosome activity and cytotoxic granule exocytosis at human immune synapses, CTLs were cotransfected with VAMP8-TFP and perforin-mCherry and allowed to form a synapse with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibody-coated coverslips. CTLs were imaged in real-time by TIRF microscopy. Interestingly, in live-cell imaging, multiple VAMP8-carrying recycling endosomes rapidly appeared in the TIRF plane followed by fewer perforin-containing vesicles (To determine whether VAMP8 regulates human CTL vesicle exocytosis, we attempted to knockdown the expression of VAMP8 by transfection of CTL with four To test the involvement of VAMP8 in recycling endosome fusion, we performed TIRF microscopy of CTLs cotransfected with Rab11a-mCherry and control siRNA or VAMP8 siRNA. Knockdown of VAMP8 did not significantly change the mean dwell time of Rab11a-carrying vesicles (17.8 &#177; 0.5 vs. 21.1 &#177; 2.4; Studies of knockout mice have implicated VAMP8 in many forms of secretory granule secretion (To further dissect the mechanism whereby VAMP8 facilitates lymphocyte cytotoxicity, we first studied the impact of VAMP8 knockdown on TCR signaling in human CTLs. CTLs were transfected with control siRNA or VAMP8 siRNA, labeled with Fluo-4 and Fura red CaWe have recently shown that Stx11 localizes to recycling endosomes in human CTLs (</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">The mechanisms of lymphocyte cytotoxicity have not been fully elucidated (CTLs survey tissues for aberrant cells and can engage and kill target cells within 2 min through regulated exocytosis of specialized secretory lysosomes (Several genes required for cytotoxic granule exocytosis have been linked to development of early onset, often fatal hyperinflammatory syndromes such as HLH. Loss-of-function mutations in VAMP8 was originally identified as a widely expressed R-SNARE predominantly localized to the early endocytic pathway (The identity of other components of the SNARE complex mediating recycling endosome fusion in CTLs is not clear. VAMP8 can form a complex with Stx7, Stx8, and Vti1b for late endosome to lysosome fusion (In conclusion, our findings reveal a role for VAMP8 in fusion of recycling endosomes with the plasma membrane. In CTLs, our data demonstrate that VAMP8-dependent recycling endosome fusion mediates plasma membrane delivery of proteins, i.e., Stx11, specifically required for cytotoxic granule exocytosis. Our data provide a new mechanistic view of cytotoxic lymphocyte exocytosis. In conjunction with the literature on VAMP8, our findings may warrant further high-resolution functional dissection of exocytosis in other cell types in which VAMP8 has been implicated in release of secretory granule content.</chapter><chapter title="Materials and methods">Research with human material performed for this study has been approved by the local ethics committee. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation (Lymphoprep; Axis-Shield). In some experiments, PBMCs were stimulated with 5 &#181;g/ml of SEA at a density of 10For Western blotting, rabbit polyclonal anti-VAMP8 (V7389; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-phospho-p42/44 MAPK (Erk1/2, Thr202/Tyr204; 9101; Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies were used. Secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated donkey anti&#8211;rabbit (Invitrogen). For confocal microscopy, mouse monoclonal anti-perforin (&#948;G9; BioLegend) and anti&#8211;granzyme B (GB11; BioLegend) as well as rabbit polyclonal anti-VAMP8 (W. Hong) antibodies were used. The VAMP8 antibody was generated using residues 1&#8211;75 of VAMP8, expressed as a fusion protein to GST (GST-endobrevin) and used to raise polyclonal antibodies against endobrevin. For TIRF microscopy and flow cytometric assays, mouse anti&#8211;human monoclonal anti-CD3 (BB11; Euroclone), mouse anti&#8211;human CD28 (CD28.2; BD), and mouse anti&#8211;human isotype IgG1 (MOPC-21; BD) antibodies were used for coating coverslips and stimulating cells. For flow cytometry stainings, fluorochrome-conjugated mouse anti&#8211;human monoclonal antibodies were used as follows: anti-CD3 (S4.1; Invitrogen), anti-CD4 (S3.5; Invitrogen), anti-CD8 (3B5; Invitrogen), anti-CD107a (H4A3; BD), and anti-FLAG (M2; GenScript).The Total RNA was extracted (TRIzol; Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed (SuperScript II; Invitrogen) using random hexamer primers. Quantitative PCR was performed using specific Human CTLs were homogenized with a syringe in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM deoxycholate, protease inhibitors, and PhosSTOP [Roche]) on ice. Lysates were rotated for 30 min at 4&#176;C, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 RCF. The protein concentration in lysates was determined using Bradford assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE; Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen), and blocked by incubation with 5% skim milk powder in 20 mM Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4, and TBS for 2 h or overnight and blotted with specific antibodies. Blots were developed using enhanced chemoluminescence reagents (SuperSignal West Dura Chemoluminescent Substrate; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and scanned. For expression analysis, the pixel area and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) were determined with ImageJ v1.46 (National Institutes of Health). Integrated density was calculated by multiplying band pixel area by the MFI.After 2 d of bead stimulation, 5 &#215; 10To conjugate CTLs with target cells, Raji cells were pulsed with 10 &#181;g/ml SEA at 37&#176;C for 30 min. The stimulation of Raji cells was performed in 96-well plates with a maximum of one million cells resuspended in 100 &#181;l AIM V medium. The CTL- and SEA-pulsed Raji cells were washed once with AIM V and resuspended at a concentration of 2 &#215; 10The setup consisted of an inverted microscope (Optical IX70; Olympus), a solid-state laser system (85YCA010; Melles Griot) emitting at 561 nm, a TILL-TIRF condenser (T.I.L.L. Photonics), and an Acousto Optical Tunable Filter-nC (AA Opto-Electronic). The excitation/emission wavelengths were visualized with a dual-view camera splitter (Visitron Systems) to separate the red and green channels and a monochromator (Visichrome; Visitron Systems) to acquire images in epifluorescence. The setup was equipped with a camera (MicroMAX 512 BFT; Princeton Instruments) controlled by MetaMorph (Visitron Systems). A 100&#215;/1.45 NA TIRF objective (Olympus Optical) was used. For some experiments, cells were imaged using a multiphoton confocal microscope (A1R; Nikon) with a 60&#215;/1.49 NA Plan Apochromat objective using 488- and 561-nm lasers and a camera (iXon X3; Andor Technology). The exposure time was 100&#8211;150 ms. Experiments were performed at room temperature. Images were acquired using MetaMorph version 6.3 or NIS Elements (Nikon).For live-cell imaging, human bead-stimulated CTLs were transfected with plasmids, washed, and resuspended in 30 &#181;l AIM V medium and allowed to settle on anti-CD3&#8211; and anti-CD28&#8211;coated coverslips in an isotonic CaImages and time-lapse series were analyzed using MetaMorph 6.3, ImageJ 1.46r, or the FIJI package of ImageJ. For vesicle dwell time and fusion analysis, analysis was performed with ImageJ 1.46r. Vesicles were defined as constituting 4&#8211;6 pixels. Dwell times in the TIRF plane were calculated manually for all vesicles in a cell. Cytotoxic granule fusion analysis was performed using ImageJ plugin Time Series Analyzer v.2.0. A sudden drop in the fluorescence within or &lt;300 ms (three frames) was defined as a (fusion-like) fluorescence dispersion event.Accumulation analysis was performed with ImageJ 1.46r. In brief, raw data files obtained from TIRF microscopy acquisitions were converted to 8 bits, and background was subtracted from the raw data of TIRF stacks using a Lipschitz filter with a top hat of 10. A threshold for vesicle accumulation was set as the mean gray value of background added 2 SD. The mean fluorescence of the area above threshold was obtained for every frame of the time-lapse video for each individual cell. A ratio was made between the threshold area and number of vesicles for a minimum of 10 frames for every cell (area/no. of vesicles = ratio). The threshold area was then divided by this ratio for all the time frames to get the number of vesicles for each frame. The mean number of vesicles in several cells was then plotted against the time (To quantify the F-actin clearance ratio at the immunological synapse, the MFI of the whole cell actin (MF1) was subtracted from the inner circular region of interest in the center of the immune synapse (MF2). Thus, a negative value indicates that the outer region has higher mean intensity than the inner region. The actin intensities were then divided by the actin footprint (MF1 &#215; area of MF1) to normalize the data, averaged, and plotted against time.For evaluation of VAMP8 surface expression or cytotoxic granule exocytosis, human PBMCs were isolated from healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation (Lymphoprep).

Fig. S2 shows that VAMP8 vesicles localize with Rab11a on recycling endosomal structures. Fig. S3 shows that VAMP8-carrying vesicles are rapidly recruited to and fuse with the plasma membrane at cytotoxic lymphocyte immune synapses. Fig. S4 shows that VAMP8 is not colocalized with granzyme B&#8211;containing granules. Fig. S5 shows that VAMP8 expression is strongly down-regulated and proximal TCR signaling is normal when VAMP8 expression in down-regulated by siRNA.

Video 2 shows that VAMP8 vesicles traffic and accumulate at the immune synapse with recycling endosomes markers upon antigen receptor engagement. Video 3 shows that VAMP8-carrying recycling endosomes are rapidly recruited to and fuse with the plasma membrane at immune synapses. Video 4 shows that VAMP8-carrying and perforin-containing vesicles have different spatial and temporal characteristics. Video 5 shows that VAMP8 and granzyme B have different spatial and temporal characteristics. Video 6 shows that recycling endosome fusion is inhibited upon knockdown of endogenous VAMP8 expression. Video 7 shows that cytotoxic granule fusion is inhibited upon knockdown of endogenous VAMP8 expression.

Immediately distal to the basal body lies the transition zone, distinguished by several conserved features, including a central cylinder or apical ring that lies internal to the microtubule doublets and Y-links connecting axonemal microtubules to the ciliary membrane (During ciliogenesis, centrioles dock to a membrane, either to a vesicle in the cytoplasm that fuses with the plasma membrane (The nematode </chapter><chapter title="Results and discussion">Increasing evidence points to the transition zone being organized into multiple protein complexes or modules with distinct functions.

A commonly used method to assess cilia integrity in While cilia assembly was largely unaffected in transition zone mutants, neuronal morphology was strongly perturbed. This was most clearly seen in phasmids, where dendrites collapsed almost entirely, with cilia found immediately adjacent to the cell body (Dendrite extension in amphids has been shown to occur by retrograde extension, whereby the cell body migrates backward while the dendritic tip remains anchored in place (Cilia could contribute to neuronal morphology in a variety of ways, including by signaling. However, dendrite extension occurs before cilia are fully formed (Dendrite extension in PQR neurons has been reported to occur in the canonical, anterograde manner by growth cone crawling (For a structure at the dendritic tip to provide anchorage during retrograde extension, it must interact with neighboring cells or other immobile structures. For amphids, that structure is the extracellular matrix, composed in part of the tectorin-related proteins DEX-1 and DYF-7. Loss of either protein results in loss of anchorage and dendrite collapse (In summary, our work has helped clarify the molecular architecture and function of the ciliary transition zone (see also A second major conclusion of our work is that the transition zone is required for adhesion to the extracellular matrix to allow dendrite extension. While cilia have not previously been implicated in cell adhesion, signs of crosstalk have been observed for many years.

Imaging was performed at room temperature on the set-up described above. For examination of neuronal morphology and localization interdependencies, 3D wide-field datasets were acquired, deconvolved, and processed as described above. Exposure conditions and scaling were kept constant when comparing signal across mutant backgrounds. At least 10 animals were examined per condition. Dendrite lengths (from cell body to ciliary base) and cilia dimensions (base to tip) were measured in MetaMorph on strains expressing CHE-11:GFP. For examination of protein localization at high spatial resolution, L4 larvae coexpressing GFP-tagged transition zone proteins and mCherry:HYLS-1 were imaged with the additional use of a 1.6&#215; optovar, and deconvolved image stacks were analyzed in MetaMorph. Where phasmid cilia lay flat within the image plane, the dimensions of GFP and mCherry signals were measured using the linescan function and averaged over &gt;20 cilia per strain. Potential shifts between GFP and mCherry signals due to chromatic aberration were excluded by imaging a strain coexpressing the same protein in both colors.

The cartwheel then templates the formation of a procentriole by providing a scaffold onto which microtubules are loaded (Previous approaches to study the immediate consequence of centriole loss in human cells have relied on laser ablation or microsurgery (Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) has emerged as a conserved, dose-dependent regulator of centriole copy number and offers an attractive target to reversibly modulate centriole number in populations of cells (In this study, we developed a chemical genetics approach to rapidly and reversibly control Plk4 protein abundance in cells. Manipulating endogenous Plk4 levels allowed the reversible depletion of centrioles from populations of cycling cells and uncovered the existence of a p53-dependent pathway that guards against genome instability by preventing cellular proliferation after centriole duplication failure. By taking advantage of the acute and titratable depletion of Plk4, our data define the threshold level of Plk4 required for centriole assembly and establish the consequence of acute Plk4 depletion on centriole composition.</chapter><chapter title="Results">To study the immediate effects caused by Plk4 depletion, we turned to an auxin-inducible degradation system that allows for posttranslational control of protein abundance with the plant hormone auxin (We used sequential rounds of gene targeting to knock-in the AID onto the C terminus of both endogenous Plk4 alleles in nontransformed, telomerase-immortalized, human RPE-1 cells (We stably expressed osTIR1-9xMyc in Plk4To examine whether treatment with IAA leads to the expected failure of centriole duplication, we assessed centriole number in cells undergoing mitosis one cell cycle (30 h) after IAA addition.

The ability to rapidly remove Plk4 from cells provided an opportunity to identify proteins that directly depend on Plk4 for recruitment to the centriole. We used immunofluorescence microscopy to examine the abundance of 10 proteins (CPAP, CEP135, CEP152, CEP192, SAS6, CNAP1, CEP164, Centrin, &#947;-tubulin, and STIL) at the centrosome 1 h after Plk4 destruction with IAA.

This is the first time the auxin-inducible destruction system has been used to reversibly manipulate the levels of an endogenous protein in vertebrate cells. In principle, the strategy we have taken could be applied to control the levels of many proteins that are not amenable to traditional chemical inhibition. In the future, combining the AID system with CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering will greatly increase the efficiency with which biallelic targeting of endogenous genes can be achieved, paving the way for rapid and tunable control of protein function.The long-term consequence of centriole depletion has not been studied in a nontransformed vertebrate cell line. By inducing chronic depletion of Plk4, we reveal the presence of a p53-dependent pathway that arrests the growth of untransformed cells after a failure of centriole duplication (Whereas mouse embryos proceed through many cell divisions without centrioles before initiating apoptosis, we found that many human somatic cells ceased dividing before the total loss of centrioles (Removal of p53 allowed human cells to proliferate indefinitely despite the absence of centrioles (Overexpression of Plk4 did not promote de novo centriole formation in acentriolar mouse zygotes (De novo centrioles assembled very efficiently (within two to three cell cycles) after restoration of Plk4 levels (A single centriole was shown to suppress de novo centriole assembly in the vast majority of cells, supporting the conclusion that existing centrioles inhibit the de novo assembly pathway (Fig. S5 E; </chapter><chapter title="Materials and methods">A C-terminal Plk4 fragment (aa 510&#8211;970) was cloned into a pET-23b bacterial expression vector (EMD Millipore) containing a C-terminal 6xHis tag.

It has also become clear from studies on cut nerves that, perhaps surprisingly, Schwann cells themselves have the ability to turn against their own myelin and initiate myelin breakdown, in addition to being able to call on macrophages for myelin phagocytosis (In spite of the central position of myelin breakdown in Schwann cell biology and pathology, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that make Schwann cell&#8211;mediated myelin digestion possible have not been established. While earlier authors were often cautious about myelin breakdown mechanisms (Schwann cells possess an unusual degree of phenotypic plasticity, and nerve transection triggers a large-scale transformation of the myelin and nonmyelin (Remak) cells of undisturbed nerves to form the repair (Bungner) Schwann cells of injured nerves (Macroautophagy is an inducible degradation system by which cells break down their own organelles and large macromolecules. Autophagy involves the formation of an isolation membrane that extends around cytoplasmic cargo to form an autophagosome, which transfers cargo to the lysosome for degradation (While it has been understood for a long time that the first phase of myelin digestion in injured nerves is performed by Schwann cells, the cellular mechanism that enables Schwann cells to destroy their own myelin has not been established. Most nerve pathology involves breakdown of the myelin sheath, although demyelination occurs most acutely after injury, as part of the cellular reprogramming from myelin cells to repair cells. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of Schwann cell&#8211;mediated demyelination in injured nerves potentially has broader implications. Here, we present evidence that autophagy, a mechanism by which many cells digest their intrinsic cellular components, plays a central role in Schwann cell myelin breakdown. We show that nerve injury triggers strong activation of Schwann cell autophagy, find myelin debris in autophagosomes, and demonstrate a strong requirement for autophagy in myelin digestion, revealing a novel form of selective autophagy of the myelin sheath, myelinophagy.</chapter><chapter title="Results">Transcriptional regulation of autophagy-related genes coincides with autophagy induction in several systems (Fluctuations in levels of lipidated LC3 (LC3 II) are frequently used to determine autophagy induction (To show that autophagy was induced specifically in demyelinating Schwann cells, we used mice expressing a GFP-tagged LC3 transgene, a model widely used to monitor autophagy in vivo (Uninjured myelinated fibers from these mice contained few or no GFP-LC3 punctate structures. In contrast, numerous GFP-LC3 puncta, representing autophagosomes (To confirm that the Schwann cell autophagy machinery is selectively targeted to myelin during active digestion, electron microscopy of cultured nerve segments and Schwann cell cultures were performed. We found myelin debris clearly enclosed in double membrane vesicles typical of autophagosomes (If Schwann cells degrade myelin by autophagy, autophagy inhibitors should reduce myelin breakdown. We therefore cultured nerve segments with the widely used autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and Bafilomycin A1 (Lipids constitute 70&#8211;80% of peripheral myelin (Finally, we examined the effects of pharmacological inhibition of autophagy specifically in demyelinating Schwann cells, using dissociated cell cultures. We found that inhibition of autophagy led to a notable reduction in myelin protein and lipid breakdown (These results show that in injured nerves, Schwann cell autophagy is a major contributor to degradation of myelin proteins and lipids and to the collapse of myelin architecture.The results above (The mutant mice were born and survived normally. Notably, the uninjured adult peripheral nerves of Atg7 conditional knockout (cKO) mice were indistinguishable from wild-type (WT) control littermates. Sensorimotor function, histological appearance, G ratio, the levels of myelin proteins, and lipid composition were all normal (Fig. S3, D&#8211;G; see, however, Nerve homogenates from uninjured and injured ATG7 cKO mice showed strongly reduced ATG7, ATG5-ATG12, and LC3 II in uninjured and cut nerves, indicating impairment of autophagy. The residual proteins are likely to be expressed by cells other than Schwann cells present in the nerve (Striking differences were found when myelin breakdown was compared in Atg7 cKO and WT nerves after injury. A significant reduction was seen in injury-induced breakdown of myelin proteins in transected nerves in vivo (Next, we analyzed whether myelin lipid degradation was also affected in cut nerves from the Atg7 cKO mice. Using FluoroMyelin histochemistry, we found that degradation of myelin lipid was reduced in Atg7 cKO nerves (After injury, myelin and nonmyelin (Remak) Schwann cells undergo a c-Jun&#8211;dependent reprogramming to form repair Schwann cells (These data indicate that activation of autophagy is part of the normal generation of repair Schwann cells after injury.Because the control of myelin breakdown is a central issue in nerve injury and pathology, we studied the regulation of myelinophagy, examining the mTOR and JNK/c-Jun pathways, a mouse model of demyelinating neuropathy, and autophagy in the injured CNS.In starvation autophagy, the best-studied model of autophagy regulation, autophagy is activated by reduction in the activity of the autophagy inhibitor mTOR (In contrast, two alternative autophagy inducers reported to function through mTOR-independent pathways, lithium (LiCl) and ceramide (Ceramide has been proposed to act via the JNK/c-Jun pathway to promote autophagy (Previously, we showed aberrant up-regulation of Schwann cell c-Jun in human demyelinating neuropathies and in the C3 mouse model of the most common hereditary demyelinating neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT1A; Poor axonal regeneration in the CNS is in large part caused by the inability of oligodendrocytes to break down myelin effectively (</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">Myelin destruction in injured nerves has long been recognized to take place in two phases: initially, myelin breakdown by the Schwann cells themselves, followed by myelin phagocytosis performed mostly by hematogenous macrophages (Autophagy-associated genes and autophagic flux were strikingly induced in transected nerves, and myelin-containing double-membrane autophagosomes were found in demyelinating Schwann cells. Genetic inhibition of autophagy inhibited myelin protein and lipid breakdown in injured nerves, and similar results were obtained with pharmacological autophagy inhibitors. When the bulk of myelin breakdown was accomplished, Schwann cells down-regulated autophagy, and myelin-negative cells were largely negative for GFP-LC3 autophagosomes, indicating a cell-autonomous mechanism for reduction of autophagy once myelin is digested. Collectively, these observations indicate that after injury of peripheral nerves, myelin proteins and lipids are selectively targeted for degradation by activation of myelin autophagy in Schwann cells.This injury-induced Schwann cell myelinophagy is mTOR-independent. Namely, it is not activated by suppression of mTOR, the classical mechanism for autophagy activation, as we found that mTOR was activated, rather than suppressed, in transected nerves (Our data show that activation of autophagy is an important component of the reprogramming of Schwann cells that is triggered by nerve cut (The JNK1/c-Jun pathway stimulates autophagy in several cell types, and ceramide stimulates autophagy in part by activating this pathway (Myelin breakdown in the CNS is ineffective. In line with this, we found a marked difference between the injured optic and sciatic nerves, as LC3 II levels, a key indicator of autophagy, were not significantly elevated in the injured optic nerve in contrast to the sciatic. It is intriguing that elevation of c-Jun in cut optic nerves is also minimal relative to that seen in Schwann cells (In conclusion, we have identified myelinophagy as a major mechanism for Schwann cell&#8211;mediated myelin breakdown in injured nerves. We also provide evidence that myelin autophagy is aberrantly regulated in demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, and defective in CNS glia after injury. Identifying an endogenous Schwann cell mechanism for the myelin breakdown that takes place when nerves are cut has broader implications, since activation of autophagy can now be considered to be a plausible candidate mechanism for myelin breakdown in other situations. This includes acquired and inherited demyelinating disease and the age-related degeneration of myelin. Therefore, the recognition of this mechanism in Schwann cells potentially provides novel targets for manipulating demyelination in injury and disease. It also throws new light on the remarkable absence of myelin breakdown by oligodendrocytes. It would be important in future studies to test whether modulation of myelinophagy improves repair in both the injured peripheral nervous system and CNS, and prevents myelin breakdown in demyelinating neuropathies.</chapter><chapter title="Materials and methods">Animal experiments conformed to UK Home Office guidelines under the supervision of UCL Biological Services, and to the Spanish/European regulations on animal use under the supervision of the institutional committee at CIC bioGUNE (AAALAC-accredited facility) and the Instituto de Neurociencias de Alicante.These mice were crossed with DNA for genotyping was extracted from ear or tail samples using the Hot Sodium Hydroxide and Tris method (HotSHot; Primers for genotyping Atg7We used three models to study Schwann cell myelin breakdown in response to nerve injury. (1) After nerve transection (6&#8211;8 wk old mice), which results in axonal degeneration, the distal stump was most commonly cut into further 2&#8211;3-mm segments and left in situ, most commonly for 3&#8211;5 d, before examination.

In brief, cells or nerve segments were fixed in fixative solution (2.5% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, overnight at 4&#176;C), and then osmicated in 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide (added to increase membrane resolution) for 45 min at 4&#176;C. This was followed by standard EM protocol and visualization.RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen), and its concentration and integrity were determined. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies). Ct values were normalized to the housekeeping expression (Nerves (3 mg) from five WT and five Atg7 cKO mice (uncut and cut nerves) were homogenized in ice-cold PBS and lipids were extracted from homogenates as described previously (The lipid extracts were separated by thin layer chromatography and quantified by optical densitometry as detailed previously (Myelin was purified from uncut and 5 d cut sciatic nerve extracts by density gradient centrifugation, based on previously published protocols (Lipid profiling of purified myelin fractions from control and cut nerves from three WT and three cKO mice were performed at OWL Metabolomics. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography/electrospray/mass spectrometry&#8211;based platforms were used for optimal profiling of glycerolipids, cholesteryl esters, sphingolipids, and glycerophospholipids as described previously (Protein from five WT and five cKO samples (both uncut and cut nerves) was extracted in a buffer containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, and 4% CHAPS. After in-solution tryptic digestion, peptide mixtures obtained from the digestions were separated by on-line NanoLC (nLC) and analyzed using electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Peptide separation was performed on a nanoACQUITY UPLC system (Waters) connected to a mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap XL ETD; Thermo Fisher Scientific).Progenesis LC-MS software (Nonlinear Dynamics) was used for differential protein expression analysis. Raw files were imported into the program, and one of the samples was selected as a reference run to which the precursor masses in all the other samples were aligned. Abundance ratios between the run to be aligned and the reference run were calculated for all features at given retention times. These values were then logarithmized and the software, based on the analysis of the distribution of all ratios, automatically calculated a global scaling factor. Once normalized, samples were grouped in the corresponding experimental category and compared. Differences between groups were only considered for peptide abundances with an ANOVA p-value &lt;0.05 and a ratio &gt;1.5 in either direction. A peak list containing the differential peptides was generated for each comparison, and searched against a database using the Mascot Search engine (Nerves from surgical transection or cultured nerve segments were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and transferred to tubes containing 10&#8211;12 10B lysing matrix beads and 100 &#181;l of lysis buffer (5 M urea, 2.5% SDS, 50 mM Tris, and 30 mM NaCl). Samples were placed in a Fastprep homogenizer for 45 s at level 6, chilled on ice, and then subjected to a repeat homogenization at the same setting. Lysates were then centrifuged at 4&#176;C at 10,000 rpm for 2 min. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes and centrifuged again at the same settings. New supernatants were collected and stored at &#8722;80&#176;C.Cultured Schwann cells were extracted by cell scraping. Cells on 35-mm tissue culture dishes were washed twice with PBS before addition of 100 &#181;l of lysis buffer (T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were scraped with a plastic cell lifter and the lysate was collected. Lysates were then centrifuged at 4&#176;C at 10,000 rpm for 2 min. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes and centrifuged again at the same settings. New supernatants were collected and stored at &#8722;80&#176;C.Between 5 &#181;g and 40 &#181;g of protein samples were loaded onto acrylamide gels and run alongside prestained standard molecular weight markers (PageRuler prestained protein ladder; Thermo Fisher Scientific) to enable identification of band sizes. Gels were run using the mini Protean II gel electrophoresis apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond ECL; Amersham Biosciences) or PVDF (Immobilon-P; EMD Millipore) membranes using the Bio-Rad Laboratories semi-dry system.Membranes were blocked in 5% fat-free milk powder (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 1 h (at room temperature) and subsequently incubated overnight at 4&#176;C in primary antibodies diluted in 5% milk/PBS on a slow rotator (Gallenkamp). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2,000) were used (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and membranes were developed with ECL reagent (GE Healthcare). Experiments were repeated at least three times with fresh samples and representative pictures are shown. Densitometric quantification of Western blots was performed using ImageJ analysis software or Image Lab 4.1 (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The measurements were normalized to loading controls (GAPDH or &#946;-Actin), and for each experiment, at least three different biological replicates were used.All experiments were performed according to UK Home Office guidelines. Four mice from each genotype were tested and at least three measurements from each mouse were taken to obtain mean values.Mice walked along a wooden beam 1 m long, 20 cm high, and 0.5 cm wide to assess sensorimotor function. Foot slips and beam falls were counted over the middle distance of 70 cm. A performance score was given as follows: 0 and 1 foot slips = a score of 1; 2&#8211;5 foot slips = a score of 2; &gt;5 foot slips or at least 1 beam fall = a score of 3. Mice were first accustomed to the beam in training sessions on two days that included walking on wider beams of 2 cm and 1.2 cm. At the end of the second day, mice were scored on the 0.5 cm beam.Paw prints were taken from 6-wk-old mice to calculate the SFI. The SFI formula correlates mouse paw prints with nerve function, as described previously (Masking tape was placed around the perimeter of a cage lid. Mice were placed individually on top of the lid, which was then slowly turned around with the mouse hanging on upside down by all four legs. Mice were allowed to hang for 2 min. Latency until fall was noted, unless mice remained on the lid for the full 2 min.Net LC3 II flux was calculated by analyzing LC3 II turnover by Western blotting in the presence or absence of lysosomal inhibitors. In brief, net LC3 II flux was calculated by subtracting the densitometry value of normalized (relative to GAPDH) LC3 II in the sample treated with lysosomal inhibitor by the value in the control sample (untreated). A minimum of three biological replicate experiments were performed for net LC3 II flux calculations.Values are given as means &#177; SEM (Fig. S1 shows qPCR analysis of autophagy-related genes from </chapter><chapter title="Supplementary Material" /></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4494003"><title>Interphase centrosome organization by the PLP-Cnn scaffold is required for centrosome function</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>The Journal of Cell Biology</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Dorothy A.</first-name><last-name>Lerit</last-name></author><author><first-name>Holly A.</first-name><last-name>Jordan</last-name></author><author><first-name>John S.</first-name><last-name>Poulton</last-name></author><author><first-name>Carey J.</first-name><last-name>Fagerstrom</last-name></author><author><first-name>Brian J.</first-name><last-name>Galletta</last-name></author><author><first-name>Mark</first-name><last-name>Peifer</last-name></author><author><first-name>Nasser M.</first-name><last-name>Rusan</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Research Articles</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Introduction">Centrosomes are composed of a pair of centrioles embedded in pericentriolar material (PCM) and function as microtubule (MT) organizing centers (MTOCs; Super-resolution microscopy has revised our view of PCM from an amorphous cloud to a structured architecture (One question that emerges from the discovery of the PCM organization is the identification of the molecular glue, or scaffold, that holds the structure together. A centrosome scaffold was first proposed upon resolving Pcnt and &#947;-Tubulin (&#947;Tub) to a reticular, tubelike lattice (In humans, mutations in Pcnt and the Cnn orthologue, Cdk5rap2/Cep215, are associated with microcephaly (We use live imaging and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to detail a cell cycle&#8211;dependent reorganization of the embryo centrosome, where PCM is expanded during interphase and compact during mitosis. We identify interphase-specific PLP satellites, novel structures that localize exclusively to the tips of Cnn flares. Furthermore, we show a Cnn and PLP direct interaction at two domains. Mutant analysis supports a role for PLP in coordinating the cell cycle&#8211;dependent rearrangement of the Cnn scaffold that is essential for normal centrosome function. Our data indicate that proper interphase centrosome organization by the PLP-Cnn scaffold is required for centrosome separation, mitotic progression, genome stability, and embryonic viability.</chapter><chapter title="Results">Centrosome composition, organization, and activity undergo striking cell cycle oscillations (To study Cnn during the rapid early divisions, it is critical to precisely track the timing of its reorganization. By imaging recombineered Cnn in embryos coexpressing the nuclear marker H2A-RFP, we find that Cnn is a compact structure during mitosis (To observe the mitotic-to-interphase transition of Cnn in finer detail, we imaged embryos with greater temporal resolution. Unexpectedly, the compact mitotic centrosome gradually appears to unfurl as flares seemingly unfold and extend from the center mass (Recent studies using SIM to define the PCM structure in cultured cells revealed that the ostensibly amorphous PCM is, indeed, organized into zones (As expected, we found that the distributions of centriole proteins, such as SAS6 and Asterless (Asl), remain constant in mitosis and interphase (Reasoning that factors enriched in the interphase flare zone might regulate or contribute to Cnn scaffold function, we assayed the localization of many other centrosome proteins (The defining molecule of the PCM zone, &#947;Tub, is found at low levels in the interphase flare zone (In contrast, we find endogenous PLP at high levels in nearly every Cnn flare (94.7%; PLP satellites are found at the tips of Cnn flares (To investigate the function of PLP satellites in detail, we examined live embryos expressing full-length PLP-GFP (PLPImaging individual embryos progressing from NC 10 or 11 (early blastoderm) through NC 14 (cellularization) reveals that PLPTo examine PLP satellite dynamics in detail, we imaged PLPA model where a PLP&#8211;Cnn complex can assemble into a stable scaffold is supported by experiments that show that overexpression of either mammalian Cep215 or Pcnt is sufficient to form a super scaffold that recruits high levels of the other (Given these coordinated movements, we sought to test if Cnn flare extension is required for PLP satellite formation. Previous studies show that treatment with the MT drug colchicine causes Cnn flares to collapse into a compact, mitotic-like configuration (To date, a functional role for PLP has not been examined in the To quantify these abnormalities, we imaged endogenous Cnn in Our analysis also revealed a significant ninefold increase in cytoplasmic Cnn particles in interphase Expanded localization of Pcnt to centrosomes has previously been correlated with MT organization in mouse epithelial cells (Given this MT disorganization, we reasoned that centrosome separation, a process known to require properly arranged anti-parallel MTs, would be impaired.

Immunoprecipitation experiments from mammalian and The power of Notably, PLPThese data raise the intriguing possibility that the second interaction defined between Cnn CM2 and PLP-F2 may be important for the normal formation of Cnn flares and PLP satellites in interphase. Unfortunately, despite testing 16 truncations of PLP-F2, our efforts to narrow the interaction region were unsuccessful (Despite producing normal levels of Cnn protein, prior detailed analysis of SIM confirms that interphase centrosomes in </chapter><chapter title="Discussion">Our identification of a positive feedback loop between Cnn and PLP that coordinates the cell cycle&#8211;dependent reorganization of the centrosome structure adds to the growing recognition that the centrosome is subject to sophisticated layers of regulation to ensure proper function. The interdependence of three major PCM components (Pcnt/PLP, Cep215/Cnn, and Cep192/Spd2) and two kinases (Plk1/Polo and Aurora A) in generating a fully functional mitotic centrosome is well established (for a recent review see Interestingly, our imaging of Cnn during mitotic exit is highly suggestive of Cnn forming a reticular, strand-like structure that is compact in mitosis, but unravels as the cell enters interphase to form a giant centrosome with constitutive MTOC activity. The mechanisms that control these Cnn dynamic movements will require further studies, including the use of fluorescence photoconversion methods. What mediates this cell cycle&#8211;dependent transition in centrosome architecture? One compelling candidate is Polo, which is known to phosphorylate Cnn and promote its lattice formation (Moreover, we uncovered PLP localized to the tip of each Cnn flare. These PLP satellites are distinct from a PCM pool of PLP predicted by FRAP analysis of PACT-GFP (a GFP fusion with a motif from the C terminus of PLP; Several recent studies support a model of Cnn scaffold formation in Although related, the two scaffolds are likely functionally unique. The Spd2&#8211;Cnn scaffold is the main anchor of &#947;Tub within the PCM zone, whereas the PLP&#8211;Cnn scaffold functions to anchor Cnn within the flare zone, effectively preventing interphase centrosome dematuration by resisting MT-dependent particle release forces (Our Y2H studies show that PLP and Cnn likely interact at two defined domains. Analysis of PLPPrevious work on the regulation of Cnn by Polo and Spd2, combined with our functional analysis of direct interactions with PLP, paints a complex portrait of the Cnn molecule. We propose that the coregulation of PLP satellites and Cnn flares is required for their anchorage to the centrosome, preventing interphase centrosome inactivation, and maintaining robust MT asters throughout the cell cycle. Disruption of this interphase PLP&#8211;Cnn scaffold leads to increased cytoplasmic PCM particles that act as platforms for MTs, leading to the formation of an aberrant interphase MT array in the embryo. These effects on MTs then cause defects in centrosome separation, nuclear spacing, and spindle assembly, culminating in chromosome missegregation, DNA damage, and embryonic lethality. Together, our data emphasize the fundamental importance of regulating interphase centrosome form and function for viability.</chapter><chapter title="Materials and methods">The following mutant strains and transgenic lines were used: the All transgenic flies were generated by BestGene, Inc., using standard P-element transformation.

Laser excitation was supplied by a laser merge module equipped with 491 nm, 561 nm, and 642 nm solid-state lasers (VisiTech International). For super-resolution SIM, immuno-labeled samples were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and imaged with the DeltaVision OMX4 SIM Imaging System (Applied Precision).Embryos (1&#8211;2 h old) were prepared for live imaging as described previously (Total fluorescence intensity projections of the entire centrosome/centriole volume were used to measure the peak (P) and outer edge (OE) position of Sas6, Asl, and PLP, and the OE position of &#947;Tub and Cnn. Single optical sections through the middle of the centrosome were used for P measurements of &#947;Tub and Cnn. All line scans were single-pixel-wide line scans of 5 &#181;m generated by the Plot Profile tool in ImageJ. Line scans were converted to a &#8722;2.50 to 2.50 scale such that the 0.0 &#181;m position marked the center of the centriole. Average background fluorescence was subtracted from each pixel along the line scan. GraphPad Software was then used to fit each line scan to a Gaussian curve from which the mean (&#956;) and SD (Gaussian RMS) was calculated. &#956; represents the position of the Gaussian peak (P), which is the peak fluorescence intensity.

The mean P and OE for each measured centrosome protein is reported in Fig. S1 A. For Sas6, the entire &#8722;2.5 to 2.5 line scan was used to fit the Gaussian curve, for all other proteins two independent curves were generated along the &#8722;2.5 to 0.0 and 0.0 to 2.5 positions.

They are formed by the non-covalent interaction of &#945;- and &#946;-tubulin heterodimers. MTs are nucleated at MT organizing centers (MTOCs) by a &#947;-tubulin&#8211;containing complex that acts as a MT template. As a MTOC stays attached to MT, it stabilizes the so-called MT minus end (Fission yeast has proven to be a powerful model to study how different MT structures are constructed all along the cell cycle (Interphase MT bundles are composed of about four dynamic antiparallel MTs (Interphase MT bundles have an additional physiological function. Just after division, cells initiate growth at the preexisting cell end, the old end. Dynamic interphase MTs play an active role in this process. Indeed, by touching the cell cortex, growing MT plus ends deliver polarity factors to cell extremity. One of these factors, the Kelch repeat&#8211;containing protein Tea1, docks onto its membrane-associated receptor, the prenylated protein Mod5 (Like other eukaryotes, upon nutrient exhaustion, In this study, we show that fission yeast cytoskeletons are completely reorganized upon quiescence entry. Indeed, we primarily observed that the MT cytoskeleton is drastically reshaped as quiescent cells assemble a large SPB-associated MT bundle composed of astonishingly stable antiparallel MTs. Importantly, we also report that quiescence establishment comes along with a massive rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and the loss of cell polarity. We finally demonstrate that quiescent cell MT elongation is strictly required for cell polarity reestablishment upon quiescence exit.</chapter><chapter title="Results">Upon carbon source exhaustion, fission yeast cells leave the cell cycle and enter quiescence from interphase (In interphase cells, cytoplasmic MTs are known to be extremely dynamic as they rapidly alternate periods of growth and shrinkage (Tubulin binds GTP and can hydrolyze this nucleotide. The influence of the tubulin nucleotide status on MT dynamics in vivo is still a mater of debate (Kinetic analysis of MT stabilization upon entry into quiescence after carbon exhaustion revealed that as early as 6 h after glucose depletion the MT bundle linked to the SPB was more stable, i.e., resistant to the MT-destabilizing drug benomyl, than other MT bundles present in the cell (To get insights into the mechanism of Q-MT bundle formation, we looked for MAPs colocalizing with this structure. First, we found that astonishingly, in quiescent cells, Mto1 and Mto2 were no longer found as dots around the nuclear envelope but rather localized exclusively onto the Q-MT bundle (We then analyzed the effect of MAP encoding gene deletion on the Q-MT bundle shape, stability, and formation. None of the deletions tested resulted in the absence of MT bundle (In our experimental conditions, glucose exhaustion is responsible for cell entry into quiescence (We then wonder whether, upon quiescence exit, Q-MT bundle elongation was caused by the polymerization of free cytoplasmic tubulin or if it required the depolymerization of the MTs embedded into the Q-MT bundle. Cell treatment with both CHX and TBZ revealed that within the first 30 min after cell refeeding neither the fluorescence nor the length of the quiescent cell Q-MT bundle was affected (In actively dividing Upon quiescence exit, we found that cells rapidly repolarized. Indeed, within minutes, Tea1 returned to the cell tips (To decipher the potential role of the Q-MT bundle in cell repolarization upon quiescence exit, cells exiting quiescence were treated with MBC, a drug that prevents MT bundle elongation and de novo interphase MT bundle formation at the nuclear periphery (Interestingly, we found that quiescent To definitively address this point, we used </chapter><chapter title="Discussion">In this study we have shown that when fission yeast cells enter quiescence after carbon source exhaustion, they remodel their MT cytoskeleton into a unique MT bundle (Q-MT bundle). This Q-MT bundle is composed of more than 15 stable and regularly spaced antiparallel MTs. Importantly, this structure is associated with the SPB, a MTOC that seems to be involved in Q-MT bundle MT stabilization (Upon quiescence establishment, the SBP-associated MT bundle rapidly becomes more stable compared with other MT bundles present in the cell cytoplasm (During proliferation, nearly 100% of the cells display SPB-associated MTs. In quiescence, &#8764;75% of the Q-MT bundles are associated with the SPB (The molecular events leading to MT stabilization within the Q-MT bundle are still unknown. We can speculate that an enhanced MT cross-linking activity specifically associated with the Q-MT bundle may prevent its depolymerization. Upon quiescence entry, the SPB-associated bundle may recruit proteins that will either modify the bundling activity of known MT cross-linkers, such as Ase1, or load quiescence-specific MT bundling proteins that remain to be identified.However, an increased MT bundling activity does not explain why MTs apparently do not elongate. We cannot rule out that residual polymerization/depolymerization cycles occur at the MT plus ends. In this scenario, MT elongation would be undetectable using classic fluorescence microscopy because the equilibrium between growth and shrinkage would be displaced toward depolymerization, for example, through the activation of a MT depolymerase. An alternative possibility could be that upon quiescence entry, a MT plus end &#8220;capper&#8221; would be recruited specifically onto the SPB-associated Q-MT bundle. Although no MT-capping activity has been identified to date, we can envision that a MT plus end tracker, such as a TOG domain&#8211;containing protein, for example, could lock MT plus ends, thereby preventing tubulin addition. Finally, the absence of detectable MT elongation in quiescent cells could result from the lack of free polymerizable tubulin. However, we have clearly shown that a free tubulin pool is present in the quiescent cell cytoplasm. Indeed, upon cell refeeding, the Q-MT bundle elongates, even if the de novo protein synthesis is inhibited (Whatever the mechanism responsible for the absence of MT dynamics in quiescence, Q-MT bundle elongation is rapidly triggered by glucose upon quiescence exit. This swift event, which does not depend on de novo protein synthesis, probably relies on signaling cascades involving nutrient catabolism (Importantly, we have demonstrated that Q-MT bundle elongation and the recovery of MT dynamics is necessary for an efficient quiescence exit (We have previously shown that when budding yeast cells enter quiescence after glucose exhaustion, they assemble a stable MT bundle emanating from the SPB (All quiescent cells need to preserve their ability to proliferate and must produce a healthy progeny (Nevertheless, here, we have uncovered a physiological function for a quiescent cell&#8211;specific structure, as we have shown that fission yeast Q-MT bundle elongation is mandatory for an efficient quiescence exit.

Cilia consist of three different compartments&#8212;the basal body (BB), the transition zone (TZ), and the axoneme. The BB is a modified centriole from which the ciliary microtubule-based framework, the axoneme, grows out. The intermediate region between the BB and the axoneme is called the TZ. Mutations in the gene Protein degradation is an essential process to ensure proper cellular signaling and hence a normal development of an organism (Interestingly, a link between primary cilia and the autophagy&#8211;lysosome system, another protein degradation mechanism, has been found (Analyzing the molecular background of ciliopathies based on Rpgrip1l deficiency in this study, we uncovered that Rpgrip1l regulates proteasomal activity. However, it does not control total cellular proteasomal activity per se but exclusively at primary cilia. Our data reveal the localization of proteasomal components at the ciliary base and a decreased activity of the ciliary proteasome in the absence of Rpgrip1l. We show that Rpgrip1l interacts with Psmd2, a proteasomal 19S subunit component, at the ciliary TZ. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that Rpgrip1l realizes the regulation of proteasomal activity at the ciliary base via Psmd2.</chapter><chapter title="Results">Originally, Rpgrip1l has been shown to be a BB protein (The absence of particular TZ proteins results in differences in ciliary length (The observations of significant elongation of cilia in our in vitro and in vivo model systems led us to the question if ciliary signaling is affected in these systems. Previously, we found an elevated Gli3-190/Gli3-83 ratio in If proteasomal degradation occurs at the ciliary base, ubiquitinated proteins should accumulate there. We used an antibody specifically recognizing an epitope of ubiquitin proteins and detected an accumulation at cilia of WT MEFs. In Based on these observations, it appears that Rpgrip1l regulates proteasomal activity in a cilia-dependent manner. Because Rpgrip1l localizes to the ciliary TZ, it is possible that it controls proteasomal activity directly at primary cilia. To our knowledge, the existence of a ciliary proteasome (a proteasome that localizes and functions at cilia) has been assumed (A prerequisite for a proteasome to function at the base of cilia is the presence of components of the 19S and 20S proteasomal subunits. Psmd2, Psmd3, and Psmd4, which are components of the 19S proteasomal subunit, are found at the BB of WT MEF cilia by using 3D-SIM (It has been reported that inhibition of the proteasome leads to an accumulation of proteasomal subunits at the centrosome (To unravel how Rpgrip1l regulates the activity of the proteasome, we searched for novel interaction partners of Rpgrip1l by performing a yeast two-hybrid screen. Among a total of six proteins, we found Psmd2 as a potential interaction partner (Fig. S1 C). We used the tagged RPGR-interacting domain (RID) of Rpgrip1l (the full-length Rpgrip1l could not be stably expressed) and a tagged full-length Psmd2 for transient overexpression in NIH3T3 and HEK293T cells. Using coimmunoprecipitation and tandem affinity purification assays, we confirmed the interaction of Rpgrip1l with Psmd2 (Proteasomes have been detected in the nucleus, in the microsomes, in the cytosol, at the centrosomes and at the base of cilia (Because in MEFs, the interaction of Rpgrip1l and Psmd2 seems to take place only at the ciliary TZ, but Rpgrip1l is also located at centrosomes during mitosis, the question arises whether Rpgrip1l also regulates the activity of the centrosomal proteasome. Proteasomal degradation at the centrosome has previously been reported for ubiquitinated proteins (Because Psmd2 is a 19S proteasomal subunit, and hence, Rpgrip1l may have only a direct regulatory impact on the 19S subunit, it could be possible that a drug-induced activation of the 20S proteasomal subunit leads to an increase of proteasomal activity in However, ciliary length is not recovered in </chapter><chapter title="Discussion">Mutations in the gene In the Recently, it was shown that the ciliopathy-associated proteins Bbs4 and Ofd1 are essential for the proteasomal degradation or processing of proteins involved in paracrine signaling (Interestingly, Bbs4 recruitment is disturbed in autophagy-deficient cells (A potential association of Rpgrip1l with proteasomal activity has been found before. According to our data, a decreased activity of the ciliary proteasome is a potential cause of ciliopathies. Thus, it will be indispensable to uncover the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the ciliary proteasome by Rpgrip1l. The outcome of these future studies could be the prerequisite for new therapies to treat ciliopathies. In this context, treatment of Formerly, an association between proteasomal degradation and the intraflagellar transport was suggested (It was reported in a previous study that proteasomal dysfunction is only one contributor to the pathology of ciliopathies (</chapter><chapter title="Materials and methods">All mice (We used We used the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-actin (A2066; Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-FLAG (200472; Agilent Technologies), mouse anti-Gapdh (G8795; Sigma-Aldrich), goat anti-Gli3 (AF3690; R&amp;D systems), mouse anti-HA (MMS-101P; Covance), rabbit anti-Hprt (ab10479; Abcam), rabbit anti-Myc (sc-789; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit anti-phospho-(S33/37/T41)-&#946;-Catenin (9561; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti&#8211;nonphospho-(S33/37/T41)-&#946;-Catenin (4270; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-Psma5 (PA1-1962; Thermo Fisher Scientific), mouse anti-Pcnt (611814; BD), goat anti-Pcnt2 (sc-28145; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), goat anti-Psmd2 (IMG-3751; Imgenex), rabbit anti-Psmd3 (S2824; Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-Psmd4 (14899-1-AP; Proteintech), rabbit anti-Smo (ab72130; Abcam), mouse anti&#8211;acetylated &#945;-tubulin (T6793; Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti&#8211;&#947;-tubulin (T6557; Sigma-Aldrich), and rabbit anti-Ubiquitin (U5379; Sigma-Aldrich). The antibodies to Cep290 as well as Nphp4 are gifts provided by S. Saunier (Institut National de la Sant&#233; et de la Recherche M&#233;dicale, Universit&#233; Paris Descartes, Paris, France). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against Cep290 was generated against the murine sequence (amino acids 330&#8211;360 and amino acids 700&#8211;735). The anti-Nphp4 antibody was raised in rabbits by injection of a recombinant His-tagged human Nphp4 fragment (amino acids 673&#8211;1,032). The antibody against Evc is a gift provided by R. Rohatgi (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA). The rabbit anti-Evc antibody was generated against the mouse sequence (amino acids 461&#8211;1,005). The polyclonal antibody against Rpgrip1l was generated by immunizing rabbits with a GST-Rpgrip1l fusion protein encompassing the murine Rpgrip1l-RID domain (amino acids 1,060&#8211;1,264) by Pineda antibody services. The polyclonal antibody against Gli3-190 was generated by immunizing rabbits with a His-Gli3 fusion protein encompassing the mouse Gli3-C terminal region (3,473&#8211;4,806 bp) by Pineda antibody services. Antibodies were affinity purified with the antigen coupled to Ni-NTA agarose (QIAGEN). Antibody specificity is confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses (MEFs were isolated from single E12.5 embryos after performing standard procedures. The transfection of MEFs, NIH3T3 and HEK293T cells with the particular constructs used in different experiments was performed by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The RID domain of murine Rpgrip1l (aa 1,076&#8211;1,264) was cloned into the Flag-tagged pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) and expressed under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promotor. Murine full-length Wnk2 was cloned into the Myc-tagged pCMV vector (Takara Bio Inc.). Both plasmids were separately transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Each transfection experiment has been repeated once.Cells were treated for 6 h with 20 &#181;M MG132 (ALX-260-092; Enzo Life Sciences) or for 20 h with 5 &#181;M SFN (ALX-350-230-M010; Enzo Life Sciences). As a solvent control, cells were treated for the same time with 0.1% DMSO, respectively. To stimulate Shh signaling, cells were treated for 24 h with 200 nM SAG (EMD Millipore). To ensure ciliary absence in the in situ PLA experiment (Fig. S1 E), MEFs were treated with 10 &#181;g/ml nocodazole (M1404; Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 3 h in 4&#176;C. All treatment experiments were repeated once.Tagged Psmd2 full-length protein and the RID domain of Rpgrip1l were transiently overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells. After 24 h of expression, cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, and 0.25% Na-deoxycholate) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich). Lysates were precleared with protein G&#8211;agarose (EMD Millipore) overnight followed by an overnight incubation with anti-FLAG or anti-Myc protein G&#8211;agarose. Afterward, beads with bound protein complexes were washed in lysis buffer, taken up in 4&#215; sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, glycerol, 2% SDS, 20% &#946;-mercaptoethanol, and bromophenol blue), and heated for 10 min at 95&#176;C. Beads were precipitated by centrifugation. Supernatant was run on a SDS-PAGE gel and then immunoblotted. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were repeated three times.Embryos were fixed in 4% PFA and incubated in 30% sucrose (in PBS) overnight at 4&#176;C. On the following day, they were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (Miles Laboratories, Inc.) and then stored at &#8722;80&#176;C. Transverse cryostat sections (7 &#181;m in thickness) were prepared.All solutions were preheated to 37&#176;C, and isolation was performed at this temperature. Embryos at the embryonic stage E12.5 were isolated at 37&#176;C retaining the connection between embryo and placenta, respectively (Image acquisition and data analysis were performed at room temperature using a microscope (Imager.A2; Carl Zeiss), 100&#215;, NA 1.46 oil immersion objective lens (Carl Zeiss), a monochrome charge-coupled device camera (AxioCam MRm; Carl Zeiss), and the AxioVision Rel. 4.8 software package (Carl Zeiss).3D-SIM was performed on a ELYRA PS.1 system (Carl Zeiss) equipped with an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (iXON DU-885; Andor Technology) with 1,004 &#215; 1,002 pixels at room temperature. Z stacks were taken using a 100&#215; &#945;-Plan Apochromat oil immersion objective with an NA of 1.46. To generate structured illumination, a grid pattern is projected onto the image plane in five different positions and at five different modulation angles to obtain high frequency information within the low frequency information captured by the optical system. For the Dylight405-, Dylight488-, Cy3-channel back computation of the lower frequencies, Fourier transformation was performed using the ZEN Structured Illumination Processing tool (Carl Zeiss) to increase the resolution in the final image. Fluorochromes used were Dylight405, Dylight488, Cy3, DAPI, EGFP, and ZsGreen.For immunofluorescence on MEFs, cells were plated on coverslips, and after reaching confluency, they were serum starved for &#8805;24 h. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA (for stainings with the antibodies to Rpgrip1l, Nphp4, Cep290, phospho-(S33/37/T41)-&#946;-Catenin, Evc, Smo, and Gli3-190), methanol (for stainings with the antibody against Psmd2 and Psmd4), methanol/acetone (for stainings with the antibodies to Ubiquitin and Psmd3), or 4% PFA/methanol (for stainings with the antibody against Psma5), respectively. Fixed cells were rinsed three times with PBS after permeabilization with PBS/0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After three washes with PBS, they were blocked for &#8805;10 min at room temperature in PBST (PBS/0.1% Triton X-100) containing 10% donkey serum. Diluted primary antibodies in block were incubated overnight at 4&#176;C. After three washing steps with PBST, incubation with fluorescent secondary antibody diluted in block was performed at room temperature for 1 h followed by several washings and subsequent embedding with Mowiol optionally containing DAPI (Merck).For immunofluorescence on cryosections, cryosections were washed with PBS and permeabilized with PBS/0.5% Triton X-100. Blocking was performed with 10% FCS in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100. The sections then were incubated with the primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4&#176;C. After three washing steps, they underwent an incubation in the secondary antibody (diluted in blocking solution) for 2 h and then were washed again. Finally, they were embedded in Mowiol containing DAPI (Merck). All immunofluorescence experiments were repeated at least one time.The in situ PLA (PLA or DUOLINK) was performed according to the manufacturer&#8217;s manual (OLink Bioscience) and was used to detect the subcellular localization of the interaction between Rpgrip1l and Psmd2. First, Rpgrip1l and Psmd2 are recognized by specific primary antibodies. Subsequently, PLA probes consisting of species-specific secondary antibodies, each with a unique short DNA strand attached to it, bind to the primary antibodies. The addition of two other circle-forming DNA oligonucleotides leads to an interaction of the DNA strands if Rpgrip1l and Psmd2 are in close proximity (&lt;40 nm). After joining of the two added oligonucleotides by enzymatic ligation, a rolling circle amplification using a polymerase starts. The amplified DNA is visualized by fluorescent-labeled complementary oligonucleotide probes. The cilium in the in situ PLA experiments was marked by the product of a transiently transfected IFT88-EYFP construct (Measurement of proteasomal activity was performed according to Intensity of ciliary protein staining was quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). For quantifications of the axoneme-associated protein Gli3-190, we used the area marked by acetylated &#945;-tubulin and quantified the average pixel intensity to take the cilia length into account thereby making the data of WT and Freshly dissected limbs from E12.5 embryos were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde. After three washes with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, the limbs were broken in liquid nitrogen, dehydrated through a graded series of acetone, and dried chemically using hexamethylsilazane. Samples were then mounted on stubs followed by gold sputter coating. Cilia were imaged using a scanning electron microscope (Leo 1430 VP; Carl Zeiss). The SEM experiment has been repeated once.Figure preparation was performed by using Photoshop 7 or CS4 (Adobe), and collages of the all images for figure preparation were arranged using Illustrator CS4 (Adobe).The activity of the ciliary proteasome was evaluated using WT and An accumulation of the ZsProSensor-1 protein was observed exclusively at the ciliary base of A pool of ON-TARGET plus siRNA against Data are presented as means &#177; SEM. Two-tailed Student&#8217;s HEK293T cells were transfected with constructs that encoded the RID domain of Rpgrip1l fused to FLAG/Strep/HA-tags and that encoded full-length Psmd2 fused to a Myc-tag. After 24 h, transfected cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at 4&#176;C and sedimentated at 10,000 Whole-cell lysates were obtained by lysis with radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (150 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mM EDTA). Protein content was measured by the Bradford method, and samples were normalized. 20 mg of total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE on polyacrylamide gels (10%) and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). The membrane was probed with antibodies against Psmd2, Psmd3, Psma5, Myc, phospho-(S33/37/T41)-&#946;-Catenin, nonphospho-(S33/37/T41)-&#946;-Catenin, HA, or FLAG. Anti-actin, anti-Gapdh, and anti-Hprt antibodies were used as loading controls. Proteins were detected with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (RPN4201 and RPN4301) and the ECL detection kit (both GE Healthcare). Visualization of protein bands was realized by LAS-4000 mini (Fujifilm). Band intensities were measured by using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).The screen was performed by using a Gal4-based yeast two-hybrid system (BD) and a mouse E11.5 cDNA library (BD). As host, the yeast strain AH109 was used, which carried the Fig. S1 shows that the ciliary amount of Smo and Evc is unaltered in </chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4494007"><title>Myelinophagy: Schwann cells dine in</title><article-type>article-commentary</article-type><journal-title>The Journal of Cell Biology</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Michael</first-name><last-name>Thumm</last-name></author><author><first-name>Mikael</first-name><last-name>Simons</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Reviews</category></article-categories><chapters /></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4494008"><title>From cell biology to the microbiome: An intentional infinite loop</title><article-type>other</article-type><journal-title>The Journal of Cell Biology</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Wendy S.</first-name><last-name>Garrett</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>News</category></article-categories><chapters /></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4494010"><title>CENP-C is a blueprint for constitutive centromere&#8211;associated network assembly within human kinetochores</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>The Journal of Cell Biology</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Kerstin</first-name><last-name>Klare</last-name></author><author><first-name>John R.</first-name><last-name>Weir</last-name></author><author><first-name>Federica</first-name><last-name>Basilico</last-name></author><author><first-name>Tomasz</first-name><last-name>Zimniak</last-name></author><author><first-name>Lucia</first-name><last-name>Massimiliano</last-name></author><author><first-name>Nina</first-name><last-name>Ludwigs</last-name></author><author><first-name>Franz</first-name><last-name>Herzog</last-name></author><author><first-name>Andrea</first-name><last-name>Musacchio</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Research Articles</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Introduction">Accurate and timely chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis is essential for cellular and organismal viability. During mitosis, sister chromatids generated upon DNA replication retain cohesion until they are bioriented on the mitotic spindle. Release of sister chromatid cohesion at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition allows the spindle to separate the sister chromatids into two genetically identical daughter cells (Kinetochores mediate the attachment of sister chromatids to spindle microtubules. These large structures, consisting of several copies of &#8764;30 core subunits, become established on a segment of specialized chromatin named the centromere, whose main hallmark is the presence of the histone H3 variant CENP-A (or CenH3; A subset of CCAN subunits, including CENP-N, the CENP-TW complex, and CENP-C, have been recognized as potential &#8220;founders&#8221; of kinetochore assembly downstream of CENP-A (CENP-T and CENP-W are histone fold domain&#8211;containing proteins and form a tightly interacting complex (CENP-C (943 residues in humans) was among the first human centromere proteins to be discovered (The precise localization dependencies of the centromere proximal proteins CENP-C, CENP-N, and CENP-TW are controversial and so is their role in the recruitment of additional CCAN subunits, including those in a four-subunit subcomplex consisting of the CENP-H, CENP-K, CENP-I, and CENP-M subunits (the CENP-HIKM complex), which we have recently characterized (</chapter><chapter title="Results and discussion">We used a protocol previously established in our laboratory (To investigate whether the observed dependency of the CENP-HIKM complex on CENP-C reflected a direct interaction, we built recombinant versions of CENP-HIKM (CENP-CNext, we tried to identify which subunits of the CENP-HIKM complex might be involved in the interaction with CENP-C. To this end, we immobilized a GST&#8211;CENP-CTo further characterize the interaction of CENP-C with CENP-HK, we subjected the CENP-CLow average representation of hydrophobic residues is a defining feature of intrinsically disordered proteins. Within such proteins, however, binding sites for interacting partners often coincide with short stretches of hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids. We noticed that two closely spaced lysine residues (K271 and K273), which were identified as hotspots in the cross-linking experiments, flank a Leu-Phe-Leu motif (residues 265&#8211;267) that appears to be conserved in evolution (To test a possible role of the CENP-C hydrophobic motifs in the interaction with the CENP-HIKM complex, we initially divided the CENP-C PEST region in two separate constructs of approximately similar length (CENP-C residues 189&#8211;290 and 290&#8211;400) each containing only one of the two hydrophobic motifs. As immobilized GST fusion proteins, both CENP-C constructs were sufficient for an interaction with the CENP-HIKM complex in pull-down assays (We therefore tested the effects of mutations in the individual hydrophobic motifs of CENP-C. To this end, we created a triple alanine mutant of residues Leu265, Phe266, and Leu267 (henceforth referred to as &#8220;3A&#8221; mutant) on the GST&#8211;CENP-CWe then combined the mutations (henceforth referred to as &#8220;4A&#8221; mutant) in the context of the GST&#8211;CENP-CWe asked whether the CENP-HIKM binding interface of CENP-C is important for kinetochore localization of CCAN subunits in HeLa cells.

Aurora A activation depends on the autophosphorylation of Thr288 in its activation loop, which occurs primarily at centrosomes (Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in cell proliferation, cell size regulation, transcription, and cytoskeletal regulation in response to a variety of input signals (Here, we have identified a mitotic role for Mio, a highly conserved member of the SEACAT/GATOR2 complex, which regulates Rag-1 and mTOR signaling (</chapter><chapter title="Results">Seh1 is a member of the Nup107 complex that functions in NPC assembly and localizes to kinetochores in mitosis (We confirmed the Mio&#8211;Seh1 interaction using recombinant mCherry-Mio expressed in mammalian cells. Seh1 coimmunoprecipitated with mCherry-Mio protein but not with the mCherry control (Having previously described a requirement for Seh1 for mitotic progression (More detailed live cell imaging of cells stably expressing mRFP-H2B and EGFP&#8211;&#945;-tubulin or EGFP-H2B alone revealed that the kinetics of bipolar spindle formation was abnormal in Mio-depleted cells, although chromosomes eventually aligned on what appeared to be a metaphase plate (The previous observations suggested a potential defect in spindle formation and/or chromosome capture after Mio depletion. However, Mio-depleted cells displayed no obvious defects in kinetochore&#8211;microtubule interactions, checkpoint proteins, or checkpoint bypass, at least as reported by Bub1 and Sgo1 staining and the ability of cells to undergo mitotic arrest in nocodazole (Fig. S2, A&#8211;C). We therefore looked in detail at centrosome-mediated spindle formation.Closer inspection of the distribution of &#945;-tubulin and the centrosomal markers &#947;-tubulin and pericentrin in Mio-depleted cells revealed an increase in several spindle defects. These included abnormal tilt of the spindle axis, disrupted or unfocused spindle poles, monopolar spindles, displacement of the spindle from the cell center toward the cell cortex, and failure of centrosomes to localize at both spindle poles (To measure the orientation of the mitotic spindle in relation to the substratum, 3D image stacks were acquired for Mio-depleted cells grown on fibronectin-coated coverslips. In control RNAi cells grown on these coverslips, the metaphase spindle axis tends to align parallel to the substratum. Although spindle length was normal in Mio-depleted cells (To allow a quantitative measurement of spindle assembly and chromosome alignment, we examined the recovery of Mio-depleted cells from Monastrol, a kinesin Eg5 inhibitor that arrests mitotic cells in prometaphase with monopolar spindles without affecting microtubule dynamics (Micronuclei and lagging chromosomes can occur as a result of kinetochore&#8211;microtubule misattachments, either due to defects in error correction mechanisms, microtubule dynamics, or spindle formation. After observing defects in spindle formation and micronuclei in Mio-depleted cells, we decided to look at kinetochore&#8211;microtubule attachments in detail. We observed no changes in Survivin or Aurora B levels at centromeres of Mio-depleted cells (To characterize the mechanism underlying the various defects in Mio-depleted mitotic cells, we focused on Plk1 and Aurora A. Both of these mitotic kinases have numerous important roles in spindle formation and centrosome separation (Limiting titration of the specific Plk1 inhibitor BI2356 revealed a synthetic interaction with Mio depletion. In Mio-depleted cells, lower concentrations of BI2536 caused a synergistic increase in the percentage of cells with monopolar spindles relative to the same drug treatment of control RNAi cells (Limiting titration of the Aurora A inhibitor MLN8237 also showed a significant, albeit weaker, synthetic interaction (Depletion of Mio had significant effects on the activation of Aurora A and Plk1 at centrosomes. For example, although we observed no changes in total Aurora A localization or the amount on centrosomes and spindles (Protein phosphatase 6 regulates mitotic spindle formation by controlling the T loop phosphorylation of Aurora A bound to its activator TPX2 (Plk1 localization and activity also showed a strong response to Mio depletion. Centrosomal levels of both total Plk1 and active PLK1These results are consistent with the fact that Plk1 is activated at centrosomes during G2 by Aurora A complexed with its cofactor Bora (Both Aurora A and Plk1 are regulatory kinases. We therefore sought to identify downstream effectors that might be responsible for the spindle and mitotic abnormalities observed after Mio depletion and the consequent loss of active Aurora A and Plk1 from centrosomes.One likely target is HURP, whose binding to microtubules is regulated by Aurora A phosphorylation (The distribution of HURP on the spindle was dramatically altered upon Mio depletion. The protein was then evenly distributed throughout the spindle, and the chromosome-proximal characteristic band was lost (This effect of Mio depletion on HURP appears to be quite specific. TPX2 is a partner of HURP in a complex that contributes to Ran-dependent bipolar spindle formation (Localization of a second important Aurora A substrate was also changed after Mio RNAi. MCAK is a microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin that has an essential role in chromosome segregation by controlling kinetochore&#8211;microtubule attachments (The level of centrosomal MCAK was dramatically reduced in cells exposed to Mio RNAi (These effects of Mio depletion were specific for HURP and MCAK and were not a result of a general disruption of the centrosome. It has been suggested that Plk1 activity also contributes to centrosomal localization of the plus end&#8211;directed bipolar kinesin Eg5 before mitotic entry (NuMA, LGN, and the dynein&#8211;dynactin motor complex function at the cell cortex, where they help to generate pulling forces on astral microtubules and direct spindle rotation (Mio is highly conserved from yeast to mammals (We performed rescue experiments to evaluate the importance of the RING/PHD domain in mitotic progression (Mio is a highly conserved member of the SEACAT/GATOR2 complex, antagonizing GATOR1, a known inhibitor of Rag-1 GTPase, and hence promoting mTOR signaling (We next examined phosphorylation of known mTORC1 substrates as a direct measure of mTORC1 activity. Amino acid withdrawal leads to rapid mTORC1 inactivation (If Mio depletion disrupts mitotic progression by inhibiting mTOR, activation of the kinase by an alternative pathway might be expected to at least partially rescue the Mio depletion phenotype. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) dephosphorylates phosphoinositide-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), a potent activator of AKT kinase signaling (To determine by independent method that inhibition of mTOR can explain the mitotic defects observed upon Mio depletion, we developed a protocol that enabled us to inhibit the kinase without blocking cell cycle progression. Rapamycin, when bound to intracellular protein FKBP12, inhibits mTORC1 kinase activity (We conclude that Mio is required for maintenance of active mTOR levels in mitosis.</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">Mio is a component of the SEACAT/GATOR2 complex, which has been reported to be involved in mTOR regulation by the Rag-GTPase (Centrosome separation and bipolar spindle formation both require Plk1 and Aurora A activity. Mio depletion caused a marked reduction of active Aurora AAurora A activates centrosomal Plk1 through phosphorylation of Thr210 (Mio depletion from HeLa cells causes multiple mitotic defects such as a lengthening of the interval between NEBD and anaphase onset, spindle assembly defects including an increase in the number of bipolar monoastral spindles, a prometaphase delay often associated with monopolar spindles, and a delay or failure in cytokinesis. Interestingly, in Aurora A regulates mitotic spindle formation at least partially as part of a multiprotein subunit complex containing HURP, TPX2, and Eg5 kinesin (The kinesin-13 family microtubule depolymerase MCAK associates with centromeres and growing microtubule ends, where it plays a role in correction of kinetochore&#8211;microtubule misattachments from prophase to anaphase. MCAK also localizes to spindle poles, where it is required for the assembly and dynamics of the mitotic spindle. MCAK localization at the centromere and its depolymerase activity are regulated by Aurora B (mTOR plays key roles in several cellular processes through interactions with other proteins to form mTOR complexes 1 and 2 (mTORC1/2). mTORC1 positively regulates cell growth, proliferation, and the cell cycle, whereas mTORC2 plays key roles in cell survival, metabolism, and actin organization (Here, we show for the first time that mTORC1 is an important regulator of mitotic spindle assembly.

Pole to pole measurements were made from single sections of 3D datasets using OMERO.

        I started taking night classes at Oregon Institute of Technology in tiny Klamath Falls. One day, I walked into the dean&#8217;s office unannounced, told her my story, and asked if I could go to school there. She walked me over to the registrar&#8217;s office and told them to admit me. So I was admitted into a four-year school without ever having taken the SAT.I got straight As, and at the end of that year, I transferred to University of Oregon. But I didn&#8217;t really have any sense of what it was like to be in a laboratory. The first person I went to talk to was John Postlethwait, and at the end of our conversation, he said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s start your training next Friday.&#8221;It worked out spectacularly well because zebrafish was really up-and-coming as a model organism and the whole community had been founded in Eugene. That was when I got introduced to developmental biology and I was completely hooked.
        When I got to Didier&#8217;s lab, I became immediately interested in morphogenesis and how cells work collectively to create the shape of an organ. Originally, I was trying to understand how the lumen forms in the primitive gut tube. I was looking at sections under the microscope when I happened to notice an asymmetric pattern of folds in the adjacent tissue of the lateral plate mesoderm. That pattern immediately suggested what the morphogenesis was going to be to push that gut tube over to the left.I think that seeing this pattern was my most magical moment in science. I felt like the whole way it was going to work just clicked in my mind. I dragged everyone in the lab to the whiteboard and started drawing, saying, &#8220;It works like this!&#8221;
        As a postdoc with David Bilder, I wanted to work on an epithelial morphogenesis process that happens in egg chambers at a later stage than what we currently study. I did a forward genetic screen to try to identify required factors, but it quickly became obvious that those mutations were not coming out of the screen.In the meantime, I started reading a lot of papers about oogenesis and this unusual planar polarity that occurs at the basal surface of the epithelium. And what 
        I had a technician working with me full time who helped with all of the genetics, fly-pushing, dissecting the ovaries out of the flies, and mounting of slides. But yeah, every single slide passed under my eyes. I would sometimes sit at the microscope for 6&#8211;8 hours at a time and the entire screen took about a year and a half.But it was worth it. We ended up with a marvelous collection of mutations, which is an ideal way to start a lab because you automatically have built-in projects for all of your first people. So I think it&#8217;s an amazingly good investment for a postdoc to do a genetic screen.</chapter><chapter title="SPINNING EGGS">
        A graduate student in the Bilder lab, Saori Haigo, began doing live imaging and discovered the rotational motion. After Saori&#8217;s paper was published, someone dug very deep into the literature and found that a researcher at ETH Zurich named D.F. Went had documented this motion in the ovaries of a gall midge in the 1970s with a 16 mm camera.I never cease being surprised&#8212;
        Everything that we&#8217;re studying is happening on the outer surface of this living, intact, organ-like structure. We can visualize these events with exquisite clarity, both what&#8217;s happening with the migrating cells and with the extracellular matrix.What&#8217;s really useful for us right now is the ability to study collective cell migration and BM dynamics in a way that hasn&#8217;t really been done before. Collective cell migration happens over and over during development, with cells migrating in cohorts or sheets.To migrate collectively, they&#8217;re using the same basic cell migration machinery. But what gets added on top of that is the ability of each cell to influence the migratory behavior of its neighbors. We&#8217;re interested in how these cells communicate with one another to achieve this efficient group dynamic.
        At first, people had speculated that the planar organization of actin bundles at the basal surface could arise through a system where a signal propagates from one cell to the next across the tissue. That could be happening from cell to cell, or from cell to ECM to cell.Knowing that Msn was a kinase, it seemed reasonable that it might be part of such a signaling system. But instead, we found out it&#8217;s just a fundamental protein that&#8217;s required for an individual cell to migrate. We had to start thinking about the system really differently&#8212;how does something required in each individual cell to migrate somehow lead to this planar organization of the entire tissue?It made us realize that it was the migratory behavior of the cells that was probably bringing those actin bundles into alignment across the tissue.</chapter><chapter title="SUPPORTING ACTORS">
        This was a total surprise and why doing forward genetics is so much fun. The first mutated gene we identified in my lab from that round egg screen encoded an enzyme required in the endoplasmic reticulum for the folding of collagen IV&#8212;an ingredient in the BM. One of my first graduate students, David Lerner, was fascinated by these cells that had collagen trapped inside.We eventually realized that all of this BM secretion machinery was not only polarized along the apical-basal axis, but it was also polarized along the planar axis, toward the trailing edge of the migrating cells. We still don&#8217;t know whether that is a significant finding for the biology. But it was a really striking observation of how localized all of this machinery was, at both the cell and tissue level.
        Yes, I&#8217;ve been so influenced by being in a cell biology department. Now I&#8217;m taken with this question of how you synthesize these very large matrix proteins, get them through the secretory pathway, and ultimately, how you can use that secretory machinery to modulate BM structure during development. I find these really hardcore protein secretion questions so satisfying. Honestly, I love it and I didn&#8217;t know that I would!
        No, but he has artistic tendencies. He has always been my absolute biggest supporter and he likes being involved in the lab. When I wrote a review on egg chamber morphogenesis, he decided he wanted to teach himself how to use computer drawing packages, and he&#8217;s been doing illustrations for most of my work ever since. It&#8217;s great because a simple illustration can often convey the biology much more clearly and can help orient an audience to look at the real data in tissues, too.
        My graduate advisor, Didier Stainier, has been and continues to be a wonderful mentor to me. What I really admire about him is that he takes a very rigorous approach to the science that he does The number of topics that his lab has made significant contributions to over the years is almost dizzying. He gives his people an amazing amount of freedom to explore their own creativity and I think that&#8217;s really valuable.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4504738"><title>Allostery through the computational microscope: cAMP activation of a canonical signaling domain</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Nature communications</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Robert D.</first-name><last-name>Malmstrom</last-name></author><author><first-name>Alexandr P.</first-name><last-name>Kornev</last-name></author><author><first-name>Susan S.</first-name><last-name>Taylor</last-name></author><author><first-name>Rommie E.</first-name><last-name>Amaro</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Article</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Introduction">Since the introduction of the allosteric effect in While experimental and computational approaches provide insight into allosteric mechanismsThe objective of our work is to apply cutting-edge computational approaches to explore the conformational ensemble of a protein with and without a bound ligand, thereby gaining insight into how the ensemble gives rise to protein function. This work focuses on the mechanism of ligand-driven allostery in the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain of protein kinase A&#8217;s (PKA) regulatory subunit. Despite extensive research conducted on this systemThe intercellular activation of PKA by cAMP is a prototypical example of ligand-protein allostery, which occurs through the cooperative binding of cAMP to tandem cyclic-nucleotide binding domains, designated A and B, in each of PKA&#8217;s regulatory subunitsThe existing crystallographic data provides only two conformational states for the cyclic-nucleotide binding domains, the holo-enzyme (a.k.a. H or However, such experiments are limited in their ability to elucidate details of the full structural ensemble. Instead, they provide averaged metrics that correlate to dynamic motions. Achieving an atomistic description of the underlying conformational ensemble and resolving the corresponding free-energy landscape will clarify the mechanisms by which cAMP modulates the function of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain.Because the PKA holo-enzyme contains four cyclic-nucleotide binding domains, cAMP-induced activation is a complicated process. A recent study by Boras et al.To build a foundation on which to address these questions, we simulated fully solvated atomistic models of the conformational ensembles of the A cyclic-nucleotide binding domain (hereafter referred to as the Similar approaches have been used to study protein foldingWe find that the conformational ensembles of cAMP-free (CBD-Apo) and cAMP-bound (CBD-cAMP) functional states exist within a shallow free-energy landscape that allows access to both experimentally determined functional conformations, indicating conformational selection as the principal mechanism of allostery with the isolated cyclic-nucleotide binding domain. We find that the addition of cAMP modifies the principal motions of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain, which correspond to transitions between active and inactive states. Furthermore, our approach exposes the propagation of the allosteric signal through the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain&#8217;s signaling motifs.Our results complement existing structural</chapter><chapter title="Results">To explore and map the conformational landscapes of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain, we integrated multiple molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with Markov state models. Explicit solvent MD simulations of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain were performed with and without cAMP-bound systems (CBD-cAMP and CBD-Apo, respectively).The MD simulations of both systems sampled a totaled 74 &#181;s (To build the Markov state models, we needed to define the conformational space, and then divide the space into discrete conformational states. As in protein-folding modelsAll conformations sampled from the MD simulations of both the CBD-Apo and CBD-cAMP systems were clustered together to create a comprehensive framework of conformational states. Once the conformation states were identified, Markov state models were built for each system. This means that the models were built using the same division of conformational space, but each model included only states sampled in its respective simulations. (A comparison between this approach and clustering conformations from CBD-Apo and CBD-cAMP separately is discussed below.)The Markov state models were built by specifying the maximum distance or Graphs of the Markov state models for CBD-Apo and CBD-cAMP are visualized as a network (A comparison of the models of the conformational state ensembles for the CBD-Apo and CBD-cAMP systems allowed us to assess how the binding of cAMP modifies the overall free-energy landscape. We compared the distribution of conformational states between the two systems, the overall character of the free-energy landscape, and the kinetics of traversing the free-energy landscape between functional conformations states. For this comparison, and throughout this work, we assumed that the crystallographic structures represent the functional conformations (active or inactive states) of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain. The nodes containing the functional conformations are indicated in When comparing the conformational landscapes of CBD-Apo and CBD-cAMP, we noticed two striking features: the large number of shared states (Many of the unique CBD-Apo conformational states contain structures in which the cAMP-binding site is formed poorly and, thus, sterically prevented from occurring when cAMP is bound (Using the most probable conformational state as the reference state, at physiological conditions the depth of free-energy landscape is 6.6 kcal molTransition pathway theoryTherefore, to understand the transition between active and inactive conformation states across the free-energy landscape, we needed to look at the transition pathways collectively. We measured the kinetics of the transition between active and inactive states using mean first passage times (i.e., the fastest average time it takes for the system to move across the free-energy landscape from active to inactive state, or These results indicate that CBD-Apo favors the inactive state, which inhibits PKA&#8217;s catalytic subunit, whereas CBD-cAMP favors the state that activates PKA&#8217;s catalytic subunit. Thus, the dynamics of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain derived from the Markov state models are consistent with the function of the regulatory subunit in PKA.Taken together, our results indicate conformational selection as the governing mechanism of allostery in the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain. The weakest evidence for this mechanism is the number of shared states between both models because it is largely a function of the clustering algorithm. However, when the conformations for each system are clustered separately, the results are the same. In fact, the joint clustering approach better captures the principal motions of the CBD at a 3.0 &#197; clustering cut-off, as determined by implied timescale plots (The stronger evidence supporting conformational selection is the change in the free-energy landscape and the corresponding transition kinetics. Weinkam and coworkersOne limitation of our models is the potential bias towards conformational selection because the simulations were initiated at both experimentally determined active and inactive states, which were included in and connected through the Markov state models. However, nothing sterically hinders cAMP from binding either functional conformational state in the absence of the catalytic subunit, and no restraints were required to keep cAMP bound during the simulations. Thus, all four systems used to initiate the simulations are potential members of the conformational ensemble. Starting the simulations in each experimental conformation does not predispose them to becoming members of highly populated or networked states or bias the transition kinetics between active and inactive states.While our results indicate conformational selection as the general mechanism of allostery for the CBD, this finding is not wholly novel due to previous experimental workTo understand the structural characteristics of the conformational landscapes, we built stationary probability density volumes of the positions of the alpha carbons. In other words, we sought to determine the probability of finding the mass of the alpha carbons in a given volume of space at equilibrium. The volumes were determined by dividing the space in 0.1 &#197; voxels and calculating the probability of finding an alpha carbon within 3 &#197; (the RMSD cut-off for the Markov state model) of the voxel for each conformational state. By summing over all states, we obtained a map of the stationary probability density, which provides a visual representation of the conformational ensembles.However, the differences between the stationary probability density volumes give us new structural insight into the mechanisms of allostery within the CBD. The first notable difference is the unique density formed by the B/C helix proximal to cAMP in the CBD-cAMP ensemble (To determine the principal motions of the CBD, we built kinetic coarse-grained models from the Markov state models of each system to identify metastable states or the principal motions of CBD arising from the conformational ensemble. These models were generated by complementarily employing principal component and Markov clustering analysisThe CBD-Apo implied timescale plots (Like the CBD-Apo system, the implied timescale plot for the CBD-cAMP system indicates one dominant slow motion followed by a number of faster motions (To strengthen the relationship between motions of the CBD and its function, we generated a functional coarse-grained model of the conformational ensembles. The model identifies which conformational stats have a higher probability of transitioning to either the active of inactive state, thus indicating the role of each conformational state in the function of the system. Using committer analysis from transition pathway theoryThe functional coarse-grain model of CBD-Apo (The functional coarse-grain model and the kinetic coarse-grain model closely correlate with each other as determined by conformational state membership in the functional or kinetic macrostates. Correlation between the two coarse-grained models is expected as they both depend on the transition kinetics of the Markov state models; however, which motion corresponded to the change in functional states is not clear The coarse-grained models combined with observations of the change in stationary probability densities for the two systems support a general explanation that the modification of the transition kinetics by cAMP gives rise to function. In CBD-Apo, transitions between states occur with a tendency towards the inactive conformation, which increases the likelihood of generating the interface that allows for the regulatory subunit to bind the catalytic subunit leading to inactivation of PKA. With cAMP bound, the transition between inactive and active states is slower, which is likely the result of interactions formed between the C-terminus and cAMP. The preference for the active-like conformations in the CBD-cAMP system decreases the probability of forming the binding interface and allowing activation of PKA.To gather more detail on the allosteric mechanism, we examined the propagation of an allosteric signal through the helical signaling motifs of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain by building new Markov state models for the three principal signaling motifs using the same MD trajectories (apo and cAMP-bound). While the motions of the signaling motifs are captured in the Markov state models of the full CBD, as discussed above, individual models elucidate the conformational ensembles of focused structural elements and provide an unobstructed view of their modulation by cAMP. The Markov state models for the individual motifs were developed and analyzed using the same methods for the full system (When we compared the conformational state distribution between the apo and cAMP-bound systems, we observed that the N3A motif and the B/C helix share a majority of their conformational states (Figure 7 and These results support and help explain why there is no observed change in chemical shifts in NMR experimentsIn contrast, the phosphate-binding cassette showed significant changes in chemical shifts upon binding cAMP.The spatial arrangement of the helical signaling motifs suggests that the propagation of the allosteric signal would be from the phosphate-binding cassette to the B/C helix to the N3A motif (However, the kinetics of the signaling motifs suggest another mechanism. The mean first passage times between active and inactive states suggest that the movement of the B/C helix is the rate-limiting step for the functional transition because it has the slowest transitions between active and inactive states (In PKA and other proteins, the experimental free energy of binding of cAMP to the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain is dominated by enthalpic contributions</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">Overall, we find that the prototype cyclic-nucleotide binding domain is a highly dynamic system and that cAMP modulates its function by modifying the dynamics of the signaling motifs. By comparing CBD-Apo and CBD-cAMP ensembles, we see that the free-energy landscape allows access to both active and inactive states through an ensemble of transition pathways (i.e., there is no one dominant pathway between states). Collectively, our analysis supports conformational selection as the general mechanism of allostery in this system. The addition of cAMP modulates the transition rates between the functional states but only between active-to-inactive states and not While the general mechanism of allostery for the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain is conformational selection, some elements of the mechanism appear to behave more like induced fit. Particularly notable in this regard are the interactions between the C-helix and cAMP, which generate multiple conformational states that are not sampled in the apo state, as compared to the motions of the individual signaling motifs that appear more similar to entropic mechanisms of allostery. Furthermore, in the context of activation of the full kinase, these mechanisms may change, as interaction with the catalytic subunit and the remaining portions of the regulatory subunit will almost certainly modulate the conformational ensemble of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain. This work suggests that a clearer picture of the free-energy landscape, achieved through an integrated experimental and computational approach, is required to fully understand allosteric behavior.Although a number of our conclusions were already observed experimentally, the power of our computational Markov-state-model-based approach is that it unifies multiple lines of existing experimental data into a single, cohesive framework and, thereby, achieves a more complete understanding of allostery. This approach builds on an emerging paradigm for understanding protein function and dynamics based on computational exploration and visualization of protein conformational ensembles and their underlying functional free-energy landscapes in atomic detail.</chapter><chapter title="Methods">We parameterized cAMP for the MD simulations as a small organic molecule using the Generalized Amber Force Field (GAFF)Using Schrodinger&#8217;s Maestro&#8217;s (Suite 2012: Maestro, version 9.3, Schr&#246;dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2012) PDB prep and the Desmond System Preparer, we prepared four systems for MD simulations, CBD-Apo and CBD-cAMP in both the active and inactive conformations. The heavy-atom atomic coordinates for the active and inactive conformations of CBD-Apo were taken for crystal structures 1RGSSystem coordinates from Maestro were converted into an xleap-readable format using in-house Python scripts. Each system was parameterized in xleap using the Amber99SBAll systems were minimized and equilibrated using the GPU version of Amber12MD simulations on AntonWe sampled the conformational ensemble from the equilibrated conformation of each system, starting each run with a different set of initial velocities. In conjunction with model building, we performed multiple adaptive sampling runs. These runs were initiated from preliminary Markov state model conformational states with &lt;3 members. These conformational states corresponded to clustered regions of the conformational ensemble poorly sampled by the MD simulations and, therefore, the transitions to and from those states were poorly sampled. For each under-sampled conformational state, one conformation was selected. From that conformation, three new 10&#8211;15 ns MD simulations were run, each with a new initial velocity using GPU-enabled AMBER12. The short MD simulations were sufficient to explore the local conformational landscape and return to a local energy minimum.MD trajectories were processed using CPPTRAJWe used MSMBuilder2For the Markov state model of the whole systems, we selected a clustering cut-off distance of 3.0 &#197; and a lag time of 80 steps or 9.6 ns. For consistency in comparing models, a lag time of 9.6 ns was used for all.The Markov state models were visualized using in-house Python scripts leveraging the publically available NetworkX moduleThe equilibrium population was determined from the first eigenvalue of the Markov state model&#8217;s transition probability matrix that corresponds to the equilibrium distribution of the conformational states.Transition pathway theory analysis was preformed using MSMBuilder2 transition pathway theory scriptsMarkov cluster analysis clustered the states of the Markov state model based on their kinetic relationships within the Markov state model using a random walk algorithm to determine local sinks in the Markov state modelAbsolute MFPT between the putative functional microstates was calculated as described in Singhal et al.The half-life of coarse-grained microstates was calculated using a kinetic Monte Carlo scheme on the Markov state model&#8217;s transitions matrix as described in Shukla et al.Assuming that transitioning out of one conformational state into its neighboring conformational states can be modeled as parallel reactions, we can treat the kinetics for the conformational changes between connected conformational states as first-order reactions. Therefore, we determined the rate constant using The free energy of a single microstate was calculated using The Markov state models of the signaling motifs were built and analyzed using the same methods described above except we only used a subset of C&#945;. The residues used for the analysis of each subdomain were: 119 to 151 for the N3A motif, 199 to 211 for the phosphate-binding cassette, and 226 to 244 for the B/C helix. Markov state models were built with a clustering cut-off of 4.5 &#197; for the N3A motif, 1.5 &#197; for the phosphate-binding cassette, and 4.5 &#197; for the B/C helix. The lag time used was 9.6 ns.MD trajectories, sample MD input scripts, and the Markov state model analysis scripts are available for download through datadryad.org</chapter><chapter title="Supplementary Material" /></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4581352"><title>Shared transcription factors contribute to distinct cell fates</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Transcription</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Felicia SL</first-name><last-name>Ng</last-name></author><author><first-name>Fernando J</first-name><last-name>Calero-Nieto</last-name></author><author><first-name>Berthold</first-name><last-name>G&#246;ttgens</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Point of View</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Abbreviations" /><chapter title="None">Transcription factors (TFs) are important regulators of cell-type-specific gene expression, and represent the paradigm for DNA-binding proteins that influence cellular development. Hematopoiesis has long served as a model to study the transcriptional control of cell type specification, and transcriptional regulatory elements for several major regulators of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been studied in detail using both mammalian and lower vertebrate model organisms.In a recent study, we examined the nature of binding site preferences and co-occupancy in 2 closely related cell types.We examined the observation of distinct binding patterns further by quantifying the differences in binding and their relationship to gene expression in a regression model (Many regression models described so far assumed that TF binding and gene expression have a linear relationship. Although linearity provides an easy means for performing computations, it is known that this relationship could be non-linear, at least for a subset of TFs. Indeed, gene expression has been shown to be a non-linear function of TF binding as shown in an analysis of K562 and GM112878 cell lines.TF binding depends on interactions with DNA and other TFs at regulatory regions, although it has been suggested that in some occasions it can be largely driven by its cellular environment with no functional consequences. We compared the motif content of common and cell-type-specific regulatory regions (Although binding of &#8216;shared&#8217; TFs without functional consequences cannot be ruled out for a given specific binding event, our results clearly indicate that the same TF can play an active and determinant role in different cell-type-specific transcriptional programs.</chapter><chapter title="Conclusions and Future Directions">Our recent analysis of genome-wide binding sites and gene expression in HPC7 and mast cells has provided new insights into our understanding of lineage-specific transcriptional regulation during differentiation. Furthermore, it reports comprehensive genome-scale data for primary mast cells, where until now very little genome-wide data existed. The use of computational and experimental approaches provided several lines of evidence to show that occupancy of distinct regions in different cell lineages by the same TFs are functionally important and not just a consequence of the cellular environment (It is well known that combinatorial TF binding is prevalent in the regulation of metazoan gene expression. However, the specific rules governing these TF interactions and the effects of individual regulatory elements on gene expression remain largely unknown, even though they are recognized to have broad implications for cellular reprogramming. In a study of differentiating embryonic stem cells, for example, the Isl1 protein functions as a component of 2 different regulatory complexes that differ by one TF but lead to either spinal or cranial motor neuron formation.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4601158"><title>Vaccines in the treatment of invasive candidiasis</title><article-type>review-article</article-type><journal-title>Virulence</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Xiao-juan</first-name><last-name>Wang</last-name></author><author><first-name>Xue</first-name><last-name>Sui</last-name></author><author><first-name>Lan</first-name><last-name>Yan</last-name></author><author><first-name>Yan</first-name><last-name>Wang</last-name></author><author><first-name>Yong-bing</first-name><last-name>Cao</last-name></author><author><first-name>Yuan-ying</first-name><last-name>Jiang</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Reviews</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Introduction">Invasive candidiasis is the third to fourth most common bloodstream infection in the United States.

However, the adjuvant is also a key factor in enhancing the immune response by promoting the antigenicity of an immunogen. It causes substantial and additional activation of T-cells or B-cells. In recent years, Freund's adjuvant has been extensively used in animals, especially in mice models. But now it's no longer recommended because of its painful reaction and potential tissue damage. Instead, the alum adjuvant is widely used in humans. In the future, in order to achieve better efficacy without side effects, new adjuvants or modified adjuvants should be tested.Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells that have a branching or dendritic morphology and have phagocytic functions; DCs connect innate immunity with adaptive immunity. Using DCs as vehicles to present vaccines to T cells would promote the proliferation of specific antigens and the cell-mediated immune response.Apart from DCs delivery, there are some other carriers, including nasal delivery systems, lipid particle delivery systems, DNA delivery, and virosome delivery, which are all approaches to enhance the activity of At present, most A significant challenge to the development of effective vaccines will be to elicit immune responses in immunocompromised individuals who are most at risk for invasive fungal infections.

These proteins share a distinct pocket domain necessary for binding E2F transcription factors and LXCXE motif-containing cellular proteins, including the D-type cyclins and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In their hypo- or unphosphorylated forms, the pocket proteins negatively regulate cell cycle progression through interaction with E2F/DP heterodimers and the recruitment of HDACs that promote chromatin condensation and repress transcription [A multiprotein unit has been identified in human complexes, termed DREAM whose composition is regulated at distinct phases of the cell cycle [In this study, we investigated how representative E7 proteins from HR mucocutaneous and cutaneous HPV types target p130. We constructed a p130 mutant that is defective in binding the HPV E7 LXCXE motif (p130mE7) based on conserved amino acids shown previously to be critical for pRB binding to LXCXE-containing viral oncoproteins [</chapter><chapter title="Results and discussion">To construct a p130 mutant unable to bind the E7 LXCXE motif (p130mE7) we replaced two amino acids in the B pocket that are conserved in pRB and shown previously to be essential for LXCXE-binding [To investigate whether or not the p130mE7 and p130PM22/mE7 mutants could complex with DREAM in CaSki cells, the nuclear lysates from transfected cells were co-precipitated with Lin-9 antibody and probed on western blots using HA and p130 antibodies. As anticipated from the differential expression of p130 proteins (Fig.&#160;To test whether transfection with p130wt or any of the mutants had effects on the cell cycle in CaSki cells, transfected cells were harvested, stained with propidium iodide and analysed by flow cytometry.

In contrast, neither p130wt nor p130PM22 had any effect on the cell cycle, with 55.7&#160;% and 55&#160;% at G0/G1, respectively. These results reflected the ability of p130mE7 and p130PM22/mE7 to form DREAM complexes (Fig.&#160;To confirm that HPV16 E7 targets p130 through its LXCXE motif, T98G (human glioblastoma) cells were transfected with pMSCVpuro vectors encoding HA-tagged p130wt, p130mE7, p130PM22 and p130PM22/mE7 together with 16E7.

More specifically, the results suggest that HPV16 E7 targets p130 predominantly through direct interactions via the LXCXE motif whereas HPV48 E7 disrupts p130-DREAM via CDK2 phosphorylation of p130.

Caused by the bacteria The aims of this paper are 1) to measure and compare levels of acceptability of tick control interventions, as well as their associated socio-cognitive factors, and 2) to describe perceived issues that may explain their low acceptability in populations living in two different regions, one being an endemic region for LD since the last 30&#160;years, the Neuch&#226;tel canton, in Switzerland, and another where the disease is emerging, the Mont&#233;r&#233;gie region, in Qu&#233;bec, Canada [</chapter><chapter title="Methods">A mixed methods&#8217; design was undertaken for this comparative study. In both study regions, quantitative data were collected to measure levels of acceptability for different interventions as well as their potential associated factors, and qualitative data were collected concurrently to identify and describe perceived issues that may explain the low acceptability of the least accepted interventions. Results of both qualitative and quantitative analysis were interpreted together as complementary approaches to answer the study objectives. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants. This procedure and the study protocol were reviewed by the ethical committee for health research of the University of Montreal (Comit&#233; d&#8217;&#233;thique de la recherche en sant&#233;, CERES) (certificate number 12-050-CERES-D), and the ethical certificate was approved by the Universit&#233; de Neuch&#226;tel.Quantitative data were collected using cross-sectional web-surveys conducted simultaneously in fall 2012 in both study regions, the Mont&#233;r&#233;gie region (Descriptive and multivariable statistical analyses were conducted. For the descriptive analyses, we calculated the proportions of respondents with high acceptability (individual scores of 4 or 5 on the Likert&#8217;s scale) for each of the eight interventions by region. Confidence intervals for proportions (confidence level of 95 %) were calculated using Agresti-Coull method with R software [For the multivariable analysis, eight multivariable logistic regression models were built: one per region for each of these four interventions: Qualitative data were collected during five focus group discussions (FGD) conducted between August and October 2012 (previously to the websurveys) in Neuch&#226;tel city and La-Chaux-de Fond (Neuch&#226;tel canton, Switzerland) and in Saint-Hyacinthe and Longueuil (Mont&#233;r&#233;gie region, Qu&#233;bec, Canada). In each region, residents who were more than 18&#160;years old were invited to participate. Recruitment of this convenience sample was done locally through posters displayed in grocery stores, train stations, universities, public parks and health centers. Advertisements were also posted on outdoor group websites and sent to their members via e-mail. Specific questions addressed were: &#8220;Since when did you know LD? What worries you about this disease? What do you think about these interventions to prevent LD? Are they acceptable according to you and why?&#8221;. Four environmental interventions were specifically addressed during FGD, based on their anticipated low level of acceptability in the targeted populations: A thematic analysis was performed by the principal researcher (Aenishaenslin C) with the objective to identify and describe the perceived issues that may contribute to the low acceptability of the four selected interventions [</chapter><chapter title="Results">The proportions of respondents with high level of acceptability were significantly higher in Mont&#233;r&#233;gie for all interventions (Fig.&#160;In the multivariable analyses, socio-cognitive factors that were statistically associated with high acceptability of Thirty-four participants were recruited for the five FGD (specific locations, number of participants and participant characteristics are presented in Table&#160;Through qualitative analysis, we identified eight common themes representing the perceived issues that may explain the low acceptability of the four selected interventions in the FGD performed in both regions. The recurrence of these themes into all focus groups suggests that a good level of data saturation was achieved. The first and commonly reported in both regions was the perception that the intervention would be disproportionate to manage the level of risk due to LD. Even with a good knowledge of LD and being aware that the risk of contracting the disease was present in their region, participants frequently mentioned that LD risk was not high enough for the population to justify the use of tick control interventions, as reported by a Mont&#233;r&#233;gie participant: Implementing these tick control interventions to prevent LD was also perceived as a threat to individual empowerment. It was perceived that if public health authorities made the choice of using such interventions, individuals would be tempted to distance themselves from their responsibility to adopt preventive behaviors: We did not identify major differences through qualitative analysis in categories of issues explaining low acceptability of these tick control interventions between Neuch&#226;tel and Mont&#233;g&#233;rie participants. One observed difference was that Neuch&#226;tel participants more frequently stated that public authorities should prioritize actions aiming to raise the population awareness on LD and promote individual preventive behaviors instead of considering the use of tick control interventions to reduce LD risk: </chapter><chapter title="Discussion">This study showed that the levels of acceptability of tick control interventions to prevent LD was low in Neuch&#226;tel and Mont&#233;r&#233;gie, with only two interventions out of eight (Surprisingly, the fact that levels of acceptability of all interventions were even lower in Neuch&#226;tel canton was unexpected, given our initial hypothesis which stated that populations living in regions with higher incidence of LD would be more receptive to tick control interventions. Neuch&#226;tel canton has an incidence estimated to be between 49 to 95 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year (data from 1996 and 2001) [Results from multivariable analyses showed that high perceived efficacy was strongly associated with high acceptability of interventions, and that risk perception was also a factor associated with it in several logistic models. These two socio-cognitive factors were associated with the adoption of individual preventive behaviors toward LD in a recent study which analyzed the same sampled populations [We found no statistical difference in the strength of association between high perceived efficacy of the intervention, risk perception, high level of knowledge on LD and high acceptability between both regions. This result is interesting given that the studied population contexts differed on several aspects, including their LD epidemiological situation, their history with the disease and their socio-cultural context. We could not find other published studies that measured such an association over the past. Further research conducted in other countries or regions where LD is present would be needed to support these findings.The eight perceived issues identified to explain low acceptability of selected interventions have interesting similarities with the decision criteria identified by stakeholders involved in LD prevention and control in two previous studies conducted in Qu&#233;bec, Canada [This study has some limitations. First, this study design was cross-sectional and cannot presume of any causal relationships between factors associated with high acceptability in the quantitative analyses. Moreover, quantitative data were collected using a web panel and the sample cannot be considered as probabilistic. Nevertheless, distributions of gender, age and level of education of both studied samples were representative of demographic characteristics of Mont&#233;r&#233;gie and Neuch&#226;tel, as described in further details in Aenishaenslin et al. 2014 [Regarding qualitative analysis, it is important to underline that the perceived issues identified to explain the low acceptability represent the perceptions of two small groups of participants, and may change over time according to contextual factors such as modifications in LD epidemiological situation or in the media attention toward this subject. The qualitative analysis was performed to explore perceived issues in the general public, but this approach cannot produce results that can be directly generalised to both regional populations. Also, FGD participants were recruited on a voluntary basis, and fewer participants manifested their interest to participate in Mont&#233;r&#233;gie than in Neuch&#226;tel (12 participants in Mont&#233;r&#233;gie </chapter><chapter title="Conclusion">This study strongly suggests that the perceived efficacy of public health interventions and LD risk perception in populations may be factors to consider in communication and knowledge translation efforts to increase the acceptability of tick control interventions when appropriate. Public health authorities may expect a higher level of reluctance to accept some of these interventions in populations with a higher level of knowledge about the disease, which may orient the consideration of different preventive strategies. In addition, low acceptability cannot be explained only by issues that may closely affect individuals such as immediate adverse health effects. Individuals who participated in this study expressed multiple issues related to LD management at the community level, such as possible impacts on environment and wildlife, high public costs and disempowerment of the population. These concerns are shared by decision-makers and can be integrated to the decision-making process by using tools such as multi-criteria decision analysis. Results of this study highlight the importance for decision-makers to account for regional socio-cognitive factors and perceived issues that may affect the acceptability of interventions in the target populations in order maximize the efficacy of interventions to prevent and control LD. Moreover, the study underlines the importance for decision-makers to be explicit about the public costs, the scale at which the intervention will be implemented, and its known impacts on ecosystems, when presenting an intervention to the target populations, as these aspects can modify its acceptability.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700562"><title>HIV-1 latency and virus production from unintegrated genomes following direct infection of resting CD4 T cells</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Retrovirology</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Chi N.</first-name><last-name>Chan</last-name></author><author><first-name>Benjamin</first-name><last-name>Trinit&#233;</last-name></author><author><first-name>Caroline S.</first-name><last-name>Lee</last-name></author><author><first-name>Saurabh</first-name><last-name>Mahajan</last-name></author><author><first-name>Akanksha</first-name><last-name>Anand</last-name></author><author><first-name>Dominik</first-name><last-name>Wodarz</last-name></author><author><first-name>Steffanie</first-name><last-name>Sabbaj</last-name></author><author><first-name>Anju</first-name><last-name>Bansal</last-name></author><author><first-name>Paul A.</first-name><last-name>Goepfert</last-name></author><author><first-name>David N.</first-name><last-name>Levy</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Research</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Background">The failure of the majority of HIV-1 reverse transcripts to integrate into cellular chromosomal DNA has been apparent since the initial molecular descriptions of infection in vivo and in vitro [We have previously reported that when cellular coinfection places an integrated provirus (iDNA) in a cell together with an unintegrated genome, viral complementation allows completion of the unintegrated virus&#8217; replication cycle without integration [The predominant model for establishment of HIV-1 latency entails the infection of an activate CD4 T cell that returns to a resting state, thus removing support for viral transcription [To this end, we recently described a convenient and relevant model system [In the present study we investigated the properties of uDNA and integrated proviruses (iDNA) in resting CD4 T cells, finding substantial and unexpected differences in the kinetics of their gene expression, persistence and virus production.

We conclude that unintegrated HIV-1 should be accounted for in models employing direct infection of non-proliferating cells such as resting CD4 T cells. Should these mechanisms pertain in vivo, the persistence of non-proliferating cells expressing HIV-1 proteins from uDNA may be threatened more by anti-HIV immunity than by biochemical degradation or viral cytopathic effects.</chapter><chapter title="Results">This study utilizes envelope-defective single round GFP reporter viruses expressing GFP in place of Nef, with Nef expressed at wild type levels downstream of an IRES element [Given the long life span of resting CD4 T cells and the stability of circularized HIV-1 uDNA in them, we investigated the kinetics of gene expression from uDNA vs. iDNA in these cells after a single round of infection (Fig.&#160;Next, we stimulated the entire cell population consisting of both GFP+ cells that are productively infected as well as the GFP-negative cells that comprise both uninfected and non-productively infected cells (Fig.&#160;Importantly, two distinct peaks of GFP expression appeared in the No RAL cultures treated with Pro/TSA days 5&#8211;7 (assay days 7&#8211;9, arrows in Fig.&#160;</chapter><chapter title="Response of latent unintegrated vs. integrated HIV-1 to a series of latency reversing agents">We next examined latent uDNA responses to several latency reversing agents (LRA) being considered as components of curative therapies.

As a result, resting CD4 T cells expressed proteins and viruses from unintegrated genomes for longer than from integrated proviruses. The extended persistent expression from uDNA vs. iDNA was evident both during initial infection of cells and after reversal of latency. We also found that uDNA failed to down modulate HLA Class I surface expression on resting CD4 T cells, and HIV-1-specific CTL efficiently killed cells infected with unintegrated HIV-1. Thus, in vivo, uDNA may contribute to the development of anti-HIV-1 immune responses and to immune-dependent cell loss.The de novo synthesis of virions from unintegrated HIV-1 requires a particular set of conditions that is clearly not the majority circumstance in vivo, and virus production by unintegrated HIV-1 in resting CD4 T cells is usually about one order of magnitude lower than from viruses which were capable of integration. Importantly, in vivo, most viruses are generated from activated T cells, which generate several-fold more viruses than resting T cells [Investigations into the regulation of HIV-1 latency rely heavily on in vitro models, with several prominent systems utilizing direct infection of resting T cells (reviewed in [The potential of shock and kill therapies to eliminate latent reservoirs will depend upon these cells dying after virus activation, either via viral cytopathic effects or by immune killing [Success of shock and kill will also depend upon activating all latent replication competent genomes; however, this task is complicated by the multifactorial nature of HIV-1 latency [Two basic and non-exclusive models for the establishment of HIV-1 latency have been proposed. Siliciano and Chun, after analyzing quiescent blood CD4 T cells, initially suggested that a rapid return to quiescence of recently infected activated cells can induce transcriptional silencing, as necessary transcription factors are withdrawn. This model has the logical benefits that (1) most in vivo latency in blood resides within previously activated memory CD4 T cells, and (2) it has been commonly accepted, based on studies of purified blood T cells, that quiescent (resting) CD4 T cells are poorly infectible, though infection and latency are possible even without stimulation [The responses of latent uDNA to the panel of latency reversing agents, measured as the induction of GFP+ cells and virions from sorted GFP-negative cells treated with raltegravir, obeyed the same basic pattern as when integration was allowed to proceed. However, the dynamic range of de novo virus production was substantially greater from unintegrated HIV-1, with weak stimuli inducing roughly equal numbers of GFP+ cells and 7&#8211;20&#160;% as many virions as when integration is not blocked, while strong stimuli induced 2&#8211;3 times as many GFP+ cells and 30&#8211;66&#160;% as many virions within 24&#160;h and up to &gt;200&#160;% more virions over 3&#160;days. Thus, as the strength of the stimulus increased, relatively more uDNA genomes were recruited out of latency compared with integrated proviruses. This greater dynamic range of uDNA responses to LRA suggests that uDNA transcription is regulated differently from iDNA. Chromatin structures that are proximal to the HIV-1 transcriptional regulatory regions, chief among these being promoter-proximal nucleosomes, regulate the susceptibility of HIV-1 to transcriptional activation. The ability of histone deacetylase inhibitors to reverse latency is thought to be due at least in part to the displacement of promoter-proximal nucleosomes following histone acetylation. The responsiveness of uDNA from HIV-1 and other retroviruses to HDACi, which has been observed before by others and by us [Antiviral immunity, particularly cytotoxic T cells, is envisioned to assist eradication of cells containing recently activated viruses. However, CTL killing in this scenario cannot necessarily be taken for granted [</chapter><chapter title="Methods">Viruses have been described previously [Peripheral blood buffy coats from HIV&#8211;1-negative adults were purchased from the New York Blood Center.

During the same recording session, the children participated in an EEG recording with three to four stimulus sequences with background noise [Brain Vision Analyzer 2.0 (BrainProducts, GmpH) was used for offline analysis. Data were down sampled to 250&#160;Hz and re-referenced to the average of the mastoid electrodes. Band pass filtering of .5&#8211;45&#160;Hz, 24&#160;dB/oct was applied to avoid aliasing and signals not originated from the brain [To identify the P3a and LN, ERPs for standards were subtracted from those for novels. The grand average difference waves showed the biphasic P3a elicited by novel stimuli. Hence, eP3a and lP3a were separately analyzed. The channel selection for the peak detection was done after visual inspection, which showed the most prominent eP3a at the Cz electrode and lP3a and LN at the Fz electrode. The peak detection was done individually for each child within time windows of 180&#8211;300&#160;ms for eP3a, 300&#8211;440&#160;ms for lP3a, and 420&#8211;600&#160;ms for LN. The peak latencies were determined from the most positive (eP3a and lP3a) or the most negative (LN) peak within those windows, and the mean peak amplitudes were calculated from &#177;20&#160;ms time window around the peak latencies.The statistical analyses were done for the F3, Fz, F4, C3, Cz, C4, P3, Pz, and P4 electrodes.

For that purpose, the P3a and LN elicited by distracting novel sounds were measured in the linguistic multi-feature paradigm at the time when all the participants had healthy ears and their sound encoding reflected by obligatory ERPs was found to be intact in an earlier study [The amplitude, distribution, or latency of the eP3a did not differ between the groups. This suggests the similar automatic detection of a novel stimulus and the early stages of the orientation of attention [In contrast, a significant group difference was found in the lP3a reflecting the actual attention switch [The LN latency was longer in the children with RAOM than in the controls suggesting delayed reorienting back to the ongoing activity [Our results show that RAOM has long-term effects leading to abnormal attention control at the age of 2&#160;years when rapid developmental neural changes are involved. Studies on attentional neural mechanisms in older children with early childhood RAOM would be pertinent since they would disclose whether the neural changes observed are transient or still persisting at the later stages of development.There were two children in the RAOM group who were excluded from the group analysis because of their abnormally enhanced P3a responses. The exclusion was done to avoid the bias of these statistically confirmed outliers on the results of the RAOM group. However, we should notice that these extreme P3a responses might reflect a genuine effect of RAOM and indicate enhanced distractibility of these children, but this should be studied further in the future.When interpreting the results, it should be taken into account that the accurate hearing thresholds were not available at the time of the measurement. Accurate hearing thresholds can be reliably measured from the age of three onwards [</chapter><chapter title="Conclusions">To conclude, this study showed abnormal neural mechanisms of involuntary attention in 2-year-old children with RAOM. For the distracting novel sounds, the RAOM group showed atypical neural organization signified by a more even lP3a scalp distribution in anterior-posterior axis than in the controls, who had a more frontally oriented lP3a. This can be a sign of immature neural processing and enhanced distractibility. Furthermore, the children with RAOM showed delayed re-orienting back to the ongoing activity indicated by their prolonged LN latency. Since all the children had clinically healthy ears at the time of the study, the current results suggest that early childhood RAOM has long-term effects on the immature central nervous system. This further supports the suggestion that early childhood RAOM should be taken as a risk factor for the developing auditory central nervous system.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700566"><title>Co-linearity and divergence of the A subgenome of </title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>BMC Genomics</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Jun</first-name><last-name>Zou</last-name></author><author><first-name>Dandan</first-name><last-name>Hu</last-name></author><author><first-name>Peifa</first-name><last-name>Liu</last-name></author><author><first-name>Harsh</first-name><last-name>Raman</last-name></author><author><first-name>Zhongsong</first-name><last-name>Liu</last-name></author><author><first-name>Xianjun</first-name><last-name>Liu</last-name></author><author><first-name>Isobel A.

Other aminoglycoside antibiotics include 2-deoxystreptamine (2-DOS) containing gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, and butirosin. However, the critical resistance mechanism of aminoglycoside antibiotics in pathogens is enzymatic inactivation. As such, semi-synthetic aminoglycosides have been created to overcome pathogen enzymatic inactivation. For example, isepamicin is developed by introducing (S)-3-amino-2-hydroxypropionyl side chains to the 1-amino group of gentamicin B. This side chain can block the modification by various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. Thus, isepamicin is highly stable against aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes [Isepamicin is manufactured from gentamicin B, which is co-produced in The biosynthetic pathway of gentamicin has been elucidated (Fig.&#160;The structure of gentamicin B resembles that of both gentamicin C and kanamycin A.

Galvez et al. illustrated that the presence of convenience stores is associated with increased risk of obesity [It is also suggested that lack of supermarkets and grocery stores, which provide healthy options, contribute to the risk of obesity [Few studies have assessed the association between food environment and DM at the macro level. Yet, it is important for county-level studies to research how attributes within the built environment contribute to DM prevalence and research how access to food influences eating behavior [This study aims to examine the relationship between the density of four types of food outlets- fast food restaurants, convenience stores, super stores, and grocery stores- and the prevalence of county-level DM in 2011 in South Carolina, while adjusting for the following county-level risk factors: obesity, physical inactivity, recreation facility density, unemployment, education, households with no cars and limited access to stores, and race.</chapter><chapter title="Methods">This study was an ecological analysis examining the relationship between four types of food outlet densities- fast food restaurants, convenience stores, super stores, and grocery stores- and DM prevalence in 2011 among the 46 counties of South Carolina. The analysis controlled for the following county-level covariates: obesity, physical inactivity, density of recreation facilities, unemployment, education, households with no car and limited access to stores, and race. Multiple secondary data sources were used: the US Census Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) Line Files [The South Carolina county map was retrieved from the US Census TIGER Line Files for 2011 [DM prevalence is the age-adjusted percentage of adults (age&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;20) in South Carolina with diabetes excluding those with gestational diabetes in 2011. DM prevalence was obtained from the CDC [Fast food restaurants, convenience stores, super stores, and grocery stores were downloaded from the USDA 2011 data [Fast food restaurant densities are the number of limited-service restaurants in each county in South Carolina per 1000 residents. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for fast food restaurants is 722211 and includes businesses mainly engaged in providing food services where customers pay before eating. Food may be consumed at the establishment, taken out, or delivered.Convenience store densities are the number of convenience stores in each county in South Carolina per 1000 residents. The NAICS codes for convenience stores are 445120 and 447110 and includes stores mainly engaged in providing limited goods such as bread, soda, and snacks.Super store densities are the number of supercenters and warehouse clubs in each county in South Carolina per 1000 residents. The NAICS code for super stores is 452910 and includes stores mainly engaged in providing groceries along with general lines of merchandise.Grocery store densities are the number of supermarkets and grocery stores in each county in South Carolina per 1000 residents. The NAICS code for grocery store is 445110 and includes stores mainly known as supermarkets and excludes convenience stores with or without gasoline sales as well as large, general-merchandise stores.The covariates considered for this study are obesity, physical inactivity, recreation, unemployment, education, households with no car and at least one mile away from a store, and race.Obesity prevalence is the age-adjusted percentage of adults (age&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;20) in South Carolina with a body mass index&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;30 in 2011. Body mass index is computed by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. Physical inactivity prevalence is the age-adjusted prevalence of adults (age&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;20) in South Carolina, who reported no leisure-time physical activity in the past 30 days in 2011. These data were obtained from the CDC collected from BRFSS [Recreation is the number of recreational facilities in each county in South Carolina per 1000 residents in 2011 and obtained from the USDA [Unemployment is the unemployment rate in each county in South Carolina in 2011.

These data were obtained from the USDA [Race is the percentage of each county&#8217;s resident population in South Carolina that is non-Hispanic Black or African American in 2010 obtained from the USDA [Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficients were computed to assess the crude relationship between each food outlet density and DM prevalence in SAS software, Version 9.3 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Bivariate maps were created in ESRI ArcGIS (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA) to represent the geographical distribution of food outlet densities and DM prevalence among the 46 counties in South Carolina. DM prevalence was split into three ranks based on the following measures: 7.6&#8211;10.5&#160;%, 10.6&#8211;13.0&#160;%, and 13.1&#8211;15.6&#160;%. Likewise, food outlet densities were split into three ranks. Fast food restaurant densities were based on the following categories: 0.25&#8211;0.50, 0.51&#8211;0.70, and 0.71&#8211;1.13. Convenience store densities: 0.32&#8211;0.60, 0.61&#8211;0.80, and 0.81&#8211;1.12. Super store densities: 0&#8211;0.001, 0.002&#8211;0.02, and 0.03&#8211;0.04. Grocery store densities: 0&#8211;0.15, 0.16&#8211;0.20, and 0.21&#8211;0.31. Categories were created based on equal intervals or included at least ten counties in a category.To analyze the association between each food outlet density and DM prevalence, linear regression models using ordinary least squares (OLS) method were calculated in ArcGIS. OLS regression was completed with DM as the dependent variable and adjusting for obesity, physical inactivity, recreation, unemployment, education, households with no car and limited access to a store, and race. Diagnostics of the models were performed and did not show spatial autocorrelation and did not violate other model assumptions. Multicollinearity was assessed and all Variance Inflation Factors were less than 7.0. Diagnostics also showed that the variables explain 80&#160;% of the variation observed.</chapter><chapter title="Results">Table&#160;Figure&#160;Pearson correlation coefficients between each food outlet density and DM prevalence are presented in Table&#160;Table&#160;</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">Type II Diabetes Mellitus, along with other chronic diseases, is growing rapidly in South Carolina and the United States. Since the built environment has been shown to influence DM [The expectation that fast food restaurants and convenience stores are positively associated with DM and that super stores and grocery stores are negatively associated with DM was more evident in the bivariate maps. Aligned with our hypothesis, Hampton County for example, had the highest rank combination between fast food restaurant densities and DM prevalence as well as convenience store densities and DM prevalence. In fact, Hampton County has the highest prevalence of DM and obesity within South Carolina. This county also had the lowest rank of super store densities and the highest rank of grocery store densities. With Hampton County having one of the state&#8217;s smallest population densities, the lack of super stores is to be expected [Our results are unexpected due to the lack of healthful foods provided by fast food restaurants and convenience stores [The null findings regarding super store densities and grocery store densities to DM prevalence contradict the literature. Other studies found that larger food stores and super stores are associated with better access to high quality food, such as fresh fruits and vegetables [The significant covariates in the regression models were obesity, physical inactivity, and race (except when considering the density of fast food restaurants as the exposure). This is expected because DM disproportionately affects non-Hispanic Blacks and African Americans. Previous studies have found that Blacks and disadvantaged groups are more likely to live in areas with inadequate access to healthy foods directly affecting their health [This study has several limitations. DM, obesity, and physical inactivity were based on self-reported data collected by BRFSS. However, studies have shown self-report DM based on a physician&#8217;s diagnosis to be highly validated [</chapter><chapter title="Conclusions">Overall, findings from this ecological study do not show significant associations between any of the four types of food outlets and the prevalence of DM. This emphasizes the role of individual behavioral decisions on DM prevalence as well as the need for studies that examine the role of food outlet density on health outcomes at various spatial scales. DM and other chronic diseases are multi-faceted and relate to many factors including both individual and environmental as well as social and cultural. Therefore, to further understand the impact on DM, future research should include both the structure of the built environment- food outlets and recreational space- and individual factors in order to construct a thorough, comprehensive model of the contextual factors contributing to the increase of chronic diseases. Assessing the environmental, social, and cultural determinants of chronic diseases is key in establishing health-promoting environments. There is a strong need to advocate for such environmental change.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700569"><title>Brief report on ecological momentary assessment: everyday states predict HIV prevention behaviors</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>BMC Research Notes</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Paul F.</first-name><last-name>Cook</last-name></author><author><first-name>Catherine J.</first-name><last-name>McElwain</last-name></author><author><first-name>Lucy A.</first-name><last-name>Bradley-Springer</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Short Report</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Findings">Preventing transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a major public health issue. Behaviors like abstinence, condom use, and/or using clean needles help persons living with HIV (PLWH) avoid transmitting HIV to others [Although prevention programs for PLWH have been developed based on various theoretical models and many of these are efficacious [Many health phenomena including HIV prevention behaviors can be meaningfully understood as Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods evaluate momentary states and behaviors close to the time they actually occur [This pilot study examined potential momentary state predictors of HIV prevention behaviors based on a motivational model in which five momentary state variables predict motivation for HIV prevention, which in turn predicts HIV prevention behaviors [Given that a single failure of HIV prevention behaviors can lead to transmission, and that these behaviors occur relatively infrequently in the context of everyday life, the future development of both theory and interventions depends on a better understanding of state-level predictors of behavior. Overall patterns tend to be easier to discern than the variables that predict specific incidents, but they are less useful when attempting to intervene [Data were collected in a pilot study using daily electronic surveys with PLWH. The study&#8217;s methods are published elsewhere [This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (protocol #06-0948). Participants were 21 PLWH recruited from an outpatient infectious disease practice in Denver, CO. Another 15 PLWH invited to the study declined to participate, primarily because of the time commitment required. Quota sampling was used to recruit a diverse sample in terms of race/ethnicity and gender, approximating the current demographics of the U. S. HIV epidemic [Each participant was given a personal digital assistant (PDA) handheld computer and asked to complete a 5-minute questionnaire (26&#8211;46 questions, depending on skip logic) once daily at a time they had pre-selected. Participants completed the questionnaire once at the start of the study with a research assistant, to ensure that they understood the questions and the response choices. PDAs were password-protected. Daily responses were date- and time-stamped. Participants completed questionnaires on 72&#160;% of study days (range 37&#8211;92&#160;%) for an average of 4&#160;months (range 1&#8211;8). A total of 2319 daily questionnaires were completed by 21 PLWH during the 6-month study. The original study was designed to identify the optimal duration of daily monitoring, so variability in the number of data points per individual was expected. PLWH returned to the clinic in person to download data from their PDA every 2&#160;months. At these visits, PLWH also answered open-ended questions to identify any additional factors that they believed impacted their HIV prevention behaviors. Participants were paid $25 per visit, and were allowed to keep their PDAs if they participated for at least 2&#160;months.Daily PDA questionnaires were used to evaluate participants&#8217; state-level control beliefs,For the dependent variable in the analysis, participants answered questions about their HIV Data were analyzed using a prospective prediction strategy in which each participant&#8217;s scores on each momentary state predictor variable were compared with their self-reported behavior at the subsequent data collection point, which was usually the next day. Multilevel models were used to correct for the intra-class correlation (Participants reported an overall moderate level of HIV prevention behaviors during the study, In an interview question asked during the baseline assessment, 100&#160;% of participants said they had adequate knowledge of how to prevent HIV transmission. Interestingly, 70&#160;% (16/21) said they also had adequate knowledge of how to prevent HIV infection at the time they were originally infected with HIV. Neither current nor past self-reported knowledge of HIV prevention had any relationship to current HIV prevention behaviors as reported on the daily questionnaires, Table&#160;In addition to the momentary state variables included in daily surveys, participants said that health context variables were important for their HIV prevention behaviors. For instance, participants said they were more likely to take steps for prevention when they were feeling well, but that they also might be more likely to encounter risky situations. Participants suggested that the researchers should ask further questions about medication use, side effects, and stigma experiences with health care providers, especially new providers. Despite a lack of significant findings on the coping scale, participants&#8217; feedback indicated that this set of items was interesting and relevant to their daily lives: some participants stated that the questionnaire made them more aware of how stress impacted their daily moods and reactions, while others said it made them more aware of their own coping strategies.PLWH reported relatively high and consistent prevention behaviors over the course of this study, and these did not correlate with momentary states measured on the same day. However, momentary states did prospectively predict HIV prevention behaviors the next day. Consistent with research on trait-level predictors of HIV prevention behaviors [The current study confirms previous findings about the state-level effects of mood [The current study tested whether momentary states Because the current findings are based on a small sample, they may not generalize to all PLWH, and even predictors with weak effects might still be appropriate for further research. Although this study used quota sampling to recruit PLWH who were demographically similar to the U.S. HIV epidemic as a whole, results still may generalize primarily to White PLWH because of the higher attrition among minority PLWH. All data provided by minority participants were included in the analysis, but the total number of data points from this group was smaller. Statistical power was adequate to detect moderate effects based on over 2300 daily questionnaires completed by participants, but high between-participant variability in a small sample might have contributed to weaker than expected effects. The number of participants is comparable to the small To partially address the limitations of significance testing with a small sample, we reported effect sizes (correlation coefficients) for all analyses to quantify the relative importance of each studied predictor variable. Additionally, we asked participants open-ended questions to identify other variables that might be important to study. These questions revealed that PLWH saw healthcare variables including adherence, side effects, and provider relationships as potentially important for future research of this type. In addition, PLWH emphasized the importance of coping as an important factor in HIV prevention behaviors; even though this study showed small and nonsignificant effects of stress and coping on prevention behaviors, based on the findings of other studies [Momentary states are under-studied, proximal variables that appear to predict HIV prevention behaviors among PLWH, and that may have different effects from trait-level predictors because they are less affected by biases associated with recall and interpretation. Despite a small sample size, our study gathered a large amount of data from individual participants and examined a range of predictor variables in order to enhance the limited literature on momentary state predictors of PLWH&#8217;s prevention behaviors. Further, we used a prospective analysis strategy examining the effects of momentary states on behavior at the next daily data collection point, a novel method that strengthens causal interpretations. Additional research using EMA is needed to clarify the momentary states that are most conducive to HIV prevention behaviors.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700570"><title>Spatially variable risk factors for malaria in a geographically heterogeneous landscape, western Kenya: an explorative study</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Malaria Journal</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Tobias</first-name><last-name>Homan</last-name></author><author><first-name>Nicolas</first-name><last-name>Maire</last-name></author><author><first-name>Alexandra</first-name><last-name>Hiscox</last-name></author><author><first-name>Aurelio</first-name><last-name>Di Pasquale</last-name></author><author><first-name>Ibrahim</first-name><last-name>Kiche</last-name></author><author><first-name>Kelvin</first-name><last-name>Onoka</last-name></author><author><first-name>Collins</first-name><last-name>Mweresa</last-name></author><author><first-name>Wolfgang R.</first-name><last-name>Mukabana</last-name></author><author><first-name>Amanda</first-name><last-name>Ross</last-name></author><author><first-name>Thomas A.</first-name><last-name>Smith</last-name></author><author><first-name>Willem</first-name><last-name>Takken</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Research</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Background">Across sub-Saharan Africa, malaria remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality with up to 200 million symptomatic cases every year [Since large successes have been realized and many areas have moved into a pre-elimination phase, the epidemiology of malaria is changing [Many studies have investigated clustering and the spatial heterogeneity of malaria risk [In the present study, it is explored whether risk factors for malaria also vary over space. Household and environmental risk factors contributing to malaria prevalence were studied by means of a frequentist non-spatial risk model and clusters of elevated malaria risk were identified through scan statistics. The final aim of this study was to investigate the spatial heterogeneity in relationships between malaria prevalence and associated risk factors by Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). The added value of using this geostatistical model is explored, and the advantage compared to a standard linear regression model is evaluated.The study is embedded as part of a baseline study in a large malaria vector control trial (SolarMal) on Rusinga Island, western Kenya [</chapter><chapter title="Methods">Rusinga Island is located in Lake Victoria off the shore of western Kenya (between 0&#176;20&#8242;51.53&#8243;&#8211;0&#176;26&#8242;33.73&#8243; South, and 34&#176;13&#8242;43.19&#8243;&#8211;34&#176;07&#8242;23.78&#8243; East). The island is located in Mbita sub-county, under the administration of Homa Bay County in western Kenya (Fig.&#160;On Rusinga Island, the population is traditionally part of the Luo tribe. The principal occupation is fishing and labour associated with fishing, otherwise many of the inhabitants are involved in rain-fed subsistence agriculture. Malaria transmission occurs throughout the year, with peaks in transmission late in the rainy seasons when parasite prevalence is approximately 30&#160;% across the population [The SolarMal project is based at the Thomas Odhiambo Campus of the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (TOC-icipe) in the village of Mbita Point, one kilometre from the causeway which connects the island to the mainland. Meteorological data such as daily temperature and precipitation were obtained from the Suba meteorological field station at Rusinga Island (0&#176;24&#8242;19.28&#8243; South and 34&#176;08&#8242;51.94&#8243; East). A health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) was set up to visit every individual living on Rusinga Island three times per year. A census enumeration survey, conducted from May to July 2012 recorded 23,337 individuals residing in 6954 residential structures (henceforth termed houses) divided into 4063 economically independent households. During the census HDSS round, the coordinates of all residential structures, as well as public buildings, were recorded. Fieldworkers were equipped with mobile tablet computer devices (Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, 10.1) with in inbuilt global positioning system (GPS) receiver for the data collection. All individuals were asked to provide their full name, sex, date of birth, main occupation and their relationship to the head of household. An individual was considered eligible for participation in the study when he or she intended to live for at least 6&#160;months on the island. Data collection and handling was conducted using general structured questionnaires in the OpenHDS data collection and management platform. Data were transferred on a daily basis to a secured local server enabling researchers to work with a completely digital near real time database. Clean data were deposited in a MySQL database. During baseline studies one HDSS update survey was conducted from January to June 2013. For the rollout of the intervention the island was divided into 81 geographically contiguous clusters with 50&#8211;51 households per cluster. The households were allocated to clusters according to a travelling salesman algorithm by which the shortest imaginary route connecting every household on the island was identified. A new cluster was created after every 50&#8211;51 households [During the baseline period before the rollout of the intervention commenced, two parasitological prevalence surveys were conducted in a cross section of the study population. Households were randomly selected for inclusion in each prevalence survey to the point where 10&#160;% of the population was included. All members of selected households were informed in advance of the date and time of the survey and were invited to assemble at a public place such as a church or a school near their home for malaria testing. In total, residents of 790 randomly selected households were sampled, covering 1223 houses. The first survey examined 1822 individuals (7.8&#160;% of the total island population) and was carried out during the start of the short rainy season starting from September and finishing in November 2012. A second prevalence survey examined 1810 individuals (7.7&#160;% of the total population) and was conducted from February to April 2013. Individual body temperature was measured by means of a Braun&#8482; IRT 3020 ear thermometer. A drop of blood was obtained through a finger prick and directly tested for antigens of malaria parasites using an SD BIOLINE&#8482; Malaria Ag P.f/Pan (HRP-II/pLDH) Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT). The SD Bioline RDT kit results distinguish between infection with Besides the demographic information, Table&#160;Monitoring of mosquitoes took place across five consecutive rounds from September 2012 until June 2013, selecting 80 households per round, each time by means of a simple random sample, with replacement, of all households on the island. Mosquitoes were collected inside and outside selected households using odour-baited MM-X traps (American Biophysics Corporation, RI, USA) [A multispectral QuickBird image, taken on 17/03/2010 with a spatial resolution of 2.4&#160;m, was obtained through DigitalGlobeFor this analysis the measurements of both prevalence surveys were pooled and the mean malaria prevalence per project cluster on basis of individual RDT outcomes was analysed and mapped with smoothing using areal interpolation technique. Areal interpolation is a kriging-based interpolation method that considers involvement of polygons of different shapes [Unlike the regression analyses that are based on continuous household or individual data of project clusters (Table&#160;Stationary epidemiological risk models assume that observations are geographically independent. These &#8216;global&#8217; models assume that malaria and the coefficients of predictor variables apply to the whole island [To explore which predictor variables to include in the GWR model, a global multivariable regression (stationary model) was initially performed. In adopting the best model for explaining log transformed risk several other model features other than the best goodness-of-fit or statistical significance of predictors were looked at. Next, the assumption of normally distributed residuals of the estimated outcome (tested by the Jarque&#8211;Bera test) was tested as the model prediction function relies on normally distributed unexplained variance. The predictor variables that were included cannot have any multicollinearity in order to prevent duplication of capturing any predictive effect (indicated by a Variance Inflation Factor of &lt;7.5). Moreover, regression residuals need to be randomly distributed to make sure that observed relationships are not inflated because the observed minus the predicted values are not independent from each other [In relationships between dependent and independent variables the GWR produces local linear regression models. The coefficients in a standard linear regression model are assumed to be the same at every location, whereas regression coefficients of a GWR model are attached to each individual location, in this case the location of a central point of a cluster [A set of local goodness-of-fit statistics was derived by plotting the local RSpecial attention is given to the issue of local multicollinearity because GWR outcomes can be heavily biased, and local coefficients can become inflated if different predictor variables have similar geographical patterns [Statistical analysis and model building were performed using R software (RStudio, Inc.&#169; version 0.98.1102 package Ethical approval was obtained from the Kenyan Medical Research Institute (KEMRI); non-SSC Protocol No. 350. All participants were provided with written and oral information regarding the project aims, the ongoing demographic and entomological surveillance activities, the implementation of the intervention, and the collection and use of blood samples. Adults, mature minors and caregivers of children provided written informed consent in the local language agreeing to participation in the SolarMal project activities.</chapter><chapter title="Results">Possible hot spots of elevated malaria risk were identified by plotting the malaria prevalence per project cluster and smoothed with the areal interpolation technique (Fig.&#160;The multivariable global linear regression (GLR) model explains 26.8&#160;% (RBecause heteroscedasticity is significantly present in the GLR model, the robust p value and standard errors were used to assess the relationships of the predictor variables with malaria prevalence. Outdoor occupation is the strongest significant predictor in the model with a coefficient of 0.57 (and a p value of &lt;0.0001). Furthermore, belonging to a household with a high SES is positively associated with malaria prevalence with a significant coefficient of 0.24 (and a p value of 0.02). A third significant predictor variable is population density, although the coefficient was only &#8722;0.004 (p value of 0.001). All predictor variables in the final global model were tested for multicollinearity, and all are well below the threshold of 7.5 (Table&#160;The predictor variables of the GLR model (outdoor occupation, SES and population density) were incorporated into a geographically weighted regression model. To determine the number of neighbouring clusters for local regression the bandwidth with the lowest AICc was chosen. The bi-square adaptive kernel function looks at an adaptive number neighbours and the influence of these neighbours decays following a Gaussian distribution so that closer observations have most weight. So local regression for clusters that have few data points adjacent, will include clusters farther away. Comparing the global and the local model shows that the GWR model performs better than the GLR model with an AIC (a measure to compare model quality) value of &#8722;43.8 versus &#8722;40.2 (Table&#160;Exploring the spatial structure of the model residuals with an anisotropic averaged semivariogram shows that the distance up to which RSA occurs (the range) is 2.7&#160;km (Fig.&#160;Geographically varying effects of outdoor occupation, SES and population density in the GWR model are illustrated in Fig.&#160;Population density, outdoor occupation and highest SES differ in having a positive or negative association with malaria prevalence. Coefficients of each variable can have a positive or negative association and the direction of the association varies depending on the local values of those explanatory variables. Coefficients that are equal to one indicate a similar malaria risk compared to the surrounding comparator clusters, whereas coefficients risks above one demonstrate an increased risk for malaria. The coefficients of malaria for population density varied between 0.268 and 2.569 indicating that the association between malaria and population density could be positive or negative depending on the area of the island. The variation in coefficients of malaria for those in the highest SES group ranged between 0.841 and 1.334, also indicative of a negative association in some areas of the island but a positive association in other areas. Outdoor occupation also had a spatially variable association with malaria, with exponentiated coefficients ranging between 0.807 and 1.320. P values of regression coefficients of all three explanatory variables also vary over space (Fig.&#160;</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">Over the past decade large reductions in malaria have been achieved, yet the current distribution of malaria is still spatially heterogeneous [In exploring spatially varying relationships of risk factors for malaria, factors that are directly related to malaria risk as well as proxy factors were used. Socioeconomic status, screened eaves and condition of bed nets are examples of factors directly influencing malaria risk, whereas distance to nearest clinic and environmental variables as TWI and NDVI can have an indirect effect because of access to anti-malarials or proximity to possible breeding sites for malaria vectors. The GLR model explained 27&#160;% of the spatial variance in malaria prevalence, however GWR analysis greatly improved model fit to 69&#160;%. A better fit by the GWR model is confirmed by a reduction in the residual sum of squares as well as an increased likelihood when comparing the global and the local model (Table&#160;Outdoor occupation and activity at night have previously been associated with higher risk for malaria [Socioeconomic status has often been linked with risk of malaria. Better schooling, improved housing and a higher income are commonly associated with reduced malaria risk [Socioeconomic status itself does not affect malaria directly; hence the components of SES were further explored. It was found that in most of the clusters where high SES is associated with increased malaria risk, most farmland and dwellings are owned by the occupants while house structure is predominantly poor. This could suggest that variables as owning land and a house, indicators for being in a high SES class, do not necessarily directly relate to reduced malaria risk. Thus even though people are in the highest SES class, the house structure could allow for considerable malaria risk because there is poor protection against mosquitoes entering the house. A higher education level of the head of household could indicate that there is more financial freedom within the family. This can possibly result in a higher expenditure on health care and malaria prevention, which would presumably lead to reduced malaria risk. The components of location of kitchen and wall structure in this SES PCA are proxies of exposure to mosquitoes. When people cook outside during sunset and at night-time they may be exposed to outdoor-biting mosquitoes. Finally and interestingly SES did not have a strong (Fig.&#160;A higher population density was associated with a slightly reduced risk of malaria in the GLR model, in keeping with previous findings from various studies in both urban and rural settings in Africa [Other risk factors considered in the GLR model have all been suggested in previous literature as predictive for malaria risk. Remarkably, human age and mosquito counts as a proxy for exposure did not enter the final model. Young children (0&#8211;5&#160;years) and adolescents typically have a higher risk of malaria because of different behaviour regarding malaria prevention and less well developed immune systems [An advantage of this study is firstly the assumption that non-stationarity of underlying risk factors for malaria can improve model fit considerably and can subsequently be used to explore geographically varying factors responsible for spatial patterns of malaria. Local outcomes and relationships can shed light on why malaria persists in certain areas. Secondly, as the data collected for this analysis serves as the baseline survey for a large vector control study, this analysis can assist in exploring further research and explain why the interventions may ultimately perform better in some areas than in others. One could consider increasing the intensity of available malaria interventions near fishing beaches at night, account for poor housing structures and reduce the number of traps in a densely populated area where high population density is associated with lower risk of malaria.It is essential to understand the degree by which the results could be influenced by the unit of analysis. The use of discrete zones to perform spatial analysis is very common [Further limitations of this analysis are linked with the statistical methods used by GWR [</chapter><chapter title="Conclusion">In this study, geographically-varying risk factors for malaria were modelled. The spatial heterogeneity of malaria risk factors is explored rather than concluding upon perfect inferences. The study reveals that predictor variables for malaria vary geographically even over small distances of several kilometres. The exploration demonstrates that assuming stationarity of risk factors by means of a global statistical model ignores spatial components that can yield useful information and improve model fit. Being part of the highest SES, working outdoors (during night time) and population density were most predictive for malaria patterns on Rusinga Island. When considering SES as a risk factor for malaria one has to bear in mind that this depends on the local setting and the components included, hence results need to be interpreted with caution. All relationships with risk factors were spatially heterogeneous and these varying effects can be used to explore for what reasons vector intervention at the island possibly may have dissimilar effects in different areas.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700571"><title>LmABCB3, an atypical mitochondrial ABC transporter essential for </title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Parasites &amp; Vectors</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Marta</first-name><last-name>Mart&#237;nez-Garc&#237;a</last-name></author><author><first-name>Jenny</first-name><last-name>Campos-Salinas</last-name></author><author><first-name>Mar&#237;a</first-name><last-name>Cabello-Donayre</last-name></author><author><first-name>Estela</first-name><last-name>Pineda-Molina</last-name></author><author><first-name>Francisco J.</first-name><last-name>G&#225;lvez</last-name></author><author><first-name>Lina M.</first-name><last-name>Orrego</last-name></author><author><first-name>Mar&#237;a P.</first-name><last-name>S&#225;nchez-Ca&#241;ete</last-name></author><author><first-name>Sophie</first-name><last-name>Malagarie-Cazenave</last-name></author><author><first-name>David M.</first-name><last-name>Koeller</last-name></author><author><first-name>Jos&#233; M.</first-name><last-name>P&#233;rez-Victoria</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Research</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Background">Leishmaniasis is a complex neglected tropical disease produced by different species of the protozoan parasite Like most trypanosomatid parasites, In mammals, the mitochondrial ABC half-transporter ABCB6 has been proposed to be responsible for mitochondrial porphyrin uptake required for The genome of </chapter><chapter title="Methods">DAPI dihydrochloride, MES hydrate, Yeast synthetic drop-out medium supplements without uracil, Yeast synthetic drop-out medium supplements without tryptophan, lithium acetate dihydrate, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), dibasic potassium phosphate, monopotassium phosphate, sodium chloride, DL-dithiothreitol (threo-1,4-dimercapto-2,3-butanediol), Triton X-100 (4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phenyl-polyethylene glycol), Laemmli sample buffer, sodium hydrosulfite, PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), D-(+)-glucose, D-galactose, glycerol, lactate acid, ethanol and hemin were obtained from Sigma. 5&#8242;-fluoroorotic acid (FOA) was from Zymo Research.

In the same year, malaria accounted for approximately 584,000 deaths worldwide, representing a decline of 47&#160;% since year 2000. Africa remains the continent with the heaviest burden of malaria, accounting for about 90&#160;% of all malaria deaths in the world. It is also estimated that about 78&#160;% of all malaria deaths occur among children aged under 5&#160;years [Case management based on prompt diagnosis and adequate treatment remains a major focus of malaria control in Ghana. Other interventions include intermittent preventive treatment among pregnant women (IPTp), long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), and recently seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) [Since 2005 the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR), in collaboration with the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP), has been monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of first-line anti-malarial drugs from sentinel sites across Ghana with the view of providing continuous data to inform malaria treatment policy in the country. This paper covers the therapeutic efficacy of AS-AQ and AL across two ecological zones in Ghana during the period July 2013 to March 2014 using the 2009 WHO protocol for surveillance of anti-malarial drug efficacy [</chapter><chapter title="Methods">The study was a one-arm prospective evaluation of the clinical, parasitological, and haematological responses to directly observed therapy for uncomplicated malaria with either AS-AQ or AL among children aged 6&#160;months to 9&#160;years in sentinel sites representing the savannah and forest zones of Ghana. The primary objective of the study was to assess cure rates in the two ecological zones whilst secondary objectives were to assess patterns of fever and parasite clearance as well as changes in haemoglobin levels and gametocyte carriage rates after treatment with AS-AQ and AL.Therapeutic efficacy of AS-AQ was studied in the Yendi Municipal and Wa Regional Hospitals (representing the savannah zone) and Hohoe Municipal Hospital (representing the forest zone). Therapeutic efficacy of AL was studied in Navrongo War Memorial Hospital (representing the savannah zone) and Bekwai Municipal and Begoro District Hospitals (representing the forest zone).The Yendi Municipal is located in the Northern region of Ghana with an estimated municipal population of 117,780 and an annual average rainfall of 1125&#160;mm.

Malaria transmission in the savannah zone of Ghana is generally perennial with marked seasonal variation and an annual entomological rate of about 418 infective bites per person per year [Hohoe is located in the Volta region of Ghana with an estimated municipal population of 262,046 and an annual average rainfall of 1300&#160;mm. The rainfall pattern is bimodal with two distinct rainy seasons: April to July as major and September to November as minor. Malaria transmission in the municipality is intense and peaks with the two rainy seasons. Bekwai municipal is located in the Ashanti region of Ghana with an estimated municipal population of 118,024. Annual rainfall in the municipality is 1600&#8211;1800&#160;mm with double maxima rainfall in May and October each year. Malaria transmission in the municipality is intense and perennial.

At each follow-up visit, the children were clinically examined by a study Physician, who recorded findings on a Case Record Form (CRF). Parasitaemia levels (asexual and sexual) were assessed on days 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and any day within the 28-day follow-up period that a child is brought to the clinic with fever. Thick and thin smears were stained with 3&#160;% Giemsa for 30&#8211;45&#160;min for quantification of asexual parasites against 200 white blood cells using a hand tally counter. Sexual parasite counts were done per 1000 white blood cells. Parasitaemia levels were expressed per &#181;l blood assuming white blood cell count of 8000 per &#181;l blood. A smear was declared negative when examination of 100 thick-film fields did not show presence of asexual parasites. For quality control purposes, all blood slides were read by two qualified independent microscopists, and discordant readings were re-examined by a third qualified independent microscopist. Discordance was defined as differences between the first and second microscopists regarding presence/absence of asexual or sexual parasites; species diagnosis; and day 0 counts meeting the inclusion criterion of 1000&#8211;250,000 per &#181;l blood. The first or second reading was taken as final depending on whichever agrees with the third reading. Filter paper blots were obtained on day 0 and at recurrence of parasitaemia for PCR genotyping. Merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 (Per protocol analysis was used to assess treatment outcomes on day 28 for the two ecological zones based on the WHO 2009 criteria: Early treatment failure (ETF), Late Parasitological Failure (LPF), Late Clinical Failure (LCF), and Adequate Clinical and Parasitological Response (ACPR) [The Institutional Review Board of the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, University of Ghana, reviewed and approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained from each parent/guardian at the start of the study. Each parent/guardian was informed of the objectives, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study. They were also informed that they were at liberty to withdraw their children from the study at any time without penalty.</chapter><chapter title="Results">A cumulative total of 310 children participated in the study in the two ecological zones: 140 received AS-AQ and 170 received AL. Of the children who received AS-AQ, 81 (57.9&#160;%) were within the savannah zone. Of the children who received AL, 124 (72.9&#160;%) were in the forest zone. For both anti-malarials, there were no significant differences between the two ecological zones, in terms of male/female ratio as well as baseline mean haemoglobin levels (Tables&#160;Per protocol treatment outcomes on day 28 were assessed for a total of 278 evaluable children. Out of this, 125 received AS-AQ, and 153 received AL (Table&#160;PCR-uncorrected Kaplan&#8211;Meier survival analysis for AS-AQ showed cumulative treatment success incidence of 1.000 for the two ecological zones until day 7, when the incidence of success declined to 0.987 (95&#160;% CI 0.917, 0.999) in the savannah zone and remained 1.000 in the forest zone (p&#160;=&#160;0.895). Incidence of treatment success with AS-AQ remained 1.000 and 0.987 in the forest and savannah zones, respectively until day 21, when both zones experienced a decline to 0.981 (95&#160;% CI 0.884, 0.999) and 0.974 (95&#160;% CI 0.902, 0.996), respectively (p&#160;=&#160;0.721), and remained same between day 21 and day 28. For AL, PCR-uncorrected treatment success remained 1.000 in the two ecological zones until day 14 when cumulative incidence of treatment success declined to 0.984 (95&#160;% CI 0.936, 0.997) in the forest zone and 0.929 (95&#160;% CI 0.795, 0.981) in the savannah zone (p&#160;=&#160;0.208).

Cumulative incidence of treatment success remained 0.942 in the forest zone until day 26, when it declined to 0.934 (95&#160;% CI 0.870, 0.969), and further declined to 0.851 (95&#160;% CI 0.772, 0.907) on day 28 compared with 0.601 (95&#160;% CI 0.422, 0.766) on the same day in the savannah zone (p&#160;=&#160;0.004) (Fig.&#160;Generally, prevalence of fever decreased by about 75&#160;% after first day of treatment with each ACT (26.4&#160;%; 95&#160;% CI 19.5, 34.7 for AS-AQ and 21.4&#160;%; 95&#160;% CI 15.6, 28.6 for AL; p&#160;=&#160;0.372) (Fig.&#160;No child in the two ecological zones was parasitaemic on day 3 (Fig.&#160;Prevalence of gametocytaemia remained less than 5&#160;% during the 28-day follow-up period after treatment with AS-AQ and AL in the two ecological zones. For AS-AQ, gametocytaemia was absent in the forest zone during the entire follow-up period. Gametocytaemia in the savannah zone was 1.3&#160;% (95&#160;% CI 0.1, 7.7) on days 2 and 3 after treatment with AS-AQ, and remained absent from day 7 to day 28. For AL, gametocytaemia in the forest zone declined from 3.3&#160;% (95&#160;% CI 1.1, 8.6) on day zero to 0.9&#160;% (0.1, 5.5) on day 28 (p&#160;=&#160;0.413), and was present only on day 7 (2.4&#160;%; 95&#160;% CI 0.1, 4.4) in the savannah zone.Mean haemoglobin concentration in the forest zone significantly increased from 8.7 (&#177;1.0) at baseline to 9.2 (&#177;0.8) on day 28 after treatment with AS-AQ (p&#160;=&#160;0.006).

The two drugs were effective in clearing fever and parasites as well as maintaining gametocytaemia at low rates (less than 5&#160;%), and improving post-treatment mean haemoglobin levels. Artemisinin is still efficacious in Ghana by virtue of the absence of parasitaemia on day 3 post-treatment.

The National Health Directory listed 34,173 health facilities in Nigeria at December 2011 [Studies have indicated the inherent differences in healthcare practices across the different health sectors (private vs public) and even within the same sector [In light of the dearth of knowledge on the status of RDT use in the formal private health sector in Nigeria, this study was undertaken to identify practices related to the use of RDT in private health facilities. With lessons learnt from the surveys in the public health sector and informal private sector, it was expected that the findings from this study on formal private health facilities would complete the loop of understanding needed to guide continued deployment and use of RDTs in the country. Improved diagnosis will contribute to better treatment of malaria, thereby contributing further to reduction in malaria mortality and better tracking of progress made.</chapter><chapter title="Methods">This was a cross-sectional study to assess RDT use and its associated challenges in formal private health facilities in Nigeria. Formal private health facilities were defined as hospitals, clinics or maternity homes registered by the state ministry of health (SMOH) as a private health facility offering orthodox medical care. This excludes health facilities registered primarily as pharmacy/patent and proprietary medicine vendors and/or for laboratory services. State Hospital Management Boards register, regulate and license private health facilities. For the purpose of this study, only private hospitals were enrolled.Nigeria is a West African country with 36 states and 774 Local Government Areas (LGAs) and Federal Capital Territory (FCT). For administrative convenience and representation, the country uses geo-political zoning, comprising northcentral (six states and the FCT); northeast (six states); northwest (six states); southeast (five states); southsouth (six states and southwest (six states). Malaria transmission has been intense, stable and holo-endemic in most parts of the country. Recent reports suggest some changes over time, such that as at 2010, 85&#160;% of Nigerians lived in areas supporting meso-endemic transmission, 15&#160;% lived under conditions of hyper-holo-endemicity, with some areas within FCT and northeastern states supporting hypo-endemicity [The study was designed to determine the prevalence of fever, the practices related to RDT use, and to understand the perception of a sample of health workers to RDT. It was anticipated that there could be significant variations in the quality of health facility records, thereby limiting their aggregation to answer the research questions. Three sets of tools were designed to address the study objectives:Health facility records: this was to focus on the record of illness episodes as documented in order to establish the proportion of complaints that were fever. The facility interview focused on attendance rate and proportion of fever cases over the preceding 6 months of the study. Information on the facility stock level, utilization of malaria commodities, supply chain management system, state of infrastructure and challenges encountered was also captured in the questionnaires. The records were extracted from National Health Management Information registers provided with support from the Global Fund through SFH or any other hospital register where these were not available.Healthcare workers&#8217; interviews conducted to appraise the practices of the health facilities as reported by the health workers. Data were collected from the officers-in-charge or health personnel that dispense diagnostics.Exit interview of febrile patients: aimed at systematically and prospectively collating perceptions of patients regarding RDT at the private health facilities. In addition, it was expected to provide a reliable denominator to facilitate the estimates related to level of diagnosis and compliance with test results.The health facilities were selected using a multi-staged, random sampling technique. In the first stage, six states were randomly selected using geo-political zones as sampling frames viz; Cross-River in mangrove ecological zone, Enugu and Lagos in rain forest, Kaduna in sudan-savannah), Kwara and Ogun in guinea-savannah. States in the northeast geo-political zone were excluded on account of security reasons, and Lagos State was selected because of its coastal location and status as emerging mega city. In each selected state, two LGAs (one urban and one rural) were randomly selected. From each of the selected LGAs, the health facilities were selected by simple random sampling from a sampling frame of the list of registered private health facilities obtained from the SMOH. Twenty private health facilities were selected from each LGA. In cases where there were less than 20 private health facilities available in a selected LGA, data were collected from health facilities in a contiguous LGA to complete the sample size. Thus, data were collected from a total of 240 private health facilities across the country (Fig.&#160;Preliminary activities consisted of meetings between the Principal Investigator (PI), State team leaders and other key members of the study team to fine-tune the data capture tools and data analysis methods. Data collection tools comprised questionnaires to capture previous medical records, to ascertain hospital attendance and proportion of febrile patients tested and treated appropriately, and exit interview questionnaires to validate reported practice and community perception of RDT. The questionnaires were pre-tested in health facilities in the Federal capital city where the study would not be carried out and observations made during the pilot informed revision of the final data capture tools.At each study site, the study team comprised the team leader, six interviewers, the state epidemiologist, state malaria programme officer and malaria focal persons at the two LGAs. Field statisticians were assigned, one each, by NMEP to various study sites. A two-day training workshop was organized at each site prior to commencement of field work. During the workshops, the state team members were familiarized with the objectives of the study and introduced to the data capture tools. Ethical clearance for the study was obtained from the National Health Research and Ethics Committee (NHREC).Data were collected using study instruments over 22&#160;days in each state from July to August 2014. Data collected were reviewed and cleaned each day by the state team leaders and field statisticians, who subsequently entered data in computer. At the end of data collection in each state, the field statisticians sent their data set to the central study statistician for pooled entry.Data entry was done using EPI info version 3.5.4. There was onsite data entry by each of the team data management officers. Thereafter, data from the states were merged to create a common database. Simple frequencies were generated to facilitate the process of data cleaning. Queries were generated and clarifications sought from the respective teams as applicable. The cleaned dataset was subsequently exported to SPSS version 22 for analysis.
Frequency tables and charts were used to present simple proportions with 95&#160;% confidence intervals (CI) using the online VassarstatThis study did not address quality assurance of malaria diagnostics in the private sector. Record keeping was generally poor precluding a comparison of the data extracted from the registers among the study sites. The decision to use mainly the exit survey in defining denominators for the various measurements was informed by the anticipation of this possibility.</chapter><chapter title="Results">The study was conducted using three instruments: summary of medical records, exit interviews and key health staff interviews. The flow of data collection is summarized in Fig.&#160;
Data of hospital registers from 240 healthcare facilities were assessed to determine prevalence of fever among hospital consultations; 39 incomplete records (Kwara: 27, Kaduna: 7, Cross-River: 3 and Ogun: 2) were excluded; data were analysed for 201 health facilities (Fig.&#160;
Concomitant symptoms: A total of 2077 exit interviews were conducted for febrile patients across the study sites (Fig.&#160;Use of malaria diagnostics: Out of the 2077 febrile patients, 1533 had their blood tested during the hospital visit (Fig.&#160;
Reported compliance with test results: Compliance was computed from the total of those positive for malaria that had ACT and those negative for malaria that did not receive ACT/anti-malarial expressed as a proportion of the total tested. Findings in this regard showed that of 1078 patients whose malaria test results were reported positive, 892 (82.7&#160;%) received ACT while out of 181 patients whose malaria tests were reported as negative, 126 (69.6&#160;%) did not receive ACT. Thus, &#8216;compliance&#8217; to malaria test result in administering ACT was 80.9&#160;% (95&#160;% CI 78.7&#8211;83.0&#160;%). The compliance was 75&#160;% in Enugu and consistently above 80&#160;% in all the other states with Kwara having the highest at 87&#160;% (Table&#160;Two-hundred and forty health workers were interviewed in order to triangulate their information with what was obtained in the exit interviews so as to understand practices within the health facilities in relation to malaria diagnosis and treatment. The distribution of respondents shows that the majority were doctors 69 (29.1&#160;%), followed by nurses 51 (21.5&#160;%), medical laboratory scientists 50 (21.1&#160;%), auxiliary nurses 31 (13.1&#160;%), community health extension workers 26 (11.0&#160;%), community health workers 7 (3.0&#160;%) while pharmacists, 3 (1.3&#160;%), were least represented.Health facilities with knowledgeable health workers: Among the 240 health workers, 70.0&#160;% knew the meaning of RDT, while 84.5&#160;% knew what RDT assesses. Of the 229 that responded to the question on specimen used for RDT, 210 (91.7&#160;%) knew that blood was used for the test, one (0.4&#160;%) said urine was used for the test while 18 (7.9&#160;%) did not know the specimen used for the test. Of the 223 respondents to the question on how to carry out RDTs, 160 (71.7&#160;%) knew how to carry out RDT while 63 (28.3&#160;%) did not know. Practices of health workers were equally assessed. In 87.8&#160;% (95&#160;% CI 82&#8211;92&#160;%) of health workers, results of RDT were available at the time of treating patient. The result of RDT was used in 73.7&#160;% (95&#160;% CI 67&#8211;79&#160;%) to determine treatment. Reported mean time for performing RDT was 11.9 [standard deviation (SD) 7.7] minutes. The mean amount paid for the test was N375 (SD 175), an equivalent of $2.5 as at the time of the study. Perception-wise: 75&#160;% (95&#160;% CI 73&#8211;85&#160;%) of health workers were of the opinion that RDT was useful in their facilities. In addition, the majority reported it took a short time, was easy to conduct, and that it did not interfere with clinic activities (Table&#160;</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">Fever prevalence from the health facilities&#8217; records was 38.5&#160;%. The prevalence varied from 28 to 47&#160;% across the various geo-political zones of the country. The fever prevalence in this study is lower than previously reported rate of 60&#160;% among outpatients [Among the 2077 patients with fever, there were a number of concomitant symptoms. The most frequent being generalized weakness, cough, vomiting, and diarrhoea. The predictive importance of the individual symptoms in relation to malaria was not undertaken in this study. However, the combination of these features continues to underscore the challenge of developing a reliable clinical algorithm for the diagnosis of malaria. Most efforts in this regard have resulted in relatively poor sensitivity and specificity, making the diagnosis of malaria solely reliant on parasitological testing [This study showed that about three-quarters, 73.8&#160;% (95&#160;% CI 71.9&#8211;75.7&#160;%) of fever cases were tested for malaria in private health facilities in Nigeria. This is much higher than testing rates reported in public health facilities in the country [A further possible reason for the high testing rate in private health facilities could be motivation for income generation, fear of litigation or simply an adherence to policy/practice regulation. Anecdotal evidence in informal medical discourse in Nigeria favours the notion that, because of economic gain, private practitioners are &#8216;quick on the draw&#8217; to order tests for care-seekers. That said, the outcome of this study regarding the status of testing for malaria before treatment in private health facilities is commendable.Testing with RDTs was not observed to be as common as testing by microscopy, which, although considered the gold standard, requires more stringent conditions [The high rate of test-before-treatment practice in the private facilities was also complimented by a high level of compliance to the result of the malaria test. This study&#8217;s composite measure of &#8216;compliance&#8217; to appropriate treatment with ACT following malaria test result was a high 80.9&#160;% (95&#160;% CI 78.7&#8211;83.0&#160;%), inclusive of those whose tests were negative and were not given ACT. The level of compliance was not affected by type of test or age of patients. There is virtually no parallel national study to compare this important finding with, except the NDHS household-based surveys reporting that 6.0&#160;% of children under five with fever were appropriately given ACT, irrespective of test-result status or the health provider type [The spread of cadre of health workers reported in the present study is similar to that reported by Uzochukwu et al. [The perception of the usefulness of RDT for malaria diagnosis and treatment among health workers in the private facilities was favourable. The perceived usefulness of the RDT test for diagnosis by the health workers in this study was 79.5&#160;% (95&#160;% CI 73&#8211;85&#160;%) against 65.6&#160;% previously reported [Regardless of the point of care, when health providers adhere to or comply with malaria test results, it is expected that there will be a lot of benefit to the health systems, the patients and the health facilities.</chapter><chapter title="Conclusions">This study revealed an unprecedented report of the status of malaria testing rate, and compliance with malaria test results in private health facilities in Nigeria. In formal private health facilities in Nigeria, there is a high rate of malaria testing for febrile patients, high level of compliance with test results but relatively low level of RDT utilization. This calls for improved engagement of the formal private health sector with a view to achieving universal coverage targets on malaria testing.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700574"><title /><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Malaria Journal</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Sai Lata</first-name><last-name>De</last-name></author><author><first-name>Danielle I.</first-name><last-name>Stanisic</last-name></author><author><first-name>Fabian</first-name><last-name>Rivera</last-name></author><author><first-name>Michael R.</first-name><last-name>Batzloff</last-name></author><author><first-name>Christian</first-name><last-name>Engwerda</last-name></author><author><first-name>Michael F.</first-name><last-name>Good</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Methodology</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Background">Malaria continues to be a leading cause of mortality in endemic countries, despite control and eradication initiatives, such as the use of insecticide-treated bed nets and anti-malaria drug treatment [Various assays using specific antibodies to parasite antigens have been employed [The enzyme pLDH is a soluble, energy-producing enzyme that is involved in the last step of the glycolytic pathway [Previously, monoclonal antibodies specific for pLDH have been used to determine the sensitivity of The pLDH amino acid sequence has a 90&#160;% sequence identity amongst all human This study investigated the use of a commercial human </chapter><chapter title="Methods">Female BALB/c mice aged 4&#8211;6 weeks were purchased from the Animal Resource Centre (ARC) (Canning Vale, Perth, Australia) and maintained under appropriate ARC and Griffith University conditions.

Amongst different forms of nystagmus, the downbeat nystagmus syndrome (DBN) is a frequent central type fixation nystagmus [DBN intensity can be reduced in slightly over 50&#160;% of patients [In this study, we investigated the effects of real-time visual feedback on the improvement of text reading measured by an increase in VA. Using a computer-assisted device (gaze-contingent-display) and an infrared video oculography system (EyeSeeCam&#174;) [For the first time however, our aim was to stabilize the retinal image without the use of a magnetic search coil or an optical device. Therefore, we adopted a thoroughly different approach, without the need of any invasive procedures (coils or contact lenses) using a basically mobile set-up, though limited to a computer screen.</chapter><chapter title="Methods">Patients with DBN were included in this prospective study regardless of the etiology or the duration of visual symptoms (for clinical detail see Table&#160;VA was measured by a standard orthoptic exam (Snellen chart, CC &#8220;cum correctione&#8221;) and using the EyeSeeCam&#174; system during a static condition and dynamic feedback condition (Fig.&#160;VA was measured in multiple trials based on the correct identification of the Landolt C optotype orientation. The Landolt C was designed according to standard guidelines (NAS-NRC, 1980) [The eye movement velocity was calculated using a numerical three-point differentiation of the eye position and a Gaussian low-pass filtering with a corner frequency of 30Hz. The high-frequency velocity peaks of the nystagmus&#8217; quick phases, saccades and blink artifacts were removed from the eye velocity using an absolute acceleration threshold of 700&#176;/s^2 and a subsequent floating median filter with a time window of 0.5&#160;s. Finally, SPV was calculated as the median during the presentation of the stimulus on a predefined position.Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (V 22, IBM Corp.). We applied the Shapiro-Wilk test to determine, whether the slow phase nystagmus velocity data were normally distributed. One-way ANOVA was used for comparison.</chapter><chapter title="Results">Ten Patients with DBN (4 male) with different etiologies were included in the study (cerebellar atrophy (The mean slow phase velocity (SPV) was moderate during gaze straight ahead (1.44&#176;/s, SD +/- 1.18&#176;/s). As one would expect, SPV increased significantly in sideward gaze (Fig.&#160;Comparison of gaze induced changes in DBN correlated strongly with improvements in VA during the feedback-driven condition (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.73, </chapter><chapter title="Discussion">This study investigated the effect of real-time visual feedback using a computer-assisted device on VA in ten patients with DBN syndrome. The major findings of this study were as follows: first, there was no effect on VA during gaze straight ahead, probably due to a low baseline SPV. This applied to patients with high or low SPV in gaze straight ahead. There were four patients with a SPV &gt;1&#176;/s, however there was also no improvement after giving visual feedback in gaze straight ahead. Second, in sideward gaze however, VA improved significantly. If there was a decrease in VA in the static condition in sideward gaze compared to gaze straight ahead, the loss of VA could be compensated by the dynamic visual feedback. If there was no decrease in VA during sideward gaze, there was no improvement in VA accordingly.Looking at the difference in SPV between gaze straight ahead and in sideward gaze, there is no striking difference in VA during the static condition.The reason might be a central compensation mechanism for an unstable visual perception due to oscillopsia, which prevents a strong decline in VA. The central compensation mechanism could be further addressed by long-term analysis of acute lesions leading to visual impairment due to nystagmus because of a stroke or in multiple sclerosis. A sudden decrease in VA due to an acute lesion leading to an unstable visual field could reveal the effectiveness of our setup. However, visual impairment and difficulties in reading texts reduce the quality of life and even the capability to work, especially in an increasingly computerized working environment.A further problem may consist of technical reasons. A stable visual field is inherently necessary for an adequate VA. As there is a slight offset when the eye jumps back on target after the downward saccade, another corrective saccade is needed to refixate the target, if the latter does not match the previous retinal image. As mentioned above, the Landolt C was shown in a predefined area of 7.5&#176; to limit the ocular offset. However, it cannot be ruled out that there occurred a retinal error fostering an unstable perception and therefore limiting the effectiveness of the feedback compensation.Effects of the positive influence of retinal image stabilization on VA have been previously reported [Looking at the results of a study investigating the effect of the drug 4-aminopyridine on VA in DBN syndrome, we can find an improvement of mean VA of 0.07 (from 0.59 to 0.66) in gaze straight ahead with a responder rate of 57&#160;%, i.e. 57&#160;% of patients responded successfully to treatment with 4-aminopyridine by reducing the nystagmus [The question arises why there is only a subtle effect in gaze straight ahead using our visual feedback device. As already mentioned above, the reason could be that a central compensation mechanism already compensated for the oscillopsia, which persisted for years (mean duration of symptoms 6.3&#160;years). Furthermore, the reason could be technical. It is possible that the lack of stability of the visual field could explain the poor VA in our experimental setup as well as the minor improvements. However, an even more unstable perception should even further decrease the VA.Given our findings and other studies using 4-aminopyridine, we can assume that there actually is an improvement in VA after reduction of SPV, as the VA correlated with the improvement of SPV.For investigating our experimental setup and proof of concept, our cohort can be considered sufficient. Further studies are needed to investigate these findings in a larger patient group.</chapter><chapter title="Conclusions">This study provides proof of concept that real-time computer-based visual feedback compensates for the SPV in DBN and therefore improves VA. So far, our findings are limited to the mere testing of VA using the Landolt C in patients with chronic DBN. Further studies will have to investigate our results in acute lesions and larger patient cohorts. The novelty of our research was the different technical approach by application of a non-invasive setup using the EyeSeeCam</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700577"><title>Leprosy in Denmark 1980&#8211;2010: a review of 15 cases</title><article-type>case-report</article-type><journal-title>BMC Research Notes</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Huma</first-name><last-name>Aftab</last-name></author><author><first-name>Susanne D.</first-name><last-name>Nielsen</last-name></author><author><first-name>Ib C.</first-name><last-name>Bygbjerg</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Case Report</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Background">Comparative genomics indicates that leprosy originated in Eastern Africa or the Near East, and was spread by human migration to rest of the world. Leprosy was well-recognized in ancient India and China since 4000 BC with the first known written reference to the disease 600 BC. Leprosy is believed to have arrived in Ireland through trade and commerce with the Far East and travelled to Scandinavia through the Vikings; however, some believe that the crusaders brought the disease to Europe from where it spread to the Americas [The vast majority of infected individuals never develop clinically detectable symptoms and signs. Age and sex are important risk factors for developing leprosy: adolescents aged 10&#8211;19 and persons aged 30 or above are the most susceptible. Adult men are twice as likely to develop the infection as adult women [Today, in Scandinavia, as in most of Europe, leprosy remains non- autochthonous, brought to the region by immigrants from endemic areas, thus explaining its rarity: In Denmark less than one case per year has been reported during the last 30&#160;years, and the leprosy situation in Denmark was last reviewed more than 20-years-ago [The aim of our study was to give a brief overview of the history and of the current general knowledge on leprosy and conduct a retrospective review of leprosy cases from 1980 to 2010 in Denmark with emphasis on clinical characteristics and therapeutic challenges.Leprosy is a chronic granulomatous infection caused by the intracellular acid fast bacilli The bacilli exhibit tropism for histiocytes and Schwann cells, causing anaesthetic skin lesions, and sensorimotor function loss [Even though The wide spectrum of clinical presentations reflects the complexity of the immune response towards the causative agent and is graded according to the widely used Ridley&#8211;Jopling scheme, which is primarily based on the immunological characteristics. Clinical and histo-pathological characteristics are also considered, and delineated as two stable polar forms ranging from polar tuberculoid (TT) to polar lepromatous leprosy (LL), and in between the unstable borderline forms: borderline tuberculoid (BT), borderline leprosy (BB) and borderline lepromatous leprosy (BL). Thus, tuberculoid leprosy (T) refers to TT and BT while lepromatous leprosy forms (L) to BB, BL and LL. Borderline types are more likely to down- or upgrade through immunological reactions; type 1 reactions [The clinico-pathological features in leprosy are the result of a varying immune response. Thus, T by mounting a strong cell mediated immune response restricts the infection to a single or few well demarcated, dry (anhydrosis) and scaly anaesthetic skin lesions (macules, plaques) with an elevated margin and central healing. The skin changes are often hypopigmented in dark skin and red/coppery coloured in lighter skin. Although early and significant nerve enlargement is common in T, and the most commonly affected nerves (most common one or few asymmetric nerve affections) are posterior tibial, ulnar, median, lateral popliteal, facial, and radial nerves (may also be affected in L), thickening of the cutaneous nerves close to the skin lesion is an important diagnostic clue.T lesions are dominated by CD4+ cells, histologically characterized by well-defined granulomas consisting of lymphocytes, epitheloid and giant cells and virtually no bacilli [L lesions are characterized by few T lymphocytes with a predominance of CD8+ cells, no granulomas, diffuse infiltration of undifferentiated &#8216;foamy&#8217; macrophages and loads of bacilli, i.e. multibacillary. The epidermis stays intact until late stages of the disease. In contrast to the immune response seen in T, L lesions formed during the Th2 type response contain transcripts for IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10, are non-reactive to the Lepromin test and show high anti-M. leprae antibody titres which do not seem to convey any protection [The unresponsiveness to According to WHO diagnostic criteria, a person with one of the two cardinal signs: (1) positive skin smear However, a considerable amount of patients will be misclassified with risk of both over- and undertreatment. Therefore, if not used in the field for operational purposes, experts recommend classifying patients according to the Ridley&#8211;Jopling scheme. Thus, whenever possible, a patient suspected of leprosy should undergo examination for the three cardinal signs of leprosy: (1) thorough inspection of the skin for leprosy lesions (morphology described above) and anaesthesia (light touch, pin prick and temperature) of such, (2) enlargement with Skin biopsies are usually performed when there is doubt about the diagnosis and remain the golden standard. Biopsies should be taken from an &#8216;active&#8217; site i.e. red, enlarged and infiltrated. A modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain, such as the Wade Fite stain is preferable for the histological diagnosis. The histopathological characteristics of T and L are described above. According to WHO, only leprosy bacilli which appear as solid acid fast rods are viable while dead leprosy bacilli stain irregularly; this can aid in assessing the treatment effect.The Lepromin test is analogous to the tuberculin test used in tuberculosis. It relies on the host&#8217;s ability to mount a delayed hypersensitivity reaction after an intradermal injection of Serological tests are under development but are not used routinely due to their low sensitivity in patients at the tuberculoid pole, and have shown false positive reactions in non-leprosy patients [PCR for The WHO MDT for leprosy has proven to be highly effective and should be the first choice for all patients. Patients with up to five skin lesions and/or no bacilli (PB) are treated for 6&#160;months with daily dapsone and monthly rifampicin, while multibacillary (MB) cases with more than six skin lesions and abundant bacilli should undergo a 12&#160;months course of daily dapsone and clofazimine supplemented by monthly rifampicin and clofazimine [Severe haemolysis can follow dapsone treatment in patients with Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Dapsone should therefore be avoided in these patients. An adverse effect of clofazimine which doctors should be aware of, since it can lead to poor compliance, is reddish discoloration of the skin, conjunctivae and body excretions such as sputum and urine.Second line agents, ofloxacin and minocycline can be used in a single dose regimen for PB cases; Rifampicin-Ofloxacin-Minocycline, &#8216;ROM,&#8217; for patients with a single leprosy skin lesion. This regimen was introduced by WHO in 1998 and should only be administered after careful examination of the skin making sure the patient only has one lesion and no nerve involvement. Since ROM has proven to be less effective than MDT for treatment of PB cases with more than one skin lesion, it is currently not recommended for PB cases presenting with 2&#8211;5 skin lesions [Around 30&#160;% of borderline cases experience type 1 [Type 2 reactions, erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) are mainly seen in BL and LL patients of whom 50&#160;% (the 50&#160;% refers to the subpolar LL group which is immunologically unstable compared to the LL polar form) are at risk of experiencing this complication. ENL is a type III immune response brought about by the inflammatory reaction towards immune-complexes. The immune-complexes deposited in various organ systems cause fever, erythematous painful nodules, uveitis, neuritis, arthritis and orchitis [Severe ENL can be life threatening and require prolonged immunosuppressive treatment. WHO recommend corticosteroids 1&#160;mg/Kg body weight for 12&#160;weeks. In case of severe ENL not responding to corticosteroid, clofazimine a corticosteroid sparing agents can be used; according to WHO guidelines clofazimine should be started at 100&#160;mg, three times a day for maximum 12&#160;weeks, where after it should be tapered to 100&#160;mg twice a day for 12&#160;weeks and then 100&#160;mg once a day for 12&#8211;24&#160;weeks. Clofazimine is more effective than thalidomide for prevention of ENL recurrences. Thalidomide in doses of 100&#8211;400&#160;mg/day have shown to be effective in controlling the reaction, but more and larger trials are needed to prove its efficacy [The time frame is important when distinguishing between relapse and leprosy reactions: New elements or nerve affection appearing less than 3&#160;years after a successful course of MDT is more likely to be a reaction. However, the final diagnosis will depend on presence or not of bacilli. According to WHO a relapse in a MB case is defined as &#8220;Although co-infection with HIV does not seem to shift the patients towards the L pole, some studies indicate an increased incidence of type 1 reactions in patients receiving anti-retroviral treatment, probably as part of an immune reconstitution syndrome [</chapter><chapter title="Methods">Leprosy is a mandatory notifiable disease in Denmark. Based on social security numbers, and retrieved from the national surveillance service database at Statens Serum Institut (SSI) leprosy cases reported in the period January, 1980 to December, 2010 were reviewed. Additionally, we searched the patient register at University Hospital of Copenhagen, Rigshospitalet which is the main referral hospital for tropical diseases in Denmark. For elaboration on medical history, clinical presentation, diagnostic procedures and treatment, medical records, photographs and letters from these and other notifying hospitals were collected.Permission to obtain information about leprosy cases was granted by the Danish National Board of Health (Additional file </chapter><chapter title="Case presentation">From 1980 to 2010, 17 cases of leprosy were reported to SSI and five additional cases were identified in the Rigshospitalet patient register. Only 14 of 22 journals were available. One of the cases had been suspected for leprosy, but this was never confirmed. This left us with 13 available medical records of confirmed cases. For two patients, information was collected from letters, photographs and personal correspondence with the attending physician. Thus, in total, information on 15 leprosy patients was reviewed.The available data were reviewed with focus on demographic data, clinical findings, diagnostic procedures and treatment. The results of these findings are summarized in Table&#160;Leprosy was predominately imported to Denmark from South- and Southeast Asia (87&#160;%), in particular India, The Philippines and Cambodia, all areas where leprosy is endemic; only two cases originated from African countries. Age of patients ranged from 5 to 74&#160;years, and 11 of 15 patients (73&#160;%) debuted in their second or third decade of life. The youngest patient (5-years-old) was a girl who had most probably contracted the infection from her father, who had been treated for leprosy in Nepal.Three patients (20&#160;%) recalled exposure to leprosy. Five patients (33&#160;%) were diagnosed and had also undergone treatment for leprosy before migrating to Denmark, while one patient (7&#160;%) was defined as a relapse after consulting a leprologist in London.Diagnosis was based on travel history, clinical and pathological findings. Most patients were classified according to the Ripley and Jopling scheme. Among the 15 patients 53&#160;% were classified as borderline leprosy types evenly distributed along the spectrum, whilst 33 and 7&#160;% were classified as TT and LL respectively. Duration of symptoms varied from 3&#160;weeks to 8&#160;years, but it was only possible to deduce the length of delay in diagnosis from a few medical records since the date of the first contact with a medical professional was rarely mentioned. For the few for whom the dates were available, the time period from contact with a doctor to suspicion of leprosy was only a few weeks.Common clinical features were hypopigmentation, slightly dark reddish/brown skin lesions (macules, nodules and plaques), hyposensitivity/anaesthesia of skin lesions, nerve enlargement and palsy, in particular the ulnar and peroneal nerves. Approximately 73&#160;% of cases presented with the two cardinal signs: anaesthetic skin lesions and peripheral nerve thickening. The most common symptom bringing the patient in contact with health authorities was skin changes mimicking conditions such as sarcoidosis and pityriasis versicolor. Initially, two leprosy cases (13&#160;%) were, based on the histo-pathological finding of granulomatous skin changes, mistaken for sarcoidosis.According to the records available, slit skin smears were performed in seven of the 15 patients (47&#160;%), and the results recorded in six (40&#160;%). The patients from whom skin smears were not obtained were all classified as TT/BT cases. Skin biopsies were obtained from all patients, often on the suspicion of other dermatological disease (Fig.&#160;Four of the 15 patients (27&#160;%) experienced a type 1 reaction of which two were classified as borderline lepromatous and diagnosed as downgrading reactions before initiation of leprosy treatment while the remaining presented with type 1 reaction symptoms shortly after initiation of leprosy treatment. The patients with downgrading type 1 reactions displayed the following symptoms: appearance of new anaesthetic skin elements and signs of increased inflammation of the existing ones. Both patients were feverish, one of them with increased C- reactive protein and neutrocytosis. Arthralgia and dactylitis were also present in both cases, while only one of them developed nerve palsy (drop foot). One patient experienced a type 1 reaction shortly after treatment initiation in Cameroun, before arriving in Denmark; the only symptom mentioned in the medical records regarding this was nerve palsy (peroneus paralysis). Half of the patients experiencing a type 1 reaction were treated with corticosteroids.The patients reacting with ENL (13&#160;%) were BL/LL patients experiencing fever, universal lymphadenitis, flaring of skin elements in the form of inflamed noduli on the upper extremities. One had enlargement of the ulnar and auriuclaris magnus nerves, which was treated with a 1&#160;week thalidomide course while the other received prednisolone due to systemic symptoms with haematuria.Most common complication/sequelae were decreased sensibility, particularly on the peripheral extremities, ulcers and secondary infections due to neuropathy, as well as keratosis and atrophy of fingers and toes. These patients were referred to an orthopaedist and/or orthopaedic surgeon for evaluation and treatment. Two patients had undergone amputation of fingers/toes, in total grade 2 disability (G2D) was recorded for three patients (20&#160;%). One of three patients with G2D had the amputations done in Cameroun, while another had received several years of leprosy treatment in Thailand, and had been living with G2D for some time when a new reaction (ENL) brought him to a physician in Denmark; bringing G2D to 6&#160;% in our patient sample.Some patients experienced improvement of their sensory disturbances during treatment but none had complete remission.Skin lesion with findings of granulomatous changes in skin biopsies often led to the suspicion of sarcoidosis. Other differential diagnoses mentioned were mostly dermatological: acne, pityriasis versicolor, erythema multiforme and Sweets syndrome.All patients, diagnosed with leprosy after 1982, when WHO launched the use of MDT, received this regimen. Duration of treatment varied and was not for all cases in accordance with WHO recommendations. Some received prolonged MDT (up to 12&#160;years) due to continued presence of bacilli in skin samples, despite clinical improvement.</chapter><chapter title="Conclusion">Leprosy remains a sporadic disease imported to Denmark. With less than one case detected per year it remains difficult for doctors in non-endemic countries to recognize or even to think of leprosy, which may lead to delay of diagnosis and treatment [According to some leprologists there is a predominance of male leprosy patients after puberty, this was also the case in our patient sample. Skin smears were not performed in 53&#160;% of the patients and although these were classified as TT/BT cases not expected to be skin smear positive, skin smears should be performed in all patients suspected for leprosy. Only one patient could recall close contact to an infectious leprosy patient in the household.Skin biopsies, perhaps because of diagnostic uncertainty, were performed in all patients. Demonstration of acid fast bacilli was not possible in seven of the 15 (60&#160;%) skin biopsies; therefore exposure, travel history and clinical presentation were essential to supplement histology. The more sensitive PCR for Classification of the disease is important for several reasons: borderline patients are unstable and at risk of experiencing type 1 reaction that can lead to serious nerve damage, while lepromatous and borderline lepromatous leprosy is associated with type 2 reactions which often are complicated by systemic effects. Both these conditions require corticosteroids and close monitoring of the clinical course due to the tendency to recur causing further damage [Due to the long incubation period, the diagnosis should be kept in mind when encountering patients from endemic areas displaying dermatological or neurological symptoms even years after immigration. Special attention and care should be given to detection and treatment of complications, in particular to those with neuropathy, which can be lasting. Anaesthetic skin lesions, which were the most common clinical finding in our review, should lead to a high suspicion of leprosy.</chapter><chapter title="Consent">The Danish National Board of Health granted permission to publish this case report.

While the political argument for the importance of policy acceptability is less applicable to adolescents, as they are not yet voters, the policy effectiveness argument may be especially relevant for adolescents. Adolescents are developing their own identity, opinions and ideas [It is therefore critical to understand how adolescents themselves feel about various possible intervention strategies to improve healthy diets, which types of strategies they find acceptable and which not. In the current study, we investigate the extent to which adolescents accept ten possible strategies aimed at improving their eating behavior. Three research questions will be addressed: (1) To what extent do adolescents accept various intervention strategies; (2) can single strategies be clustered into meaningful categories; and (3) which individual and behavioral characteristics are associated with acceptance for these clusters of intervention strategies.</chapter><chapter title="Methods">This study was conducted as part of the &#8220;Temptations to Eat Moderated by Personal and Environmental Self-regulatory Tools&#8221; (TEMPEST) project undertaken in nine European countries.

In Poland, the International Review Board &#8211; KEBE of the University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Warsaw granted approval, and in Portugal approval was granted by the ethics committee of the S&#227;o Jo&#227;o Hospital Centre. In The Netherlands the Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects indicated that ethics approval did not have to be sought for this study. Consent (active or passive, depending on country regulations) for participation was sought from parents or caregivers. Specifically, active parental or caregiver consent was sought in Poland, while passive consent was sought in the UK and The Netherlands. In Portugal, internal school regulations differed on whether active or passive consent should be obtained, and both approaches were used in this country following each school&#8217;s guidelines. In all countries, assent was obtained from the respondents on the day of the study by informing the pupils that they were free to decide if they wanted to participate in the study or not. Respondents could discontinue participation at any time. Respondents filled out the questionnaire during class hours and in their regular class setting.

Third, a paired samples </chapter><chapter title="Results">Descriptive statistics of the sample are depicted in Table&#160;Across all ten strategies, mean endorsement was slightly above the mid-point of a five-point scale ranging from 1 to 5 (To determine whether the strategies could be clustered into meaningful categories based on the acceptability ratings, a principal component analysis with orthogonal (varimax) rotation was performed. Bartlett&#8217;s test of sphericity (Having established two clear categories of intervention strategies, we proceeded to investigate which individual and behavioral characteristics (age, gender, country, overweight status, family affluence, immigrant status, and healthy and unhealthy food intake) were associated with acceptability of the two categories of strategies. The results (see Table&#160;</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">This study investigated adolescents&#8217; acceptance of intervention strategies aimed at improving their eating behavior. While previous studies have investigated the extent to which adults accept interventions targeted at adolescents, research into the extent to which adolescents themselves find such interventions acceptable is scarce. Overall, adolescents rated the strategies as neither acceptable nor unacceptable, but acceptability was higher among younger adolescents, girls, overweight or obese adolescents, immigrant adolescents and those with healthier average daily food intake (as evidenced by higher intake of healthy, and lower intake of unhealthy, foods). Portuguese adolescents were most accepting of the strategies, followed by Polish adolescents, while Dutch and UK adolescents reported the lowest acceptability. These findings partially align with previous findings from studies investigating acceptability of interventions among adult populations. For example, previous studies have also found that women tend to be more accepting of interventions [Novel findings are that younger adolescents, overweight and obese adolescents, Portuguese and Polish adolescents, and immigrant adolescents are more accepting of intervention strategies. Younger adolescents&#8217; higher acceptance as compared to older adolescents may be due to the fact that the need for autonomy and personal agency increase during adolescence [The strategies were found to be separable into two meaningful categories, based on the type of strategy: the first category reflected policies aimed at promoting healthy eating, while the second reflected policies aimed at discouraging unhealthy eating. The dimension of &#8220;type of strategy&#8221; was thus more influential for acceptability than the other dimensions (level of intrusiveness, setting and change agent). This is very clear, for example, with regard to the two items reflecting price manipulations, which only differ in type of strategy and share the same level of intrusiveness, the same setting and the same change agent. Crucially, the item reflecting an increase in the price of unhealthy foods (i.e., a strategy discouraging unhealthy eating) was rated as the second-lowest acceptable strategy, while the item reflecting a decrease in the price of healthy foods (i.e., a strategy promoting healthy eating) was rated as the second-highest acceptable strategy.While type of strategy was thus clearly the most important dimension in terms of acceptability, the results suggest that the other dimensions also affected acceptability ratings, at least for strategies discouraging unhealthy eating. Regarding the level of intrusiveness, strategies discouraging unhealthy eating with lower levels of intrusiveness (according to the Nuffield intervention ladder [In a similar vein, strategies discouraging unhealthy eating in a broader out-of-home setting and strategies delivered by policy makers as change agents were rated as less acceptable than strategies in a home or school setting and strategies delivered by parents or teachers. Again, for strategies aimed at promoting healthy eating, setting and change agent do not appear to have a systematic influence on acceptability, with scores varying across the different types of settings and change agents. It is important to note that the dimensions of setting and change agent are not completely separate dimensions but are intertwined to a certain extent (parents are more likely to be change agent for strategies in a home setting, for example). However, the distinction between the two is not redundant. For example, the strategy of prohibiting soft drinks and unhealthy schools refers to a school setting, but is delivered not by teachers but by policy makers.The current study is not without limitations. An important limitation is that we assessed acceptability of only ten intervention strategies, which were determined by the authors. Many more strategies exist [Another limitation lies in the fact that we have currently only assessed associations of a limited number of individual characteristics (socio-demographics, BMI and average healthy and unhealthy food intake) with acceptability. While these characteristics have been found to be associated with policy support in earlier studies among adults [</chapter><chapter title="Conclusions">Adult support for intervention strategies aimed at improving youngsters&#8217; eating behavior is typically high. However, less research has investigated the views of adolescents themselves with regard to such strategies. The present study aimed to contribute to filling this gap in the literature. The results demonstrated that adolescents are, overall, moderately accepting of such strategies. Importantly, level of acceptability was moderated by type of intervention strategy: adolescents reported higher acceptability for strategies aimed at increasing healthy eating behavior than for strategies aimed at decreasing unhealthy eating behavior. Furthermore, adolescents showed a preference for non-intrusive strategies over more intrusive ones, particularly with regard to strategies aimed at decreasing unhealthy eating. As it has been shown that intervention strategies are more likely to actually instigate behavior change when they are considered acceptable by the people they are targeted at [</chapter><chapter title="Availability of data and materials">Not applicable.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700579"><title>Improved transcription and translation with L-leucine stimulation of mTORC1 in Roberts syndrome</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>BMC Genomics</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Baoshan</first-name><last-name>Xu</last-name></author><author><first-name>Madelaine</first-name><last-name>Gogol</last-name></author><author><first-name>Karin</first-name><last-name>Gaudenz</last-name></author><author><first-name>Jennifer L.</first-name><last-name>Gerton</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Research Article</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Background">Cohesinopathies are a group of developmental disorders, including Roberts syndrome (RBS) and Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), caused by loss of function mutations in the cohesin complex or its regulators. The cohesin complex is a structural component of chromosomes and helps to facilitate many different chromosomal processes such as genome organization, chromosome segregation, double-strand break repair, and gene expression. The developmental defects associated with the cohesinopathies include slow growth and small size, hirsutism, mental retardation, craniofacial anomalies, limb malformations, and heart, gastrointestinal, and auditory problems. While the molecular etiology of these developmental disorders is unclear, one working model is that the loss of cohesin function results in changes in gene expression during embryogenesis [RBS is an autosomal recessive, multi-system developmental syndrome caused by loss of function mutation in a gene that encodes a cohesin acetyltransferase, We recently reported that mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling was strongly downregulated in human RBS patient cells, accompanied by p53 activation [In addition to its role in promoting nucleolar function, cohesin plays a role throughout the genome in forming chromatin loops that can affect gene expression. For instance, cohesin promotes the formation of loops at the imprinted loci The rescue provided by L-Leu in animal and tissue culture models for the cohesinopathies strongly suggested that many of the critical transcriptional changes were ameliorated by boosting translation. To address L-Leu dependent transcription and translation at a gene-by-gene level, we examined translation initiation complexes and performed ribosome profiling in RBS cells. We found that L-Leu partially rescued translation initiation, translational efficiency of ribosomal subunits and translation factors, and mitochondrial function in RBS cells. However, other differentially expressed genes do not respond to L-Leu, suggesting they are misexpressed independent of the TOR pathway. These include the imprinted genes and </chapter><chapter title="Results">Our previous studies demonstrated ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis were defective in RBS cells. For our analysis, we used normal human fibroblasts, RBS fibroblasts (homozygous mutation 877_878 delAG in exon 4 of We decided to examine expression of individual ribosomal proteins in the WT, RBS mutant, and corrected cell lines.

Since L-Leu improved 4EBP1 phosphorylation in RBS cells (Fig.&#160;To further evaluate translation initiation complexes, we immunoprecipitated eIF4E and examined interacting proteins (Fig.&#160;To systematically determine the translational efficiency of each mRNA in RBS fibroblasts, we used ribosome profiling and RNA deep sequencing. Wild-type, mutant, and corrected fibroblasts were treated with D-Leu (bioinactive form) or L-Leu. Ribosome profiling monitors translational efficiency by measuring ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (ribosome footprints) relative to the number of mRNAs [Two recent studies have examined translational efficiency in the presence of mTOR chemical inhibitors [Hsieh et al. reported a second group of genes with a pyrimidine-rich translational element (PRTE) that were hyperdependent on mTOR-controlled translation [Previous analysis by another group using a bioinformatics approach known as Babel analysis identified genes with significantly reduced translation associated with impeded mTOR activity [These results demonstrate that the gene groups that show exceptionally poor translation in response to pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 also show poor translational activity in RBS cells. Furthermore, the translation of these same gene groups was partly improved by L-Leu treatment. For these gene groups, the effects of 3 and 24&#160;h treatments were similar, suggesting that these gene groups contain many direct targets of the mTORC1 pathway. Taken together, these results are consistent with the conclusion that L-Leu activates mTORC1 function in RBS fibroblasts.In addition to using predefined gene lists, we identified all genes whose translational efficiency was increased with L-Leu treatment in RBS cells. We used different methods to identify genes with improved translation efficiency: 1) Babel analysis, 2) fold change in translational efficiency greater than two and a minimum of 20 reads. For both methods, the gene ontology (GO) term analysis was very similar and included enrichment for ribosome components, translation initiation and elongation factors, protein targeting/sorting genes (co-translational process, and post-translational translocation), and RNA metabolism genes (Tables S2, S3, S4). We found that L-Leu improved the translational efficiency of more genes at the long timepoint (561 genes at 24&#160;h We used MEME to discover new motifs associated with genes with 2 fold or greater improved translational efficiency at 3&#160;h [Loss of mTORC2 function has been shown to inhibit translation of many cell cycle proteins, including cohesin and condensin subunits such as SMC3, STAG1, NIPBL, SMC2 and SMC4 [It has been reported that mTORC1 inhibition reduces mitochondrial biogenesis and activity via a 4EBP1 dependent mechanism [We also examined the translational efficiency of the same 868 genes. We found that the translational efficiency of 32 genes showed improvement at 3&#160;h and 96 genes at 24&#160;h with L-Leu (Additional file To further study whether the improved transcription and translation of mitochondrial genes with L-Leu manifested in improved mitochondrial function, we measured cellular ATP levels (Fig.&#160;snoRNAs guide chemical modification of ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs, small nuclear RNAs, and mRNAs [Many snoRNA genes are hosted by ribosomal protein genes.

In fact, several imprinted genes were differentially expressed in RBS cells (Fig.&#160;Homeobox (There are over 6000 differentially expressed genes in RBS cells, but ~1000 fewer with L-Leu treatment, suggesting a significant fraction of the differential expression could be translation-driven.

Ribosome profiling combined with RNA seq allowed us to evaluate the contribution of differential expression and translation in RBS. We speculate that L-Leu provides partial rescue of translation and translation-dependent gene expression without rescuing cohesin dependent chromatin organization. Our data, combined with the existing literature, argues that at least two different mechanisms generate differential gene expression in RBS cells: 1) defects in looping or other aspects of chromosome architecture and 2) loss of translation function. This second mechanism can be targeted by L-Leu stimulation of mTORC1 signaling. Our work suggests the possibility that a few critical loci that contribute to translation, such as imprinted genes and rDNA, play a key role in the RBS disorder. L-Leu treatment allows us to begin to distinguish between differential gene expression that is dependent on mTORC1 signaling versus independent in the Additional human diseases with defects in translation include the ribosomopathies, diseases caused by defects in ribosome biogenesis [How L-Leu stimulates mTORC1 has been the topic of debate.

The invited experts represented different disciplines related to the topic including oncologists, hematologists, gynecologists, fertility specialists.A total of ten controversial issues were focused on at the conference. Experts were asked to present an up-to-date review of the literature on these topics. In addition, the presentation of own unpublished data when available was encouraged.On the basis of the data presented, as well as the expertise of the invited speakers, recommendations surrounding each topic were discussed and prepared with the aim to help physicians in counseling their young cancer patients interested in fertility preservation. To gain a United States (US) perspective, the recommendations were discussed and reviewed by Dr. Ann H. Partridge, from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston (MA).To evaluate the levels of evidence and grades of recommendation, the grading system commonly used in oncology was chosen (Table&#160;Elevated blood level of endogenous estrogen are known to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer [For these reasons, some concerns exist on the safety of using ovarian stimulating drugs. However, unlike HRT, characterized by a long lasting exposure to low estrogen levels and more robust data on the subsequent risk of breast cancer with this approach [Recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies evaluated the association between hormonal infertility treatments and risk of developing breast cancer [Recently, a large US cohort study reported reassuring results about the long-term effects of ovarian stimulating drugs with clomiphene or gonadotropins [Despite these encouraging findings for infertile women who wish to undergo IVF procedures, caution is needed because it is difficult to assess the risk of breast cancer in this setting. In fact, several factors (e.g. pregnancy, infertility itself and the use of different therapeutic protocols) might impact study results due to their direct or indirect effect on the risk of developing breast cancer [Ovarian stimulating drugs with standard treatment protocols may be administered in subfertile/infertile women without increasing the risk of developing breast cancer (III, B). The long-term use of clomiphene outside the current limited indications (i.e. first-line therapy of WHO Group II anovulatory infertility) should be discouraged because of a possible increase in breast cancer risk (III, B).A considerable proportion of cancer patients of childbearing age (approximately 50&#160;%) desire pregnancy at the time of cancer diagnosis [Breast cancer patients have the lowest pregnancy rate among cancer survivors, with an overall 67&#160;% reduction in the chance of having babies after cancer treatment as compared to the general population [In addition, the possible occurrence of congenital abnormalities and the potential obstetric and birth complications are two main concerns for young cancer survivors who want to reproduce after anticancer treatment. In general, reseach has revealed that the neonatal outcomes in both male and female survivors are not different from those of the general population [To date, pregnancy after cancer should be considered safe and not be discouraged in general [Pregnancy in cancer survivors, after adequate treatment and follow up, should not be discouraged, including among patients with endocrine-sensitive breast cancer (III, A).Anticancer treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy) may affect male and female fertility transiently or permanently [As recommended by major international guidelines on fertility preservation in cancer patients, clinicians should discuss with their patients the potential impact of anticancer treatment on fertility as early as possible and help with fertility preservation decisions among at-risk survivors interested in having children after cancer [However, the rate of treatment-related infertility is variable and depends on several factors: type of cancer, age of the patient, history of previous treatment for infertility and comorbidities, type and dose of the chemotherapy regimen used, method of administration (oral versus intravenous), size and location of the radiation field and its dose, need of adjuvant endocrine therapy (Table&#160;Onco-fertility counseling should be individualized, discussing both the absolute benefits of the proposed anticancer treatment (e.g. adjuvant chemotherapy or long duration of endocrine therapy in young breast cancer patients at low risk of recurrence) and the risk of infertility for each individual (based on patient-related factors [age, comorbidities, ovarian reserve in women [All patients with potential interest in keeping their fertility should be referred to fertility unit for adequate determination of risk of infertility, chances of future conception and how to proactively preserve it (V, A). However, some cancer patients will not require the help of a fertility clinic after cancer treatment (V, B). Since several patient- and treatment-related factors are associated with the risk of developing infertility, the oncofertility counseling should be tailored to the individual patient (V, A).Despite a growing amount of evidence suggesting that fertility issues are of great importance for young cancer patients, how many are counseled and offered these procedures is not well documented. In men, sperm cryopreservation is an effective strategy for fertility preservation: it does not require major delays in treatment initiation and can be easily performed in many centers [The percentage of women who choose to undergo the available fertility preservation options after fertility counseling varies from 2&#160;% to over 50&#160;% [In a recent prospective study conducted in 7 large Italian Institutions, the rate of application of cryopreservation techniques was evaluated in male and female cancer patients who underwent onco-fertility counseling over a period of 2&#160;years (unpublished observations). Out of 510 men, 507 (99.4&#160;%) cryopreserved at least one semen sample, and 88 (17.4&#160;%) patients underwent two or more sperm collections. Out of 491 women, 132 (26.8&#160;%) were considered not eligible for cryopreservation strategies (i.e. due to need to start chemotherapy immediately, inadequate ovarian reserve, high risk of complication or use of treatments with a low risk of gonadotoxicity). Among eligible patients, 66.6&#160;% underwent cryopreservation techniques to preserve fertility (Table&#160;Greater effort is needed to improve both the communication between patients and physicians about fertility risks and preservation options, and the collaboration among oncologists and fertility specialists to give patients the opportunity to undergo well-timed and complete reproductive counseling. Further research is needed to better understand the preferences of patients among the available strategies for fertility preservation: this information would have great importance from a public health perspective and for resource allocation standpoint. Moreover, a better understanding of the factors that influence patients&#8217; choice would help physicians to improve the quality of their fertility counseling.In men, sperm cryopreservation is an easily accessible and widely available option in more than 95&#160;% of patients and should be encouraged for those who want to preserve fertility (III, A). On the contrary, from 2&#160;% to 65&#160;% of women undergo one of the available cryopreservation options: oncologists should discuss with them the fertility issues and secure proper counseling in appropriate centers prior to cancer treatment (IV, A).Anticancer treatments (i.e. chemotherapy and radiotherapy) can damage the germinal epithelium in men resulting in oligozoospermia or azoospermia: in fact, a large proportion of patients treated for cancer have lower sperm concentrations than matched controls [Sperm cryopreservation before gonadotoxic therapies is the standard strategy for fertility preservation in adult men [The limited available data on fatherhood after cancer are related to offspring from spontaneous conceptions or from IVF/ICSI with spermatozoa cryopreserved before the initiation of anticancer treatments. Until recently, none of the research reported an increased rate of congenital abnormalities or malignancies in children born from treated patients with subsequent spontaneous conceptions [Conflicting results were demonstrated in a cohort study from Danish and Swedish registries, regarding 8,670 babies with a paternal history of cancer: a total of 8,162 children were conceived naturally and 508 were conceived using ART (i.e. IVF or ICSI) [The efficacy of ART in patients treated for cancer seems to be good. In a comparative study of male cancer survivors treated with ICSI using cryopreserved sperm, which were compared to non-cancer infertile males that had previously frozen sperm, the live birth rate using ART was similar in the two groups [To our knowledge, only two studies have been published describing the offspring of patients undergoing ART conceptions with the use of fresh ejaculated or testicular semen after treatment [In a recent large population-based study on the outcomes of progeny born after ART in the general population, there was no increase in the overall risk of cancer among British children born after assisted conception during the 17-year study period [Paucity of data is available on fatherhood after cancer. Although most of the published data are reassuring, some recent conflicting results suggest a potential increased risk of birth defects particularly among the children born closer to a paternal cancer diagnosis, and caution should be taken in counseling these patients (V, B for discussion with patients); data on children conceived after ART are too scarce to draw any conclusion although in the general population, available evidence for the outcomes of progeny after ART suggests safety of the techniques themselves (V, B for discussion with patients).Different protocols with different preparations and dosages, are available in standard ART for oocyte or embryo cryopreservation [For many diseases, delays of 2&#160;weeks prior to anti-neoplastic therapy are not possible (e.g. acute leukemia). However, even in the setting of adjuvant therapy, concerns arise regarding timing of therapy. In early stage breast cancer, evidence suggests that the earlier adjuvant chemotherapy is administered, in general, the better patients&#8217; outcome is obtained [The risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), a severe complication of COS, should be taken into account, particularly in young patients with high ovarian reserve. In these cases, triggering ovulation with LHRHa instead of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) has been proven to significantly reduce the occurrence of OHSS, a complication that may also further delay the start of anticancer treatments [The short-term exposure to high estrogen levels due to the COS is an important safety concern in patients with breast cancer. For this reason alternative protocols for ovarian stimulation with the use of tamoxifen [To avoid the need for COS, cryopreservation of immature oocyte or of oocytes matured in vitro are under clinical development [To date, only one study has reported the safety of performing ART following anticancer treatments for breast cancer treatment [The current limited data suggest the safety of a COS in cancer patients (III, B). &#8220;Random-start protocols&#8221; can be employed to avoid delays in anticancer treatment initiation (III, B). LHRHa ovulation triggering should be adopted in patients at moderate-high risk for OHSS (I, A). Letrozole (or tamoxifen) should be incorporated in the protocol for COS in cancer patients with hormone-responsive tumors (III, B).Embryo cryopreservation and oocyte cryopreservation are standard strategies for fertility preservation in female cancer patients [Two different methods for embryo or oocyte cryopreservation are currently available: slow freezing and vitrification [In Italy, due to the legal restrictions limiting the use of embryo cryopreservation, an increasing trend toward the use of oocyte freezing has been shown since 2004. Using data from the Italian Registry of ART in the period 2007&#8211;2011, Levi Setti and colleagues showed an increasing use of vitrification in infertile couples and by 2010 vitrification became the most applied technique [Most of the available data on pregnancies obtained with thawing of embryos or oocytes derive from the infertile non-oncologic population. Pregnancy rate after embryo thawing is strongly dependent on age, ranging from over 40&#160;% in women younger than 35&#160;years to less than 20&#160;% in women over 40&#160;years [Cancer patients might have a weaker response to COS [As a matter of fact, many issues should be considered when analyzing ovarian response to COS in cancer patients, such as the particular protocols used (i.e. &#8220;random-start protocols&#8221; to avoid the delay in treatment initiation, or the use of tamoxifen or letrozole in patients with hormone sensitive diseases to reduce the risk of the exposure to the high estradiol levels during COS) and/or the presence of a possible underlying reduced ovarian reserve (e.g. patients with BRCA 1&#8211;2 mutations or due to concurrent illness) [To increase the oocyte yield for fertility preservation, it has been proposed to perform two consecutive ovarian stimulation cycles [Very limited data are available on pregnancy rates with thawed oocytes or embryos in cancer patients. To date, a total of 8 deliveries have been reported after oocyte warming in the oncologic population [Embryo and oocyte cryopreservation are standard options for fertility preservation (III, B). Vitrification showed a better performance than slow freezing (II, B). During oncofertility counseling, patients should be aware that data on the success of these strategies derive from infertile women in general and that a different ovarian response to stimulation might be expected in cancer patients (IV, B).Ovarian tissue cryopreservation has been proven to be an effective, yet still experimental, technique to preserve fertility in patients undergoing gonadotoxic therapies [Although ovarian tissue cryopreservation is still an experimental strategy, it might be proposed to selected patients. In particular, this method is the only available option to preserve fertility in prepubertal girls who are candidates to gonadotoxic therapies [A major advantage of this technique over oocyte or embryo cryopreservation is that only few days are required for its application: tissue retrieval can be performed by laparoscopy, which can be planned shortly after cancer diagnosis, or during a laparotomy if needed for oncologic therapies. This technique can be performed at any time of the menstrual cycle and does not require hormonal stimulation. For these reasons, cryopreservation of ovarian tissue can be proposed to selected patients who cannot delay the initiation of anticancer treatments [Another promising indication of ovarian cortex cryopreservation is the situation in which patients have already received chemotherapy. Mature or immature egg collection is not recommended in patients who have received recent chemotherapy, owing to possible decreased or no response to ovarian stimulation, genetically abnormal oocytes, and deleterious effects on reproductive outcome (i.e. high abortion and malformation rates), as suggested by animal studies [The success of ovarian tissue cryopreservation is strongly dependent upon the patient&#8217;s ovarian reserve. For this reason, patients over 40&#160;years or with reduced ovarian reserve are not good candidates [The best candidates for ovarian tissue cryopreservation are prepubertal girls (III, A). The technique may also be proposed to patients scheduled for treatments with a high risk of premature ovarian insufficiency who cannot delay anticancer treatments or who have already received chemotherapy, or with contraindications to COS (III, B). Patients with cancer with a high risk of malignant contamination to the ovaries (e.g. aggressive hematologic malignancies) should not be considered eligible for ovarian tissue auto-transplantation (V, B).Embryo and oocyte cryostorage is commonly applied in several fertility units as part of infertility treatments, whereas ovarian cortex cryopreservation is applied only as a technique for fertility preservation in patients at risk of gonadic exhaustion. Moreover, the effective assessment of a program of ovarian tissue cryopreservation requires time: in fact, many years may pass before a sample is thawed and transplanted. Due to the relatively low number of procedures requested and the difficulty in evaluating survival of primordial follicles, the technique of ovarian cortex cryopreservation should be concentrated to few centers with the appropriate expertise [Animal experiments showed that the conservation of ovarian tissue at 4&#160;&#176;C for up to 18&#160;hours causes no morphological damage to preantral follicles; on the contrary, the storage of ovarian tissue at 20&#160;&#176;C for 18&#160;hours significantly reduces the percentage of morphologically normal follicles [Centers that perform cryopreservation, storage and transplantations of ovarian tissue require a connection with highly specialized laboratories for detecting traces of malignant cells in the sample at both pathologic and molecular levels before the grafting. Optimization of freezing methods and cancer cell detection techniques are other two valid reasons to concentrate the application of an &#8220;experimental technique&#8221; in a few referral centers. On the other hand it would be preferable to organize the harvesting of the tissue locally to ensure the access to this technique to all the eligible patients. Even though some skills are required to perform an ovarian cortex biopsy suitable for cryopreservation, any gynecological or fertility unit may easily acquire them.In order to optimize the procedure in terms of both patient management and cost-effectiveness, the harvesting of the tissue can be performed locally but subsequent sample freezing and storage centralized (III, B). A well-organized network between fertility units is required (III, B).Ovarian suppression with the use of LHRHa during chemotherapy is an attractive option to preserve gonadal function and fertility given the wide availability of such agents and the advantage of causing no delay in the initiation of anticancer therapies [However, despite this research effort, ovarian suppression with LHRHa during chemotherapy is still considered an experimental strategy to preserve fertility by some international guidelines due to both the uncertainty regarding the efficacy of this strategy and the absence of data on pregnancies and long-term ovarian function [Recently, two large randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of ovarian suppression with LHRHa during chemotherapy in breast cancer patients have reported long-term outcome results [Recently, the 2015&#160;St. Gallen International Expert Consensus panel and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines have been updated to acknowledge the use of LHRHa in preventing chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure of hormone receptor negative breast cancer patients [Ovarian suppression with LHRHa during chemotherapy can be used in combination with other preservation techniques including cryopreservation strategies, thus increasing the chance of both fertility and gonadal function preservation after anti-cancer systemic therapies.Ovarian suppression with the use of LHRHa during chemotherapy should be considered a reliable strategy to preserve ovarian function and fertility, at least in breast cancer patients, given the availability of new data suggesting both the safety and the efficacy of the procedure have become available (I, A)*.(*CYA, HAA, GBLS and WHW disagree with this statement, considering the strategy still experimental).</chapter><chapter title="Conclusions">Over the last several years, thanks to improvements in the prognoses of cancer patients, increasing attention has been given to survivors&#8217; fertility issues. International guidelines on this topic have been recently updated and published [Although there is a great interest in this field, due to the lack of large prospective cohort studies and randomized studies on these topics, the level of evidence is not higher than 3 for most of the recommendations highlighting the need of further research efforts. Several registries and prospective studies are ongoing to evaluate feasibility, safety and efficacy of fertility preserving strategies in cancer patients and encouraging patient participation in these studies is crucial to acquire more robust conclusions.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700582"><title>Age related decline in female lar gibbon great call performance suggests that call features correlate with physical condition</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>BMC Evolutionary Biology</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Thomas A.</first-name><last-name>Terleph</last-name></author><author><first-name>S.</first-name><last-name>Malaivijitnond</last-name></author><author><first-name>U.

Thus receivers may additionally interpret loud, high pitched calls as a fitness signal associated with larynx strength, which may correspond with overall body strength [Temporal aspects of loud calls can also be associated with caller condition or state. Examples include young adults producing longer calls than more senior individuals [Gibbons (family Hylobatidae) are small Asian apes that produce loud, complex vocalizations in song bouts, and females produce the great call, often in the context of well-coordinated duets with a mate [The great calls of all gibbon species have a conspicuous climax near the end, characterized by notes produced at the highest speed and/or pitch, and a peak in amplitude [Although age has not been verified experimentally to correlate with RHP in white-handed gibbons, in order to provide support for the hypothesis that the lar gibbon&#8217;s great call climax is an honest index of caller condition, we used age as the most appropriate and available proxy for RHP, given that physical strength generally declines with age, including a reduction in respiratory function [To further test the hypothesis that our measures of the great call climax are potential indices of RHP, we analyzed how vocal parameters change within individual singing bouts, predicting that (vi) as a bout of great calls progresses, the maximum F0, delta F0, and climax duty cycle will decrease, and the number of Finally, we also report, for the first time in this species, the peak intensity of great call climaxes, using measurements from captive animals. By quantifying the high intensity of great call climaxes, we lend support to the hypothesis that production of great call climaxes pushes females to their physical limits.</chapter><chapter title="Methods">We made recordings from a large group of adult female lar gibbons, spanning a wide age range (9&#8211;45.2&#160;years). 15 of the subjects were wild animals, recorded at the Mo Singto&#8212;Klong E-Tau long-term research site at Khao Yai National Park, Thailand (101&#176;22&#8217;E, 14&#176;26&#8217;N), 130&#160;km NE of Bangkok in June-July 2013 and July-August 2014, under a research permit issued by the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT) and the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP) of Thailand. All wild lar gibbons have been habituated to the presence of researchers for decades, in some cases for their entire lifetime. We also obtained recordings from two captive female lar gibbons at the LEO Zoological Conservation Center in Greenwich, Connecticut, USA. Each captive animal was housed with an adult male in one of two large outdoor enclosures. We made all recordings with a digital solid-state recorder (Marantz PMD661, Kanagawa, Japan) and a Sennheiser microphone: K6 power module and ME67 recording head and windscreen (Sennheiser Electronic, Wedemark, Germany). All recordings were 24 bit, with a 48&#160;kHz sample rate.All research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee of Sacred Heart University, and adhered to the American Society of Primatologists Principles for the Ethical Treatment of Non-Human Primates. We avoided direct interaction with animals in all cases, but to minimize recording distances we usually approached wild gibbons close enough to record from directly underneath the tree in which an individual was vocalizing (&lt;50&#160;m), and in direct line of sight. We recorded all calls between 6:00 and 11:00&#160;AM, as the females engaged in morning duets with males, often in response to the calls of nearby animals. We identified individual wild animals by territory location and individual pelage color and markings based on long-term photo-records and long-term knowledge of individuals [We determined the ages of the two captive animals from birth records. The wild gibbon population has been studied for decades and all females included in our analyses have been monitored continuously since they were first recorded in the study population [Our method of calculating female age based on first parturition potentially underestimates the age of these 4 animals, if individuals had a birth prior to their natal dispersal and/or before their emigration into the study population. However, secondary female dispersal has not yet been observed in the Khao Yai white-handed gibbon population and our approach to calculate female ages was conservative as it resulted in minimum ages. Moreover, a margin of error of only a few years is unlikely to be consequential, particularly for the purpose of grouping animals into the broad categories of young and old, given the long lifespan of the species and the broad range of ages sampled. The maximum lifespan of captive Hylobates has been reported to be 35.6&#160;years [We converted all recordings of great call climaxes into spectrograms (Window type: Hann, FFT size: 512 hz, frame overlap: 50&#160;%), using Raven Pro 1.5 Sound Analysis Software (Cornell Lab of Ornithology Bioacoustics Research Program, Ithaca, New York), and made measurements from the spectrograms. The amplitude and frequency of the lar gibbon&#8217;s great call climax rises and falls over multiple notes [In addition, we combined the measures described above to create an index of call quality for each animal, to obtain a single measure that could be compared across all ages. We created the index by ranking animals, from 1 to 17 (Two age groups were compared, using separate between-subject t-tests (two tails), to test the hypothesis that broadly differing age classes are distinguishable, even if more precise ages cannot always be predicted based on call characteristics. Too few subjects were available to divide the sample further. Thus, all animals below the median age of 17.6&#160;years were categorized as young adults (In order to determine how often great calls can be accurately assigned to either the young adult or old adult age groups, we also used the call parameters in a nested, permuted discriminant function analysis (pDFA) [In order to test the hypothesis that The results of our comparison of song parameters by age allowed us to predict that these parameters would change over the course of song bouts, within individuals. We were able to record bouts containing&#8201;&#8805;&#8201;8 great calls from seven females, all from the wild population (mean: 9.9 calls per bout; range: 8&#8211;12, mean bout length 32.8&#160;min, range 12&#8211;54&#160;min). Two animals produced two bouts each; for each of these animals, we averaged the note parameters from each of their bouts and used those averages to represent that animal in subsequent comparisons. We calculated the mean delta F0, maximum F0, climax duty cycle and number of We recorded the peak intensity (dB SPL, A scale, 125&#160;ms &#8216;fast&#8217; time weighting) of great call climaxes from the two captive animals (ages 9.0 and 25.9&#160;years) in their outdoor enclosures, each housed with an adult male. We obtained dB measures with an SPL meter (Checkmate CM-150, Galaxy Audio, Wichita, KS) with a built in &#189; inch electret condenser microphone and a windscreen (frequency range 31.5Hz-8KHz, measuring level range 30-130&#160;dB, accuracy &#177;1.5&#160;dB), and only collected data when the animals were oriented towards the microphone. Animals were separated from the microphone by wire mesh, all calls were produced and recorded from heights of over 2&#160;m, and no major sound reflective structures were in the vicinity of the recording site, so the data are essentially free-field. As subjects were free to move within their enclosures, we had to measure from a range of distances, between 2.7 and 6.1&#160;m. In order to control for amplitude differences due to the effect of spherical spreading, the dB of all calls obtained from distances greater than the nearest (2.7&#160;m) call were adjusted to that distance standard by applying the inverse distance law. In order to calculate the mean dB of all peak call notes for a given individual, each dB measure was converted to intensity, these intensity measures were then averaged, and that average was then converted back into an average dB measure. Peak call amplitudes were compared between the two animals with a two-tailed between-subjects </chapter><chapter title="Results">The differences in call parameters between the two age groups, which we describe in this section, are summarized in Fig.&#160;The maximum F0 effects described above may be due to a general lowering of voice in older females, rather than solely due to a failure to reach higher pitch in the peak notes. Lowering of voice has been identified in other female primates, as a correlate of increased body size [Great call climaxes from young adult females had a higher duty cycle (mean 0.76&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.01, range 0.73 &#8211; 0.81) than those of old females (mean 0.71&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.01, range 0.66 &#8211; 0.79) (T (15)&#8201;=&#8201;2.98, In contrast to the F0 and duty cycle measures, where young females were expected to show higher performance, old females were predicted to produce more The overall call quality index, a summary of the call features described above, differed between the young (mean 11.6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.63, range 8.5 &#8211; 13.75) and old females (mean 6.6&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.03, range 2 &#8211; 11): T (15)&#8201;=&#8201;4.25, Within individuals, climax notes that were followed by Because Maximum F0 decreased over the course of song bouts (We also measured the intensity of great call climaxes.

The great call is arguably the most significant vocalization in the female gibbon&#8217;s vocal repertoire, in part due to its long-range propagation. If the differences in the call parameters that we measured correlate with physical condition, then young females may be capable of signaling high RHP to potential rivals. These hypotheses have not yet been fully tested, but our interpretation is compatible with field observations of female-female replacement, because among the females of known ages that have been observed to date, only young females have replaced old females, and not Within-bout changes to the climax of the territorial great call and measures of the high intensity of climaxes support the hypothesis that these vocalizations are produced at the limit of callers&#8217; vocal abilities, and thus may indicate a caller&#8217;s condition or stamina. We do not yet know if this is the case, and further testing of this hypothesis would be technically challenging. Appropriate tests would require experiments that directly measure individual physical condition and relate it to our great call measures, in addition to field data showing that great calls predict, for example, territory size, quality, length of tenure on a territory, or lifetime reproductive success. Nevertheless, additional characteristics of the great call climax, and the contexts in which it occurs, are in line with the hypothesis. Climaxes have been described as &#8220;penetrating and unmusical&#8221; [The great call differences by age that we have documented could reflect differences in caller motivation rather than physical ability, what game theoretical models describe as &#8216;aggressiveness signaling&#8217; [If the great call climax contains cues that make it an honest index of a caller&#8217;s physical condition, this does not guarantee that other animals attend to such cues, or that they are even capable of detecting the differences that we describe. It is theoretically possible that evolutionary constraints have acted to enforce honest call climaxes, but in the absence of selection specifically for honesty [Psychophysical data on primate auditory perception suggest that the maximum F0 and delta F0 differences that we quantified here (the smallest being the change in maximum F0 frequency within bouts, at approximately 4&#160;%) are large enough to be detectable by conspecific listeners. In general, auditory thresholds are similar across many primates [Our measurements of peak call intensity were all obtained from the highest pitched expirations of the call climax, demonstrating that intensity and frequency are correlated in the great call, and likely interdependent. Similarly, a positive correlation between amplitude and F0 occurs in loud vocalizations from multiple taxa [Although many studies that analyze the temporal features of calls have measured note duration [Our within-bout results revealed a decrease in maximum F0, similar to the negative age-effect. But unlike the effect of age, no change in duty cycle was observed over the course of bouts. Overall, the within-bout changes that we observed support the notion that the production of great call climaxes with a high F0 cannot be sustained over prolonged bouts. Unfortunately, our within-bout sample contained too few callers to allow for age comparisons across extended bouts.It is not known what specific proximate mechanisms are responsible for the age-related changes to vocal output that we report. Reproductive hormonal condition is one likely candidate. Although there is an association between androgen level and call qualities in male lar gibbons [Changes to the female voice, especially those mediated by sex steroid hormones, may influence mate choice by males. Barbary macaque males, for example, respond more strongly to female calls that signal an increased probability of conception [</chapter><chapter title="Conclusion">Here we have shown that a vocal signal, the great call climax of female lar gibbons, often exceeds 100&#160;dB SPL at close range and shows declines in frequency with age and within bouts, as well as age-related declines in temporal characteristics. If the measures that we used are predictive of an animal&#8217;s RHP, which is not yet known, then these findings suggest that the great call might serve as an index of caller condition in the context of female-female competition in territorial defense, and potentially also for attracting a mate(s). Further studies are needed to explore these possibilities.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700583"><title>Elaborating on theory with middle managers&#8217; experience implementing healthcare innovations in practice</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Implementation Science : IS</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Sarah A.</first-name><last-name>Birken</last-name></author><author><first-name>Lisa D.</first-name><last-name>DiMartino</last-name></author><author><first-name>Meredith A.</first-name><last-name>Kirk</last-name></author><author><first-name>Shoou-Yih D.</first-name><last-name>Lee</last-name></author><author><first-name>Mark</first-name><last-name>McClelland</last-name></author><author><first-name>Nancy M.</first-name><last-name>Albert</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Short Report</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Background">Middle managers&#8212;employees who are supervised by an organization&#8217;s top managers and who supervise frontline employees [The theory of middle managers&#8217; role in implementing innovations in healthcare organizations (&#8220;the middle manager role theory&#8221;) hypothesized that middle managers promote innovation implementation by fulfilling four roles: diffusing information, synthesizing information, mediating between strategy and day-to-day activities, and selling innovation implementation [Although the theory has received some empirical support [</chapter><chapter title="Method">The study capitalized on a live conference of 154 nurse managers who participated in the Cleveland Clinic&#8217;s 2014 Nursing Innovation Summit. The Summit defined, described, and promoted clinical practice innovations (e.g., role redesign on a hospital nursing unit) and described strategies for navigating innovation implementation. During the Summit, SB distributed a self-administered questionnaire that contained closed and open-ended questions. Closed-ended items assessed the extent to which participants&#8217; experience aligned with hypothesized roles and activities (Table&#160;We used descriptive statistics to summarize perceptions of the importance and relative importance (ranking) of the four hypothesized roles.Open-ended (qualitative text entry) items allowed participants to elaborate on activities they engaged in to fulfill their roles. Specifically, we asked participants to provide:We employed template analysis, combining content analysis with grounded theory, to analyze participants&#8217; examples of activities engaged in to promote innovation implementation. Content analysis involved using a priori definitions of activities hypothesized in the middle manager role theory; grounded theory allowed activities not hypothesized in the theory to emerge from the analysis [The questionnaire was distributed to all 154 Summit participants; of these, 63 were eligible to complete the questionnaire because they identified as ever having been a middle manager and had overseen innovation implementation in a healthcare organization.

Our ability to draw conclusions is limited by our convenience sample and space restrictions for qualitative data entry on the questionnaire; however, study participants shared compelling experiences that are likely to be somewhat consistent with our population of interest: middle managers who oversee innovation implementation in healthcare organizations.The middle manager role theory generally aligned well with the practical experience of study participants. Of note, participants reported that, in practice, selling innovation implementation is the least important of the four roles. This finding helps to distinguish middle managers from champions. Champions are often top managers or physicians who attempt to persuade employees to engage in innovation implementation (e.g., [Quantitative and qualitative results differed with respect to participants&#8217; perceptions of the importance of synthesizing information and selling innovation implementation. A third of participants ranked synthesizing information as their most important role, but participants offered the fewest examples of synthesizing information. The opposite is true with selling innovation implementation. It is possible that participants interpreted synthesizing information as a means of selling innovation implementation (e.g., interpreting facts about innovation implementation to convey relevance). On the other hand, middle managers may view selling innovation implementation as champions&#8217; role and, therefore, less central to their own. Despite this, middle managers may engage in selling innovation implementation because they feel better equipped to do so than engaging in roles that they deem more important, such as synthesizing information. Future research should assess whether this is the case; if so, implementation efforts may benefit from training middle managers to engage in the roles that they deem important but are ill-equipped to perform and to delegate roles that they view as less central (e.g., asking champions to sell innovation implementation).Activities participants engaged in that they perceived to be unrelated to the four hypothesized roles expand definitions in the middle manager role theory.

Eighty percent of Cambodians live in rural areas, 45&#160;% are under the age of 20 and approximately 28&#160;% live below the poverty line. Despite recent improvements in health indicators, maternal mortality remains high at 206 deaths/100,000 live births [The abortion rate in Cambodia has been estimated to be 50/1,000 women, compared to the global average of 28/1,000 [Mobile phone-based interventions (&#8216;mHealth&#8217;) refer to the use of mobile technologies for health [Although a number of mHealth contraception initiatives have been launched and scaled up in low-income settings, to date, the effect of mHealth interventions on post-abortion family planning (PAFP) have not been reliably established. There is therefore a need for more evidence on the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for PAFP.Formative research is often used to design context-specific interventions. It may involve literature reviews and research with the target population and other key stakeholders [</chapter><chapter title="Methods">The MOTIF study was conducted at four Marie Stopes International Cambodia (MSIC) clinics providing comprehensive sexual and reproductive healthcare services; two serving predominantly urban populations around Phnom Penh City, and two serving predominantly rural populations (Battambang and Siem Reap). Ethical approval was granted by the LSHTM ethics committee, the MSI ethics committee and the Cambodia Human Research.Development of the MOTIF intervention was iterative and included processes recommended for the development of complex interventions [Research conducted in Cambodia included a case note review of clinic data, interviews and focus group discussions (FGD), consultation with clinicians and local organisations implementing mHealth activities, development of a conceptual framework, and testing the intervention with the target group.Case note review of 100 MSIC abortion clients was conducted during October and November 2012 using routinely collected data to estimate baseline event rates. We identified the first 25 clients seeking abortion services at each of the four clinics attending sequentially from 1st September 2011 from the clinic register. Repeat attendances over subsequent 12-months were identified. Where available, data was collected on age of client, residence, provision of a mobile phone number, contraceptive history, reason for abortion, subsequent follow-up attendances, contraceptive use and abortions. Data were summarised using simple statistics. Additional file Following the case note review we conducted interviews and FGDs with clients seeking abortion services. Clients attending for abortion services were recruited sequentially, and asked if they would like to participate at the end of their post-abortion counselling session. Clients were provided with an information sheet to read, or it was read to them, and provided signed or thumb-printed consent. Clients were either interviewed at the time of attending for abortion services or when attending for follow-up appointment, according to their preference.Author UV conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with clients during December 2013 and January 2014 across the four study clinics in the Khmer (Cambodian) language. A topic guide was developed containing questions to explore clients&#8217; reasons for seeking abortion services, contraception and mobile phone use and to seek views on the proposed intervention (see Additional file Four FGDs were conducted during January and February 2014; two at urban clinics, and two at rural clinics. The aim of the FGDs was to test proposed messages. The FGD topic guide was informed by the interviews. FGDs were conducted by authors CS and UV and a summary of the discussion transcribed to English. Transcripts were read by CS to identify key themes. These findings were used to guide intervention development. We also consulted with other organisations implementing mobile phone-based interventions in Cambodia.We developed a preliminary intervention based on these activities. The messages were then tested with eleven interview and FGD participants who agreed to receive messages on their mobile phones. Messages were modified based on feedback received on content, tone, speed of voice, and sound quality.</chapter><chapter title="Results">We reviewed literature on determinants of contraceptive use in order to identify areas amenable to an intervention. We found Sheeran&#8217;s framework to be useful as it combines developmental models (describing contraceptive use resulting from transition through a series of stages) and decision-making models (psychological factors that speed up or delay this transition). Sheeran&#8217;s framework considers contraceptive use as a product of We identified qualitative research supporting these findings. Experience of negative side-effects may be related to traditional health beliefs in Cambodia [Dingle identified factors related to knowledge, access, cost and autonomy as important reasons for non-use of contraception in Cambodia. Women often obtain information about contraception from friends and relatives, with myths and rumours commonplace [Lopez highlighted the need for increased attention to theory of behaviour change in designing and evaluating interventions for contraception use [We reviewed evidence from systematic reviews of mHealth interventions. Free, et al.,&#8217;s systematic review of mHealth interventions found that there is currently no evidence of benefit for simple text-message medication reminders (RR 1.00, 0.77&#8211;1.30) [Multi-faceted mHealth interventions have been shown to increase smoking cessation in a high-income setting and adherence to HIV medication in a low-income setting [We found limited published literature on mHealth in Cambodia although Cambodians are enthusiastic mobile phone users, as can be witnessed during daily life in both urban and rural areas. Although mobile phone ownership is estimated to be over 90&#160;%, most Cambodians use simple rather than internet-enabled smartphones [Bullen identified a number of operational challenges facing mHealth programmes in Cambodia [We next reviewed literature on behaviour change interventions to increase contraception use. Systematic reviews have found limited evidence for interventions to improve contraception and PAFP [Other successful mHealth contraception initiatives in low-income settings include Mobile for Reproductive Health (m4RH) and Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action (MAMA). m4RH used best practices from health communication programs to systemically develop family planning text messages and MAMA developed adaptable messages based on WHO and UNICEF guidelines [The case note review found uptake of effective PAFP either immediately after abortion or at two-week follow-up to be 40&#160;% (
          Interview and FDG participants reported seeking abortion services for mainly economic, or less commonly, health reasons. Most women disclosed the abortion to their husband or partner. Many women reported side-effects when using contraception in the past. Clients reported it was difficult to make PAFP choices at the time of abortion. Reasons for this included wanting to wait for their health to improve first, having to wait for their salary or needing to discuss with their husband. Some women reported they were unable to retain sufficient information about contraception. When we contacted clients for the one-month post-interview phone call they often had many questions relating to contraception and side-effects.Regarding the proposed mHealth intervention, most clients said they preferred to make phone calls over text-message. Most could not read and many had never used text-messaging. However, most reported listening to voice messages received on their phones. All clients were positive about the proposed new MOTIF intervention. Despite sharing of phones, privacy was not mentioned as a particular concern. Most clients stated that messages sent to their phones should mention the terms &#8216;Marie Stopes&#8217; and &#8216;contraception&#8217; so they would know the topic of the message and who it was from. Consultation with clinic staff and organisations implementing mHealth activities in Cambodia also suggested a limited likelihood of success with a text-message intervention.We developed a conceptual framework (Fig.&#160;We tested the messages with clients and made final modifications based on their feedback. See Table&#160;</chapter><chapter title="Discussion and conclusions">We used a wide range of methods to inform the development of the MOTIF intervention. Our literature review indicated that our intervention should address intrapersonal factors, in particular health concerns. We found limited evidence on behaviour change interventions to increase the use of specific contraceptives. Whilst this may be partly due to a limited number of high quality, adequately powered trials, the focus of the interventions needs to be examined. Interventions often focus on adherence to a specific method, which may be less effective than an intervention that anticipates method-specific discontinuation and facilitates safe method switching [A key finding from the case note review was high unmet need for PAFP. It was not known if clients used other providers to obtain contraception as most women did not return to MSIC clinics. Most clients provided a mobile phone number, which led us to believe that a mHealth intervention could be an opportunity to maintain contact with clients. Interviews and FGDs supported these findings. Health concerns related to contraception were widely reported. Clients also stated a clear preference for a voice-based intervention. In developing the conceptual framework and intervention we hypothesised that a multi-faceted mHealth intervention would remind clients about contraceptive methods, identify problems with side-effects early, provide support, and boost motivation to use PAFP, while reducing discontinuation and method switching.The strength of this paper is that we have clearly described how each component of the formative research contributed to the final intervention design. Interventions are often developed without evidence of having gone through a formative research process or without clearly describing that process. Furthermore, existing behaviour or theoretically predicted mechanisms of action are not fully described [Using a similar approach to Lester, et al., we developed a semi-automated intervention, which sought to identify clients most in-need of counsellor delivered support [The MOTIF intervention was associated with an increase in self-reported contraception use four months post-abortion but not at 12&#160;months. The intervention was associated with increased long-acting contraception use at four and 12&#160;months [Ethical approval was granted by the LSHTM ethics committee, the MSI ethics committee and the Cambodia Human Research Ethics Committee for both the formative research (Phase 1) and the trial (Phase 2).

Furthermore, integration of the sugar-rich material to 2G fermentation results in a higher ethanol concentration in the broth without the need to increase the solid content, which would also increase inhibition. A higher ethanol concentration can decrease the cost of downstream processing, such as distillation, in the 2G plant, while at the same time supplying the 1G plant with heat and electricity produced from the residual solid material from the 2G plant. Integration can be achieved either by designing a completely new combined plant, or by installing a 2G unit at an existing 1G plant.The production of wheat, one of the largest starch-grain products in Europe, with a production of 230 million tons in 2013 [Techno-economic evaluations have recently been performed for integrated 1G and 2G (1G&#160;+&#160;2G) ethanol production from sugar cane and lignocellulosic residues, such as bagasse and trash [In the techno-economic evaluations of integrated 1G&#160;+&#160;2G ethanol production that have been performed, mainly sugar cane and bagasse were the substrates considered. These processes differ from that with grain and straw in the composition of the raw material and the co-products. One of the main co-products of ethanol production from sugar cane and bagasse is electricity, while in the case of grain and straw, DDGS can be produced as a co-product from the considerable amount of protein in the grain. Thus the co-products are attractive in two completely different markets.The present study was performed to evaluate the feasibility of ethanol production in an integrated 1G&#160;+&#160;2G plant using grains and wheat straw as the raw materials. Experimental trials were first carried out in a process development unit with 30-L reactors to verify the fermentation results obtained previously on lab scale using a mixture of wheat and barley grain meal (WBG) and wheat straw by Erdei et al.

The cases consisted of a 1G stand-alone plant (1G) followed by six integrated 1G&#160;+&#160;2G plants. In the three first cases (1G, E1, and B1) only glucose fermentation was considered. In E1, concentration by evaporation of the thin stillage, generated in the solid&#8211;liquid separation step after distillation, was modeled. The concentrated solution was then re-mixed with the solids generated in the solid&#8211;liquid separation step after the distillation. This mixture was subsequently transferred to the dryer. In B1, the thin stillage was transferred to anaerobic digestion instead of being concentrated. In case C5E1 and C5B1, glucose and xylose fermentation was modeled for the E1 and B1 configurations. The last two cases UB1 and UC5B1 were based on B1 and C5B1, respectively; however, the biogas was in these cases upgraded to vehicle fuel quality. A more detailed description of the cases is presented in the section &#8220;Table&#160;Only the excess electricity that can be sold was regarded as a product when calculating the energy efficiency.

The choice depends mainly on the market for DDGS and biogas at the location of the plant. Since the prices of both DDGS and biogas have been fluctuating a great deal in recent years, a detailed market analysis must be performed before making any decisions. However, in the current study, a large amount of DDGS and combined C5&amp;C6 fermentation were found to be more promising than biogas production if the biogas was not upgraded to vehicle fuel quality. Furthermore, if legislation prevents the production of DDGS that includes genetically modified yeast, a separation step could be included in the 1G process before C5&amp;C6 fermentation to separate the solids from the liquid fraction. The solids can then be utilized for DDGS production without being mixed with the yeast. A decrease in the biogas yield from 80 to 60&#160;% also largely affects the NPV. Therefore, it is important to perform more detailed experiments on biogas production from 1G&#160;+&#160;2G substrates.</chapter><chapter title="Methods">The integrated plant was modeled assuming a 1G raw material loading of 360,000&#160;tons dry grain per year and a 2G raw material loading of 180,000&#160;tons dry wheat straw per year.

The WBG had a dry matter (DM) content of 89&#160;%, which contained 76&#160;% starch. The 2G material (wheat straw) used in the experiments was obtained from Johan H&#229;kansson Lantbruksprodukter (Lunnarp, southern Sweden). The straw was first cut with a knife mill and then sieved to obtain particles of 2&#8211;10&#160;mm. The straw consisted of approximately 91&#160;% DM. The NREL method for determining structural carbohydrates and lignin content in biomass [The components of the dry raw materials are given in Table&#160;The experimental procedure consisted of steam pretreatment of dilute-HAn aqueous solution of 0.2 wt% HTriplicate samples were used to determine the DM and WIS contents of the SPWS. Standardized analytical NREL procedures [The pretreatment step was modeled with an RStoic reactor in Aspen Plus. The reactor was assumed to be operated as a continuous reactor into which 20-bar steam was injected at 190&#160;&#176;C. To account for heat losses and the void of the reactor, the steam consumption was increased by 10&#160;% compared to an adiabatic unit. The outgoing material was assumed to be cooled by two-step flashing, at 4 and 1&#160;bar. The main part of the flashed steam, which contains volatile compounds formed during pretreatment, was condensed and cooled before being fed to an anaerobic digestion unit and then a waste-water treatment unit. Part of the steam was recirculated and used to preheat the incoming wheat straw.The composition of the SPWS and the recovery factors for carbohydrate and lignin used in Aspen Plus are given in Table&#160;Two-step enzymatic hydrolysis (liquefaction and saccharification) was used to produce the WBG starch hydrolysate used in fermentation.

The WBG was mixed with water to achieve a DM of 35&#160;% and then liquefied by thermostable &#945;-amylases (Termamyl SC; Novozymes A/S, Bagsv&#230;rd, Denmark) at 85&#160;&#176;C, pH 5.5 for 3&#160;h, using an enzyme dosage of 0.5&#160;g enzyme/kg DM WBG. After 3&#160;h of liquefaction, the temperature was reduced to 60&#160;&#176;C, the pH was adjusted to 4.2, and amyloglucosidase (Spirizyme Fuel; Novozymes A/S) was added at a dosage of 1&#160;mL/kg DM in order to saccharify the liquefied WBG for 24&#160;h. To obtain a homogeneous material, all the batches were combined into one large batch. The WIS content and the carbohydrate concentrations in the hydrolyzed WBG were determined before fermentation.EH was performed on duplicate samples of the solid fraction of the pressed SPWS in a 30-L fermentor vessel (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland), using a total working weight of 15&#160;kg. The pressed SPWS was diluted to a WIS concentration of 10&#160;% before hydrolysis was performed with a Cellic CTec3 cellulase enzyme preparation (Novozymes A/S Bagsv&#230;rd, Denmark) at an enzyme loading of 10 filter paper units (FPU)/g WIS. Hydrolysis was carried out for 96&#160;h, at 45&#160;&#176;C, pH 5.0, and at a stirrer speed of 500&#160;rpm. The pH was adjusted to 2 after EH to precipitate colloidal low molecular weight lignin and improve the separation of the solid and liquid fractions. The hydrolysate was then centrifuged at 4000&#160;rpm for 10&#160;min in several batches, which were mixed into one homogeneous batch. The pH of the hydrolysate was adjusted to five by the addition of NaOH, before fermentation. The washed solid fraction was analyzed to determine the carbohydrate, lignin, and ash contents.Fermentation was carried out in duplicate batches using the 30-L fermentor vessels described above with a total working weight of 21.5&#160;kg. The hydrolysate from the EH of the SPWS was autoclaved in 5-L bottles at 120&#160;&#176;C for 20&#160;min before being added to the fermenters. A nutrient solution, consisting of a sterilized solution of 10.0&#160;g (NHAs earlier lab-scale experiments had shown good conversion of both C5 and C6 to ethanol, C6 fermentation as well as co-fermentation of C5&amp;C6 was modeled. The solid&#8211;liquid separation step that was carried out in the experiments after pretreatment was omitted in the simulated C5&amp;C6 co-fermentation cases. In the Aspen Plus model, it was assumed that both C6- and combined C5&amp;C6-fermenting yeast were cultivated on glucose from starch in a separate tank. The yeast production yield was assumed to be 0.5&#160;g dry biomass/g glucose, and the pitch rate 3&#160;g/L. It was assumed that commercially available enzymes were purchased for the hydrolysis of WBG and SPWS. EH and fermentation were modeled with RStoic reactors in Aspen Plus. The residence times were set to 24&#160;h for the EH of SPWS, 28&#160;h for the liquefaction and saccharification of WBG and 96&#160;h for fermentation in the integrated cases. The cleaning and refilling times were set to 8&#160;h, in the liquefaction and saccharification stage of WBG and to 12&#160;h in the hydrolysis of the SPWS and the fermentation stages.The overall process conversion factor of glucose to ethanol from the raw materials was set to 0.80 based on the experimental results after withdrawing the sugar needed for yeast cultivation, since yeast cultivation was not included in the experiments. In the combined C5&amp;C6 fermentation, the xylose to ethanol conversion factor was set to 0.9 in the fermentation step, and a xylan to xylose conversion factor of 0.95 was used in EH, which was higher than that achieved in the experiment, but should be the aim in a future industrial plant. It was assumed in the simulations that 50&#160;wt% of the xylan in the WBG was converted to xylose, due to hemicellulolytic activity in the amyloglucosidase preparation [The overall ethanol yield (It was assumed that a 25-stage, low-pressure stripper column followed by a 35-stage, high-pressure rectifying column, were used in the distillation process to concentrate the fermentation broth to 92.5 wt%. The ethanol stream was then dehydrated with molecular sieves to 99.5 wt%. A top-stage pressure of 0.3&#160;bar and a Murphree efficiency of 50&#160;% were assumed in the stripper column, and 1.3&#160;bar and a 75&#160;% Murphree efficiency in the rectifying column. The pressure was kept low in the stripper column to avoid gluten fouling, which can occur at higher temperatures. The rectifier was equipped with a partial-vapor condenser, where the heat from condensation was used to heat the stripper column. The overhead vapor from the rectifier was superheated and then concentrated to about 99.5&#160;% in molecular sieve dehydration columns before cooling and storage. The reject stream from the molecular sieves was mixed with the condensed overhead vapor from the stripper column before being fed to the rectifier. The ethanol concentration in the rectifier feed was approximately 55&#160;wt%, and the mass reflux ratio about 2.1.Thick stillage from the stripper columns, with a DM content of between 10 and 15&#160;wt% (depending on the case), was filtered to attain a wet cake, consisting of solid particles with 45&#160;wt% DM, and a thin stillage. The thin stillage contained between 6 and 11&#160;wt% soluble DM. The filter unit was assumed to have a retention of solid particles of 95&#160;% [Evaporation was modeled as a five-effect, forward-feed system. The boiling point elevation was accounted for using the expression derived by Larsson et al. [A steam dryer was used to dry the incoming wet cake or the mixture of the wet cake and syrup to produce DDGS. The incoming material was dried with 4&#160;bar superheated steam at 200&#160;&#176;C. Most of the outgoing steam from the dryer (90&#160;%) was superheated and recirculated back to the dryer, and the remaining 10&#160;% was condensed and fed to the anaerobic digestion stage. The outgoing solids from the dryer were assumed to have a DM content of 88&#160;wt%.The liquid fraction after pretreatment, the rectifier and the thin stillage, together with the condensed steam from the dryer, pretreatment and evaporation stages, were anaerobically digested for the production of biogas. Because experimental data regarding the exact substrate mixture are limited, some assumptions had to be made for the anaerobic digestion step, which could lead to some uncertainty in the model. However, Nkemka and Murto [The residence time in the fermentation step was set to 55&#160;h, and the ethanol concentration in the broth after fermentation was set to 11&#160;wt%. The cleaning cycle time in the fermentation step was the same as in the integrated cases. The raw material loading was increased to 55&#160;ton&#160;DM/h to achieve the same ethanol production as in the integrated C6-fermenting cases. The CHP plant (described in Section &#8220;</chapter><chapter title="Energy supply">The heat and electricity required in the process were supplied by a co-located CHP. Superheated steam at 90&#160;bar and 470&#160;&#176;C was produced by a boiler fueled by the solid residues, mainly lignin, generated in the solid separation step after the EH of SPWS, together with biogas and sludge produced in the anaerobic digestion step. If the process did not generate sufficient material for combustion, surplus energy in the form of natural gas (methane) was included in the simulations. The 1G case was run entirely on natural gas. Surplus energy could also be obtained by burning straw or other residual material instead of natural gas, since both systems exist. A steam turbine system was connected to the boiler to generate electricity. High-temperature steam required in the pretreatment and the drying steps was withdrawn at 20&#160;bar, and medium-temperature steam was withdrawn at 4&#160;bar to supply the rest of the process with heat. The isentropic and the mechanical efficiencies for the turbines were set to 90 and 97&#160;%, respectively. The electricity demand of the plants was calculated from evaluations made using APEA and estimates specified in the manufacturers&#8217; quotations. The electricity requirement of the process was then subtracted from the total amount produced in the plant, and any surplus was sold to the grid.The energy content was calculated using the LHV of the materials, obtained from the values of heat of combustion calculated in Aspen Plus. The LHV for the incoming materials WBG and straw were 15 and 19&#160;MJ/kg DM, 11&#160;MJ/kg DM for the enzymes, and 27, 50, and 16&#160;MJ/kg DM for the outgoing products, ethanol, methane, and DDGS, respectively. The energy required for harvesting and transporting the raw materials an average distance of 50&#160;km to the plant was set to 0.03&#160;MJ/MJ dry biomass [The energy efficiency of the outgoing products was calculated as the energy flow (in MW) in the products divided by the energy flow into the process [shown in Eq.&#160;(</chapter><chapter title="Case description">Seven cases were simulated to obtain the NPV and energy demand of different process alternatives. The first case was a stand-alone 1G plant, and the six following cases were modeled as integrated 1G&#160;+&#160;2G plants. The cases are listed in Table&#160;The first case (1G), a stand-alone 1G plant, was modeled to produce the same amount of ethanol as the integrated C6-fermenting cases. Cases E1 and B1 were modeled using the experimental results obtained with a C6-fermenting yeast. In E1, the thin stillage generated after the separation step of the stillage from the distillation was concentrated by evaporation. The syrup generated was subsequently added to the solid fraction and dried to produce DDGS. In B1, the thin stillage was sent directly to the anaerobic digestion step to produce biogas, and only the solid fraction from the stillage was used for DDGS production. In cases C5E1 and C5B1, co-fermentation of C5&amp;C6 sugars was assumed, and the cases were modeled as for E1 and B1, respectively, from the separation step after distillation and downstream. The biogas yield was 80&#160;% of the theoretical (0.25&#160;methane/COD) in all the seven cases. In the C5E1 and C5B1, it was assumed that the DDGS could be sold as animal feed. However, this will depend on the yeast used and/or future regulations regarding genetically modified substances in animal feed. In the UB1 and UC5B1 cases, the surplus biogas was upgraded to vehicle fuel quality and thereby also the price of the biogas was increased. An overview of the different process alternatives can be seen in Fig.&#160;</chapter><chapter title="Cost calculations">Vendors&#8217; quotations and APEA were used to calculate the capital cost of a plant located in Sweden. The energy and mass balances obtained from Aspen Plus were used to size the equipment. The costs for the following equipments were estimated based on vendors&#8217; quotations; boiler, dryer and pelletizing equipment, molecular sieves, filter presses, anaerobic digestion, and pretreatment units. The chemical engineering plant cost index was used to update the prices to 2012 values. The price index for the calculations was based on 2012, and the construction time of the plant was 1&#160;year. An exchange rate of 1 EUR&#160;=&#160;9 SEK was used. The capital cost item included the cost of equipment and installation, civil construction, electricity installation, instrumentation, land, engineering, and fees associated with the investment cost. The operational cost item was based on Swedish conditions and separated into variable and fixed costs. Fixed costs included maintenance, insurance, working capital, and labor. The cost of working capital was determined according to recommendations in the literature [Equation&#160;(A MESP was calculated for the different cases by setting the NPV to zero. The MESP and the NPV were then used to evaluate the cases. The results of the calculations should primarily be used to compare the different cases with each other, and should not be taken as absolute values. A more detailed investigation is required for financial decisions.</chapter><chapter title="Sensitivity analysis">Sensitivity analyses were performed for variations in the cost of raw materials, the prices of products, the biogas yield, and the discount rate, in order to investigate their effect on the NPV. The biogas yield was decreased by changing the COD removal from 80&#160;% of the theoretical value (0.25&#160;kg&#160;methane/kg COD at 100&#160;%), to 60&#160;% (0.15&#160;kg methane/kg&#160;COD). The cases with 60&#160;% biogas yield were indexed with &#8220;2&#8221;. The cost of raw materials and the selling prices of products were varied from 0 to 300&#160;% for each case, compared with the costs and prices used in the base case scenario. In addition, the effects of varying the cost of yeast per L ethanol produced were investigated. The costs and prices were varied separately, so synergy effects were not considered.

The advent of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) led to a paradigm shift of care and markedly improved outcomes in patients with HIV. Nevertheless, the global prevalence of HIV remains staggeringly high, and was estimated at 35.3 million in 2012 [</chapter><chapter title="Case 1">A 33&#160;year old man presented with tender lateral neck swelling, cramping abdominal pain, and night sweats. He reported intra-nasal cocaine use and an instance of unprotected heterosexual contact in the preceding month. He denied intravenous drug use. On admission, he was afebrile with normal vital signs. His physical examination was significant for bulky adenopathy with submental, submandibular, cervical, inguinal, and axillary involvement. He also exhibited abdominal distention with hepatosplenomegaly.The initial laboratory examination was remarkable for a white blood cell count of 18,760 with 54&#160;% lymphocytes, platelet count of 123,000, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 51 U/L, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 65 U/L. Haptoglobin was undetectable and lactate dehydrogenase was 743 U/L. HIV testing was performed singly and reactive by the Abbott Architect HIV antigen/antibody 4th generation screening assay (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA). Confirmatory testing using the Multispot HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Redmond, WA, USA), however, was nonreactive and an HIV viral load was undetectable. He had Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia with 4580 copies/mL detected. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of his neck demonstrated numerous bilateral non-necrotic lymph nodes within the jugular chain, the largest of which measured 1.6&#160;cm. CT of his abdomen and pelvis revealed extensive bulky adenopathy throughout both the peritoneal and retroperitoneal spaces. An excisional biopsy was also performed on a submental lymph node which demonstrated florid follicular hyperplasia with interfollicular immunoblastic proliferation, hilar plasmacytosis, and an atypical T cell population, with some features of an angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. He had concurrent laboratory abnormalities that included positive rheumatoid factor, direct antiglobulin test, and hepatitis B IgM. Hepatitis B viral load was undetectable. A CD4 count was 1042 cells/&#181;L but represented only 10&#160;% of T lymphocytes. Peripheral flow cytometry was performed with findings consistent with multiple T-cell phenotypic abnormalities, which were thought to represent a lymphoproliferative process versus polyclonal reactive process due to immune dysfunction.After a multi-disciplinary review, the pathology of the biopsied lymph node was felt to represent reactive changes with atypical lymphocytes secondary to EBV infection without clear evidence of a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder. He was seen on several occasions in follow-up, and ultimately returned to his previous state of health. CT imaging revealed spontaneous resolution of lymphadenopathy. EBV viral load became undetectable and platelet counts normalized. While the patient&#8217;s age and previous multiple sexual partners made acute EBV infection less likely upon initial presentation, no alternative diagnosis was found.</chapter><chapter title="Case 2">A 52&#160;year old woman presented with 3 weeks of jaundice and increasing abdominal distension. The initial laboratory examination was remarkable for a white blood cell count of 24,000 with an absolute lymphocyte count of 0, hemoglobin of 5.6&#160;g/dL, platelet count of 83,000, and an international normalized ratio of 2.7 in the absence of anticoagulant medications. Her metabolic panel revealed a sodium of 124&#160;mmol/L, total bilirubin of 4.2&#160;mg/dL, and a mild increase in AST at 72 U/L.A paracentesis was performed by the admitting physician. In the course of this procedure, the physician sustained a cut from a scalpel visibly soiled with patient blood. Per facility protocol, testing for blood-borne pathogens was performed on the patient. Hepatitis B and C serologies were nonreactive. HIV testing was performed singly using the Abbott Architect p24 antigen/antibody assay which resulted in positive. Confirmatory testing by Multispot antibody differentiation was positive for HIV-1 antibodies and negative for HIV-2 antibodies. On further interview, the patient denied a prior history of HIV testing. She denied previous blood transfusions, intravenous drug use, or tattoos. She endorsed two lifetime male sexual partners with inconsistent condom use.Her initial blood sample arrived to the laboratory with two different patient labels, so HIV testing was repeated on the same day with a different venipuncture using the Abbott Architect p24 antigen/antibody assay and the same results returned. Additional testing revealed an absolute CD4 count of 116 cells/&#181;L corresponding to 61&#160;% of her T lymphocytes and a CD4/CD8 ratio of 2.18. Potentially confounding conditions were evaluated yielding a negative urine human chorionic gonadotropin, negative anti-nuclear antibody, and negative toxoplasma IgG and IgM. An HIV viral load showed no detectable RNA and a qualitative proviral DNA test was also negative. A Western blot was sent and returned as indeterminate due to nonspecific background reactivity.Antiretroviral therapy was not initiated. CT of her abdomen showed innumerable peripherally enhancing and centrally necrotic hepatic lesions consistent with malignancy as well as enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes and spinal lesions consistent with metastases. A CEA and CA 19-9 were grossly elevated. The patient developed hemodynamically significant hematochezia requiring resuscitation with multiple units of blood products. She subsequently became hypoxic and hypotensive and required intubation with pressor support. After discussion with her family, support was withdrawn, the patient died, and the family declined autopsy.The physician who was exposed to blood was started on post-exposure prophylaxis with emtricitabine-tenofovir and raltegravir. His baseline Abbott Architect p24 HIV antigen/antibody test (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) performed singly on the same day as the aforementioned patient was reactive. As with the patient, the confirmatory Multispot antibody differentiation test which was drawn from a separate blood sample was also positive for HIV-1 but not HIV-2. An HIV viral load and qualitative proviral DNA test were both negative. He continued post-exposure prophylaxis for 1 week and then discontinued these medications. Follow up testing 6 months after exposure was negative on both HIV antigen/antibody test and proviral DNA.In further review of specimen handling and processing, the patient and physicians blood samples were not shipped to the facility laboratory together as they had distinct origins from the medical intensive care unit and emergency department respectively. Due to concerns for mislabeling of the patients initial blood sample, repeat testing was performed with a separate venipuncture which yielded the same results. Given the congruent laboratory results from separate blood samples, no corrective action reports were filed from the laboratory on that day.</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">We report the cautionary spectrum of false positive HIV diagnostics in three patients (Table&#160;Following HIV transmission, markers of infection can be detected by diagnostic assays in a predictable fashion. An &#8216;eclipse phase&#8217; typically lasting 10&#8211;14 days is characterized by infection in local mucosal and lymphoreticular tissue during which systemic viremia is not detected. Approximately 7 days later, viral RNA becomes present in serum at quantities detectable by nucleic acid amplification. Capsid protein p24 is the next chronological measurable component of acute infection by way of detection of soluble antigen. Approximately 5 days after detection of p24 antigen, seroconversion occurs and anti-HIV antibody becomes evident by reactive results to various available ELISA assays [Various commercial fourth generation tests are available for use, all of which utilize the combined detection of p24 antigen and HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody. Ly et al. performed a large analysis to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of various fourth generation tests. Numerous assays including the Abbott Architect p24 HIV antigen/antibody test (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) were able to detect infection prior to p24 antigen assays and in fewer than 3&#160;days after nucleic acid testing while maintaining a specificity of greater than 99&#160;% [Lee et al. performed a comparative analysis of commercially available 3rd and 4th generation screening assays in effort to evaluate the specificity and false positivity of the newer 4th generation assay [The new Multispot antibody differentiation test has been reported to have sensitivity and specificity greater than 99&#160;% [In 2014, the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) updated recommendations for the diagnosis of HIV infection to include a novel algorithm using the fourth generation screening and confirmatory assays [</chapter><chapter title="Conclusion">Rapid HIV diagnostics such as fourth generation antigen/antibody assays and HIV antibody differentiation assays permit the identification of increased numbers of recent HIV infections and can help facilitate faster entry into care. While these testing modalities have high reported sensitivity and specificity, like all tests, they remain imperfect. CDC guidelines have been issued to assist clinicians in the interpretation of these results, but these cases emphasize that correct use of the algorithm continues to require careful clinical judgment.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700596"><title>A call for biological data mining approaches in epidemiology</title><article-type>editorial</article-type><journal-title>BioData Mining</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Shannon M.</first-name><last-name>Lynch</last-name></author><author><first-name>Jason H.</first-name><last-name>Moore</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Editorial</category></article-categories><chapters /></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700597"><title>Influence of smoking cessation drugs on blood pressure and heart rate in patients with cardiovascular disease or high risk score: real life setting</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>BMC Cardiovascular Disorders</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Andr&#233; Pacheco</first-name><last-name>Silva</last-name></author><author><first-name>Jaqueline</first-name><last-name>Scholz</last-name></author><author><first-name>Tania Ogawa</first-name><last-name>Abe</last-name></author><author><first-name>Gabriela Gouveia</first-name><last-name>Pinheiro</last-name></author><author><first-name>Patricia Viviane</first-name><last-name>Gaya</last-name></author><author><first-name>Alexandre Costa</first-name><last-name>Pereira</last-name></author><author><first-name>Paulo Caleb Junior Lima</first-name><last-name>Santos</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Research Article</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Background">Smoking cessation substantially lowers the risk of death in patients of all ages [These medications demonstrated effectiveness in achieving complete smoking cessation [A recent network meta-analysis of 21 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) showed that bupropion was not harmful for MACEs and appeared to have a cardioprotective effect [There are few studies evaluating combination of therapies for smoking cessation [We examined CV effects of these drugs on blood pressure and heart rate in outpatient setting according to different combination therapies and the previous presence of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and/or acute myocardial infarction.</chapter><chapter title="Methods">We analyzed 900 outpatient subjects followed at the Smoking Cessation Program of the Heart Institute (InCor), University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

The Ethics Committee for Research Project Evaluation (CAPPesq) of the Hospital das Clinicas &#8211; School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, approved the study. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. They agreed with the informed consent form.During the study period, 1791 patients were enrolled to the service. However, 891 patients were excluded because they did not come in the consecutive visits and their data for BP, HR, and/or CO were not available. However, patients with analyzed data (Thus, 900 patients were included in this analysis. They received smoking cessation medication to be taken for at least 12&#160;weeks. Among the available medications, there were nicotine replacement therapies (NRT &#8212; patch and gum), bupropion, and varenicline. In the first visit (baseline), the patient was not in use of any drug for smoking cessation. One of these drugs was prescribed as monotherapy according to the nicotine dependence level, previous use of smoking cessation drugs, availability of the medication and lack of absolute contraindication related to each drug. Varenicline was prescribed for patients who failed in previous attempts with NRT and/or bupropion, or who smoked one or more packs of cigarettes per day.The gap between follow-up visits was 2 to 3&#160;weeks. In all visits the patient were questioned about smoking status, compliance and collateral effects of the medication prescribed, and we evaluated the vital signs, CO level, and withdrawal symptoms.In the second visit, the patients who achieved success with monotherapy and had no or mild withdrawal symptoms were kept with the same medication. The patients who did not achieve success and the patients who achieved complete cessation but with moderate or intense withdrawal symptoms had associated therapies [The data were categorized in 3 visits in sequential follow-up, called initial (baseline), second, and third visits.

The mean HR remained similar in the varenicline group and decreased by 2 beats per minute in the placebo group [There are some studies with the use of NRT in population of smokers without cardiovascular diseases or with hypertension alone [This study has some limitations. BP and HR were measured at 3 consecutive visits. Therefore, although it is enough to have a comparison, possible small changes might be seen in a more prolonged follow. Compliance with the treatment and smoking status were measured during the follow-up period by asking patients and by measuring exhaled CO level, which showed a significant reduction in comparison with basal CO level, regardless of pharmacotherapy used.

Through high-throughput sequencing, 105 novel miRNAs on the other arm of known pre-miRNAs were identified (Additional file All unannotated small RNA sequences that matched soybean genome sequences were mapped to known plant miRNAs in miRBase to identify newly conserved miRNA families and new miRNA members. If the small RNAs matched known plant miRNAs with no more than four mismatches, they were classified as candidate conserved miRNAs and new miRNA members [To predict novel miRNAs in soybean, we used MIREAP (Until now, no soybean miRNAs had been annotated as high confidence in miRBase 21.0 (Among the identified miRNAs, 101 differentially expressed miRNAs with greater than two-fold relative changes (The stem-loop qRT-PCR was conducted to validate and measure the expression profiles of the nine selected differentially expressed miRNAs.

The general process is as follows: first, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) purification of the RNA bands corresponding to 18&#8211;30-nt size fractionation was performed to recover small RNAs; second, ligation of the 5p and 3p adapters to the RNA occurred in two steps, each followed by PAGE purification; third, RT-PCR amplification was performed to generate a cDNA colony template library and then purified by PAGE; and fourth, the template was analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit) and qPCR was performed to produce a qualified library for sequencing.After sequencing, raw sequencing reads were processed into clean reads by filtering out adaptor contaminants, oversized insertions, low-quality reads, poly A tags and small tags&#8201;&lt;&#8201;18&#160;nt.

Following normalization, if one of the miRNA gene expressions between the two samples was zero, then it was revised to 0.01, and if the miRNA gene expression of two samples was less than 1, owing to their too low expression levels, then they were not included in the differential expression analysis. The differential expressions of miRNAs were calculated using fold changes and Two degradome libraries were constructed according to the methods by Addo-Quage et al. and German et al. [Data filtering was performed to remove adaptor sequences and/or low-quality reads present in the raw reads, resulting in clean reads. This was followed by the collection of 20&#8211;21-nt sequences of high quality for subsequent analysis. The degradome tags were mapped to the soybean genome using SOAP and then annotated with rRNA, scRNA, snoRNA, snRNA and tRNA from Rfam and GenBank to separate matched tags from unannotated tags. Degraded sequences with over 70&#160;% single bases in the clean reads were identified as poly-N, which were not used to predict subsequent degradation sites. The statistics of cleaved sites and T-plots were processed by CleaveLand 3.0 (The tags mapped to cDNA_sense were used to predict cleavage sites. Categorization of degradome peaks was performed as follows: The height of the degradome peak at each occupied transcript position was placed into one of five possible categories, described below.

Nilotes are inhabited in the South Sudan and are agro-pastoralists who dwell in the savannas region. Nilotes as well as Nuba breed cattle, but animals are kept not so much for the production of meat and milk, but rather as symbols of wealth and social standing (cows are used for paying marriage dowry) [Nilotes are of unusually large stature, and live in the savannas of the Upper Nile region. They comprise Dinka, Nuer, Shilluk, Anyuak, Baria and a number of small ethnic groups. Nilotes speak languages within the Nilo-Saharan family. Farming and hunting are the major nutritional sources in Dinka and Nuer, populations that breed cattle and lead a semi-nomadic life, while Shilluk, Baria and Anyuak are agriculturalists [The Copts (ancient Egyptians) descend from longstanding cultures of city-states and empires along the Nile, the socio-activities of this group being farming and trade. These different socio-cultural aspects of Copts, Nilotes and Nuba, most likely combined with the serendipitous lack of arising of novel The other residential groups of the Nile (Shwaiga, Gaalien, Mahas and Halfawien) are agriculturists. Despite the fact that their economy is mainly agricultural, they exhibit moderate allele frequencies of LP. This is intriguing in the sense that one would expect sedentary populations to be more able to admix and receive genes from their nomadic counterparts, as the area surrounding the Nile is economically attractive. This assumption is supported by the negative values of the fixation indices of these groups, which may indicate the increase of heterozygosity. Arabs, Nubians and Beja of the Sudan, and Ethiopians show high frequencies of the allele T/G-13915, which is the major LP variant among the nomadic Arabs in Arabian Peninsula [Ethiopians genotyped in this study consist of three major groups, Oromo, Amhara and Tigray, they practice farming and animal breeding. Ethiopians display a genetic similarity with Beja of the Sudan; both of them have significant frequencies of lactase persistence haplotypes.Darfurians is a collective term for a number of residential agriculturalist groups living in arid areas in west of the Sudan (Darfur). Most of the groups in the area practice seasonal cultivation of crops during rainy seasons. They do not rely on fresh milk which is likely the reason why they have low proportion of lactase persistence alleles.Fresh milk is commonly used in pastoralist communities, and although agriculturalists of the Sudan, South Sudan and Ethiopia show lower frequencies of lactase persistence compared to pastoralists, the milk products are widely consumed by all socio-economic classes of East African agriculturalists.

This was initially a result of an improvement in testing efficiency focusing on single-gene assays, but has more recently been due to &#8216;panel testing&#8217;, whereby numerous genes are analysed concurrently in a single assay. A natural progression of this approach is to perform whole exome sequencing and analyse a &#8220;virtual&#8221; gene panel, comprising a subset of the sequenced loci. Extremely heterogeneous disorders, overlapping a spectrum of clinical phenotypes, are ideally suited to analysis by these new approaches and have enabled diagnostic laboratories to significantly expand their test portfolios.We have used virtual exome panels for diagnosis of several heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorders, including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD; OMIM: 244400), one of a number of disorders prevalent in our local community [Two ciliopathies with overlapping features and considerable underlying genetic heterogeneity are Joubert (JBTS; OMIM: 213300) and Meckel-Gruber (MKS; OMIM: 249000) syndromes, which are currently associated with 31 and 13 genes respectively, ten of which are documented to cause both conditions. JBTS is characterised by neurodevelopmental abnormalities in conjunction with a pathognomonic neuroradiological finding (the molar tooth sign). The latter results from cerebellar vermis hypoplasia or aplasia, elongated superior cerebellar peduncles and a deep interpeduncular fossa. Patients often present with a lack of balance and coordination and a wide spectrum of associated features occur, including postaxial polydactyly, retinal degeneration, cleft lip, seizures, as well as renal and hepatic disease [Given the overlapping genetic etiologies of these conditions, a pragmatic solution to robust molecular diagnostic investigation is to undertake concurrent mutation analysis of all JBTS/MKS reported genes. Although this strategy is broadly applicable to heterogeneous conditions, individual populations exist in which a more targeted approach is likely to be more cost-effective. One such example is the high prevalence of Here we present our experience of using a standard diagnostic pipeline to perform point mutation and small insertion/deletion variant detection in a series of patients referred with either JBTS or MKS. We undertook whole exome sequencing and analysed a virtual panel of JBTS- and MKS-associated genes. We subsequently used these data to undertake exome-based CNV analysis to identify exon deletion and/or duplication variants that are typically smaller than those that can be resolved using standard array CGH platforms. Positive CNV analysis results were validated using whole genome sequencing (WGS) and split read mapping to identify breakpoint sequences at nucleotide resolution.</chapter><chapter title="Methods">DNA was isolated from blood or fetal tissue of 26 affected individuals using standard salting out or phenol/chloroform extraction protocols. (The developmental age of the individuals ranged from prenatal to 4&#160;years.) All patients were referred to the Yorkshire Regional Genetics Laboratory, Leeds, for diagnostic testing with a clinical diagnosis of either JBTS (9 patients) or MKS (17 patients). The Leeds East Research Ethics Committee granted ethical approval (07/H1306/113) and written informed consent was obtained from the parents or next of kin of all individuals.Diagnostic mutation analysis of JBTS- and MKS-associated genes (Additional file To verify variants identified by FishingCNV, and to validate their intragenic breakpoints, whole genome libraries were generated and sequenced. Approximately 1&#160;&#956;g of DNA was sheared into 200&#8211;300-bp fragments using a Covaris S2, and an Illumina-compatible sequencing library generated using NEBNext&#174; Ultra&#8482; reagents (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The insert size was ~250&#160;bp and the final enrichment PCR comprised six rounds of thermocycling. Each patient library was sequenced on a single lane of a HiSeq 2500 rapid mode flow cell, generating 175-bp sequence reads. Raw data was converted to FASTQ.gz format using CASAVA v.1.8.2. Adaptor sequences were trimmed from the ends of the sequence reads using Cutadapt v.1.1 (PCR amplicons were designed to span SplazerS-identified breakpoints. The primers used to amplify the Sanger sequencing was used to confirm all variants included on clinical reports; manufacturer&#8217;s protocols were followed throughout (Applied Biosystems, Paisley, UK). Primer details and thermocycling conditions are available on request. Sequence chromatograms were analysed using Mutation Surveyor v.3.2 (SoftGenetics LLC, State College, PA, USA).</chapter><chapter title="Results">We have previously implemented a &#8220;targeted exome&#8221; diagnostic test for primary ciliary dyskinesia [Variant interrogation was restricted to the 34 known disease-associated genes. This reduced the average total variant count from 33,766 to 70 per patient (Additional file In patients, the diagnosis of JBTS or MKS could not be confirmed, either (a) because the identified variant(s) was classified as probably benign, or a variant of uncertain significance or (b) because the patient was a carrier of only a single Retrospective inspection of aligned sequence reads within the putative disease-containing loci did not reveal any homozygous non-reference (or heterozygous) variants to support (or oppose) the existence of the deleted sequences. Inspecting the alignment BAM files in the Integrated Genome Viewer did however reveal a halving of relative read depth at both deletion-containing loci. To validate our findings and delineate the intragenic breakpoints, we performed medium-coverage (9&#215;) WGS using a longer, 175-bp sequencing read. To reduce adaptor read-through, the library insert, size was increased from ~200&#160;bp to ~250&#160;bp. Despite this, ~20&#160;% adaptor-trimmed reads were present in the sequenced dataset (Table&#160;Sanger sequencing of breakpoint-spanning PCR products confirmed the identity of both amplicons and that the breakpoints were clean deletions with no inserted nucleotides (Fig.&#160;</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">NGS workflows suitable for detecting single nucleotide and small insertion/deletion variants are now well established throughout the genetic diagnostic community. Many assays initially used long-range PCR as the target enrichment method [Comparative read-depth analysis enabled the identification of two heterozygous deletion variants in While it is conceptually and practically straightforward to identify homozygous deletions, due to the absence of sequence reads at normally well-captured genomic loci, automated identification of heterozygous deletions and duplications is more challenging and the sensitivity of CNV detection remains poorly defined. Limitations probably include reduced sensitivity of detection of CNVs encompassing GC-rich regions. Such regions, which often include a gene&#8217;s first exon, are consistently reported to be poorly captured using hybridisation enrichment technologies [The ability to detect CNVs in hybridisation enrichment experiments is influenced by gene size and structure. A deletion of large genomic extent could be missed if exons are sparsely distributed, reducing the number of available data-points. Similar considerations apply when trying to define the boundaries of a putative CNV. Consequently, for genes within which CNVs account for a significant component of the mutation spectrum, it may prove beneficial to include additional capture probes within surrounding introns. Although our investigations have revealed two cases in whom dosage variants account for the pathogenic disease allele, we have identified too few events to ascribe a precise sensitivity and specificity to this workflow. Future efforts in this area are likely to be hindered, in the short-term, by the paucity of identified pathogenic copy-number alleles. As such, without performing whole genome sequencing of the entire cohort, it will not be possible to completely exclude pathogenic dosage mutations in JBTS or MKS disease associated genes in the reported patients.We confirmed candidate CNVs using medium coverage (9&#215;) WGS, an increasingly cost-effective solution which enabled nucleotide-resolution breakpoint detection to be delivered in a regional diagnostic laboratory. We used an unsupported 175-bp sequencing protocol, but the recent release of 2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;250-bp kits should further improve the power of this approach to CNV validation. The length of read available for alignment is especially important when performing split-read alignments, as the breakpoint will not in general be centred within the read. The sequence context surrounding the breakpoint will also have a direct bearing on its ability to be detected. Both breakpoints reported here were located within elements identified by RepeatMasker. Low complexity sequences are difficult to align to a reference sequence using short read technology. Although we were able to implement customised sequencer run configurations, these will not be available to all diagnostic laboratories. For these centres, the identification of discordant read pairs (for which the read mapping positions are at variance with the expected library insert size) may offer an alternative route to validating CNVs.Defining CNVs at single-nucleotide resolution permits inexpensive PCR-based genotyping assays to be deployed for testing the extended family, as demonstrated above for case 1.</chapter><chapter title="Conclusions">The CNVs identified here have not previously been reported in the literature and therefore expand the JBTS mutation spectrum. With ever-improving mutation detection techniques, it is likely that dosage variants will be more frequently identified and characterised at nucleotide resolution.

In some cases, it is combined with myocardial failure [The histopathologic examination of the samples obtained from dogs with DCM demonstrates changes in the myocardial structure. There are two well-described forms of histopathologic lesions in the ventricular specimens of dogs with DCM: the attenuated wavy fibre type (AWF) and the fatty infiltration-degenerative (FID) type. Those lesions are mostly encountered in specimens from the left ventricle, but can also occur in the myocardium of the right ventricle and interventricular septum [The mechanism of changes occurring in the atrial myocardial structure in DCM is not well defined. It is suspected that the structural protein defects, impaired tissue oxygen supply and other factors may play a role in the development of the disease [Canine chronic mitral valve disease (CMVD) is the most common cardiovascular disease in dogs and the most frequent cause of congestive heart failure in those animals. The disease predominantly occurs in small breed dogs (e.g. Cavalier King Charles spaniels, Yorkshire terriers, dachshunds) and progresses with age [The purpose of the study was a histopathologic comparison of the left atrial wall specimens obtained from dogs with severe left atrial enlargement resulting from clinically diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or chronic mitral valve disease (CMVD). To the authors&#8217; knowledge, there are no detailed studies comparing histopathologic changes occurring in the atria in those diseases.</chapter><chapter title="Methods">Thirty-one dogs aged from 4 to 19&#160;years (23 males and 8 females) with either CMVD or DCM were included in the study. Dogs met the inclusion criteria if they had an enlarged left atrium according to an echocardiographic examination (left atrial (LA)-to-aortic root (Ao) diameter ratio; LA/Ao &gt;1.7 [All animals underwent a clinical examination, echocardiography and electrocardiography, and were treated and re-examined every 6&#160;months, until they died or were euthanized due to heart failure refractory to treatment. Only the LA/Ao ratio from the last examination of each dog served as an inclusion criterion.The ECG was performed in right lateral recumbency using a 6-channel BTL SD08 device (BTL, UK) with I, II, III, aVL, aVR, aVF, and precordial (V1-V6) lead recordings. The echocardiographic examination was performed in standard views using the Aloka SSD 4000 and Aloka Alpha7 machines and included the assessment of the LA/Ao ratio, end-systolic and end-diastolic left ventricular measurements, ejection fractions and FS, blood velocity through the aortic and pulmonic valve, and the function of the atrioventricular valves. The relative left atrial size was estimated based on the LA/Ao. This parameter was determined using standard images acquired from a right short-axis view at the base of the heart. Estimates of left ventricular systolic function were obtained from the index of circumferential myocardial contraction and FS using the formula: FS[%]&#8201;=&#8201;([LVIDd &#8211; LVIDs]/LVIDd) &#215;100, where LVIDd and LVIDs are the internal left ventricular dimensions at end-diastole and end-systole, respectively. Left ventricular dilation was estimated based on the comparison of chamber measurements (internal diameter and wall thickness) to standard breed-specific or body-weight specific values [The results of the echocardiographic examination (left atrial and left ventricular enlargement) were confirmed during the post-mortem examination, where the type of mitral valve lesion was determined. Heart measurements were taken using a manual 150&#160;mm Beerendonk caliper, measured to the nearest 1/20&#160;mm. The measurements were taken in planes compatible with those used during the echocardiographic examination. Specimens from the left atrial wall were collected from each dog for further histopathologic analysis. They were fixed in 7 % buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin blocks, sectioned at 6&#160;&#956;m, stained using the standard haematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) method and Masson-Goldner trichrome (for a better visualisation of connective tissue), and underwent a light microscopy evaluation. Photomicrographs of each studied specimen were subjected to computer-assisted image analysis, using a computer coupled to an optical Olympus BX53 microscope, equipped with a Color View IIIu digital Olympus camera (Olympus, Japan). A morphometric analysis was performed using Cell^A software (Olympus Soft Imaging Solution GmbH, Germany).To accurately describe the histopathological changes in the atria, specimens were evaluated for the presence and severity of fibrosis, fatty infiltration, inflammatory infiltration, intra-myocardial arterial narrowing and degenerative changes in cardiomyocytes. The latter was expressed as the presence of abnormal cell nuclei (swollen nuclei with an altered structure surrounded by a &#8220;halo&#8221;), loss of striation, and other features of degeneration (e.g. swelling of the cardiomyocyte, blurring of the cell structure and alterations in staining).The presence and severity of interstitial fibrosis and fatty infiltration were evaluated after superimposing a 16-field grid over the digital image and counting the number of fields that showed the presence of fatty infiltration or fibrosis (in 200&#215; magnification, after Masson-Goldner trichrome staining), as proposed by Lobo et al. [The severity of perivascular fibrosis was assessed using the following scoring system: 0, no fibrosis; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe fibrosis (in 100&#215; magnification, after Mason-Goldner trichrome staining).Inflammatory infiltrates were evaluated according to the number of inflammatory cells in a field at a 400&#215; magnification (H&amp;E staining).Intra-myocardial arterial narrowing was assessed using the lumen area ratio (LAR; the luminal area of the vessel divided by the total vessel area, not including the adventitia), as proposed by Falk et al. [Cardiomyocyte degenerative changes (abnormal cell nuclei, loss of striation and changes in cardiomyocyte structure) were assessed using the following scoring system: 0, none or involving &lt;25 % of the myofibres; 1, involving 25&#8211;50 % of the myofibres; 2, involving 50&#8211;75 % of the myofibres; 3, involving &gt;75 % of the myofibres (at 400&#215; magnification, after H&amp;E staining).Each of the features was evaluated in 20 randomly chosen fields per slide (for fatty infiltrates, interstitial fibrosis, inflammatory infiltrates, and cardiomyocyte degenerative changes) or in at least 10 vessels per slide (for perivascular fibrosis and LAR), and a mean score was subsequently calculated for the slide.According to the Polish law [A statistical analysis was performed using StatisticaPL&#174; software (StatSoft, Poland). The Shapiro-Wilk analysis was used to test the data normality.

Seven specimens from the left ventricle presented with an AWF type of lesion, while nine specimens had features of a FID type of lesion. The CMVD group comprised 15 dogs (10 mixed-breed dogs, 2 dachshunds, 1 Cairn terrier, 1 miniature pinscher, and 1 German pinscher, aged 8&#8211;19 years, including 11 males and 4 females) diagnosed with mitral valve disease combined with an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium (Table&#160;Dogs in the DCM group were significantly younger and heavier than those from the CMVD group, but there was no difference in the LA/Ao ratio between both groups (Table&#160;The results of the histopathological analysis are shown in Table&#160;</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">There have been numerous histopathological characterisations of canine DCM [According to Schaper et al. [When comparing ventricular specimens from dogs showing DCM and CMVD, Falk et al. [Studies on dogs with CMVD showed that animals developing congestive heart failure present with lower values of LAR as compared to controls, although this parameter is highly variable in each dog [DCM in dogs is often connected with the occurrence of supraventricular and ventricular rhythm disturbances. Sustained arrhythmias in CMVD occur less frequently [Recent studies [Frustaci et al. [One of the limitations of our study was a lack of dogs with DCM without rhythm disturbances, which could be compared to dogs included in the study. Dogs with DCM often develop rhythm disturbances before the development of clinical symptoms. Further studies including dogs with DCM without arrhythmias may improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of this disease.Another limitation was an observed difference between body weight, age and breed distribution in both groups. This was a result of the different clinical courses of both diseases. DCM mostly occurs in young large-breed dogs, while CMVD mostly occurs in old small-breed dogs. To minimize those differences, we used an increased LA/Ao ratio as an inclusion criterion. There was no difference in the LA/Ao ratio between both groups. Therefore, we assumed that the comparison of atrial remodelling in both groups was justifiable.The variety in the DCM group was a further limitation of the study. We included dogs with idiopathic DCM that developed arrhythmias in the course of the disease and dogs presenting with AF in the first examination. The latter dogs may have had tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. However, all the dogs in the DCM group did not respond well to treatment in late stages of the disease. They developed severe heart failure with left atrial enlargement, and presented with severe tachyarrhythmia at the time of death or prior to euthanasia. Hence, they were included in one group.The last limitation was a lack of assessment of atrial pressure in the examined dogs prior to the histopathologic examination in order to exclude its influence on atrial remodelling. We attempted to minimise the possibility of other reasons for atrial enlargement (e.g. mitral stenosis) by performing an accurate ante-mortem and post-mortem examination.</chapter><chapter title="Conclusion">Dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy show a different distribution of connective tissue, have less severe intra-myocardial arterial narrowing, and have more severe degenerative changes in the cardiomyocytes of the left atrium compared to dogs with chronic mitral valve disease. The changes noted in the atrial tissue from dogs in both groups resemble lesions noted in the ventricular tissue of dogs with the same diseases. Those differences may indicate that the atrial enlargement noted in DCM and CMVD has a different, disease-specific underlying mechanism and does not result only from volume overload.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700602"><title>Health system guidance appraisal&#8212;concept evaluation and usability testing</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Implementation Science : IS</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Denis E.</first-name><last-name>Ako-Arrey</last-name></author><author><first-name>Melissa C.</first-name><last-name>Brouwers</last-name></author><author><first-name>John N.</first-name><last-name>Lavis</last-name></author><author><first-name>Mita K.</first-name><last-name>Giacomini</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Research</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Background">Defining features of a health system can have a significant and direct impact on the health of individuals and communities [The achievement of health goals in several countries and regions has been hindered by a variety of challenges ranging from weak and dysfunctional health system features like existing delivery, financial, and governance arrangements [HSGs are systematically developed statements produced at global, national, and regional levels (e.g., by the World Health Organization, ministries and departments of health, and special committees supporting ministries and departments of health) that provide possible courses of action to address these challenges and thereby strengthen health systems [While HSG have led efforts to support low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), system-level guidance has increasingly been seen in higher-income countries too. Cancer Care Ontario (CCO), an advisory body to the province of Ontario, Canada on matters related to quality in cancer, has recently extended its reach to include a more systems-level perspective. CCO has developed several guidance documents designed to inform the organization and delivery of cancer services. For example, its Models of Systemic Therapy guidance document recommends a four-level provincial system to optimize access and decrease wait times to chemotherapy agents [Thus, HSG recommendations can help to determine appropriate ways to frame the problem of a population not having access to a primary care physician (e.g., supply, distribution, or payment problem), to outline viable options for health system arrangements that will strengthen primary care (e.g., financial and governance arrangements), to identify alternative implementation strategies that will get cost-effective programs, services, and drugs to those who need them, to monitor implementation efforts, and to evaluate their impacts [There are existing tools to support health systems. For example, while health system performance assessments (HSPA) report on the nature of a specific health problem, help prioritize topics, and evaluate achievements and progress towards HSG goals and recommendations [Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs)&#8212;guidance documents that target clinical questions and provide recommendations relevant to (primarily) clinician and patient decisions&#8212;could be considered conceptually equivalent knowledge tools to HSG. Both want to advance quality and improve outcomes, use relevant evidence appropriately, and ensure engagement of stakeholders to create implementable and sustainable solutions to health challenges. Optimizing health systems is a challenging task to which appropriate guidance can positively contribute, but there are conceptual and methodological issues unique to HSG that have compromised scientific advancement in this area [In contrast, there have been considerable advancements made regarding the science and practice of CPG development, appraisal, and reporting. For example, the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II tool [In response, we are conducting a multi-stage program of research with the input of international HSG experts in order to create a reliable, valid, and useful tool for the appraisal of HSG that can also be used to support HSG development and reporting. To fully understand the HSG landscape, stage 1 of this research project was a review aimed at generating a candidate list of concepts (items/domains/criteria) that could comprise a potential HSG appraisal tool. We completed the review (using a critical interpretive synthesis&#8212;CIS&#8212;approach) of the literature in order to identify any published studies that report on existing criteria currently used to describe, differentiate, or test the quality of HSG [Applying international standards of measurement design for item generation, face validation, and reduction [</chapter><chapter title="Methods">The approach used for this study was two-step structured surveys targeted at international stakeholders in HSG development and implementation processes. Ethics approval was received from the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (REB#14-334) and financial support received from a peer-review grant by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.For the purposes of this study, and with the goal to create a tool which had international and context relevance, we established an international advisory panel (AGREE HS Research team) comprised of researchers with expertise in strengthening health systems. Many of these advisors also had leadership roles in actual health systems (see the &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221; section). With respect to the actual study participants, we sought individuals representing each of the six WHO regions and with health system leadership roles from a government policy lens, clinical lens, and/or health administrator lens.A candidate pool of potential participant was created by three means: authors listed in publicly available HSG documents, attendees from the Global Symposium of Health Systems Research and the Guidelines International Network Symposium, and by individuals nominated by members of the research team. Each candidate participant was tagged by jurisdiction and type of expertise. The selected individuals made up a master list that served as the population from which participants were purposively sampled for both steps 1 and 2.For both step 1 and step 2, candidate participants from our master list stratified by location and expertise were invited to participate in the surveys. Letters of invitation, describing the studies, were e-mailed to participants to solicit their participation. Individuals who agreed to participate were e-mailed a password-protected unique identifier to log into a Web-based study platform (LimeSurvey&#174;) to complete the structured surveys. We also accommodated the requests of participants who preferred print packages of research materials. Our letters of invitation to participants outlined the purpose of the study, definition of key terms, likely time commitment, the survey process, and the expected output as well as conditions for participating. Periodic reminders were sent out to the invited participants over the study periods. The surveys were initially pilot-tested by some members of the scientific research team as well as some selected health services/systems researchers, to enable refinements prior to their distribution to consenting participants.During the 4-month study period for step 1, consenting survey participants were asked to evaluate each of the 30 candidate concepts for appropriateness to, relevance to, and priority for health system decisions and HSG. Each candidate concept was accompanied by an operational definition and considerations for scoring. Specifically, for each of the 30 concepts, participants were asked to rate their agreement with the following four key questions (measures):A 7-point scale (1, strongly disagree to 7, strongly agree) was used to rate each of the concepts for each of the questions. In addition, participants were provided with the opportunity to suggest refinements and modifications to each of the candidate concepts (i.e., labels, definitions, etc.) and to suggest additional concepts not addressed in the list. Participants were also asked to rate their overall agreement about the need for a high-quality tool aimed to systematically appraise HSG and contribute to HSG development and reporting. Demographic questions that captured the participants&#8217; gender, affiliation/organization, role/expertise, and years of experience were also included in the survey.Survey responses were downloaded into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and analyzed using Excel and SPSS. Overall descriptive analyses were calculated for each of the rated concepts (mean, standard deviation (SD), mode, median, and range). Items that 80&#160;% or more of the respondents rated favorably on each of the four measures (between 5 and 7 on the response scale) were maintained. Those that did not meet this threshold were prioritized for discussion. Additional concepts nominated by the participants were reviewed by the scientific team and reworked to align with the style and format of the other candidate concepts. Written feedback was reviewed and a thematic analysis was done. Final decisions regarding the concepts were made through consensus by the core and extended members of the scientific team. The final list of concepts was reformatted to create the beta version (draft) of the HSG appraisal tool.The emerging beta version (draft) of the HSG tool was comprised of 32 items clustered into 4 domains. During the 3-month study period for step 2, we collected data on stakeholders&#8217; experiences applying the draft tool on existing HSG documents. The object of inquiry for step 2 continued to be the tool and not the HSG documents themselves.We purposefully chose three WHO HSG documents from the McMaster University Health Forum&#8217;s Health System Evidence database (Consenting participants were randomly assigned one of the three HSG documents. Participants were asked to (a) review the HSG document to which they were assigned, (b) review the beta version of the HSG appraisal tool, (c) apply the beta version of the HSG appraisal tool to appraise the HSG document to which they were assigned, (d) answer a series of questions about the appraisal process (i.e., feedback), and (e) provide demographic information.For the application of the tool, participants indicated whether the concept reflected in each item was documented in the HSG being assessed. Each item was accompanied by an operational definition and a binary response scale (yes/no). For this survey, only 30 of the items on the tool were used to appraise the HSG. Two of the items (implementation plan and evaluation plan) were excluded for this exercise as they only refer to the end users and how they can design a detailed implementation and evaluation plan at the local level for their individual contexts.Subsequent to the rating of the HSG document, participants were asked to rate their overall agreement on the usability of the HSG appraisal tool as an instrument to systematically direct the development of HSG, to direct the appraisal of HSG, and to direct what needs to be reported in HSG (Yes/No/Uncertain response scale). The participants were also asked to rate the usability of the HSG appraisal tool: were the concepts easy to understand, easy to apply, and was the Yes/No scale appropriate? (7-point scale, strongly disagree-strongly agree). The participants were asked to provide any additional comments on the survey process, on the content of the candidate concepts (operational descriptions/definitions) presented, and on the HSG appraisal tool (perceptions of its usefulness, appropriateness, ease of application). Demographic questions that captured the participants&#8217; gender, affiliation/organization, role/position, years of experience, and previous participation in HSG development were also included.Survey responses were downloaded and analyzed using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Appropriate descriptive statistics were calculated for each of the question groups. The HSG appraisal tool scores were calculated (percentages of the Yes/No responses) and compared within and across the HSGs for exploratory purposes only. Usability of the HSG appraisal tool was assessed by calculating the percentages of Yes/No/Uncertain responses for each of the development, reporting, and evaluation metrics. Overall means were calculated on participants&#8217; ratings that the instrument was easy to understand, the instrument was easy to use, and the rating scale was appropriate. We reviewed the qualitative feedback received and performed a thematic analysis. Final decisions regarding the concepts and the generation of a refined HSG appraisal tool were made through consensus of the members of our scientific team.</chapter><chapter title="Results and discussion">Table&#160;Table&#160;As can be seen in Table&#160;&#8220;Political alignment&#8221; was the least favorable concept; for two of the measures, We also recorded an overwhelmingly high and consistent overall mean agreement in relation to the need for a high-quality tool to systematically direct the development of HSG (6.6), to systematically direct the appraisal of HSG (6.6), and to systematically direct the reporting of HSG (6.3). The standard deviations and the ranges recorded were low, and the modes and medians were 7 for all three categories.Considerable feedback was also provided by the participants regarding refinements and changes to the wordings of the concepts and their descriptions. However, no additional unique items were suggested by the participants. Using the results and feedback from the survey, reconsiderations of the raw data from the review, and a series of meetings with the core and expanded members of the team (The feedback from the survey and deliberations with members of the scientific team also led to the modification of the AGREE-HS framework that shows relationships between the concepts as well as relationships between clusters of the concepts (Fig.&#160;The beta version of the HSG appraisal tool concepts (labels and definitions), named AGREE Health Systems (AGREE-HS) is presented in Table&#160;Table&#160;With respect to AGREE-HS usability measures, participants reported an overall mean value of 5.9 and 5.6, respectively, when asked whether the concepts in the tool were easy to understand and were easy to apply. The standard deviations and the ranges were low, and the modes and medians were both 6 for these two items. In contrast, the mean ratings for the appropriateness of Yes/No scale were less favorable (4.1). Similar to step 1, there was affirmation that the AGREE-HS is a useful knowledge translation tool to systematically direct the development of HSG (85&#160;%), to systematically direct the appraisal of HSG (92&#160;%), and to systematically direct the reporting of HSG (81&#160;%).We received substantial qualitative feedback from the survey respondents regarding the overall usability of the AGREE-HS tool, suggestions for further refinements, and challenges regarding the Yes/No rating scale that was used. With respect to the latter, participants reported that the dichotomous Yes/No response scale was not appropriate and too constraining for the purposes of evaluation and recommended either a three-item response scale (Yes/No/Partially) or a Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). Feedback was incorporated into the tool to create the version 1.0 of the AGREE-HS tool (see Additional file </chapter><chapter title="Conclusions">In step 1 of our study, through a structured survey of relevant stakeholders from all six World Health Organization regions as well as feedback from members of our scientific team, we found that all the candidate concepts for the HSG tool met our a priori criteria for inclusion. Favorable ratings for each item emerged with each of the four target outcomes (i.e., to be included in HSG, to be part of HSG development, to be reported in HSG, and to a criteria on which to rate the quality of HSG). In addition, participants agreed that there was a need for an instrument of this type. These data with feedback led us to refine the HSG framework (Fig.&#160;In step 2, participants applied the beta version of the AGREE-HS to assess an HSG and provided feedback on the experience. Our findings showed favorable ratings on the usability of the tool. Items were reported to be easy to understand and easy to use. In contrast, the Yes/No response scale used in the beta version of the tool was not favorably rated. Corroborating findings in step 1, we again found strong support among the participants to create this tool and support for its contents. Finally, we found that in applying the beta version of the AGREE-HS to appraise the three HSG documents, variation in quality emerged between documents and across items, providing preliminary data in its ability to discriminate among HSG reports. Together, the data from step 2 led to refinements to the beta version of the tool. Our final product in this stage of the program of research is the HSG framework and the AGREE-HS version 1.0 (see Additional file A key strategy for the production of an acceptable HSG tool is to adhere to standard methodological quality criteria (e.g., usable, reliable, and valid) that confer on guidance the credibility to be used and adapted. This study adds to the existing literature by moving from the generated HSG quality criteria (concepts) to providing a foundation for a knowledge tool and a common analytic framework for health systems that can ultimately improve the HSG enterprise. Given the evidence base upon which the items were generated and two separate studies with knowledge users reporting their favorable support for the concepts, we believe that we have successfully established the face validity of this tool. We believe that this tool will facilitate informed decision-making about HSG at various levels and promoting a culture of informed HSG developers and consumers.We believe that this tool could be applied by policymakers and health system administrative leaders to differentiate between higher and lower quality HSGs that they might use to inform policy decisions and system redesign. We also believe that these stakeholders could serve as important promoters in elevating the quality of HSG and use of evidence in health system thinking by making the AGREE-HS an expectation among the development community from whom they receive HSG. Developers can use the AGREE-HS as a blue print for their HSG methodological protocols and user manuals with respect to development and reporting expectations. Educators and researchers can use the AGREE-HS as a teaching tool to help learners acquire skills related to health systems.A strength of this study is that it involved a multidisciplinary blend of international participants recruited based on geography and expertise in order to cover various perspectives and jurisdictions. Secondly, it involved a high-quality approach adapted from the methodological, conceptual, and theoretical principles of measurement construction used to design a complementary tool, AGREE II, which aims to facilitate the development, appraisal, and reporting of clinical practice guidelines. Our methodology was sequential (one step led to the next), differentiated (each step represented a distinctive study required to move to the next step), and cumulative (each step produced data that fed into the overall process). Thirdly, it involved an iterative collaborative process with members of our core and expanded team comprised of investigators and collaborators with an extensive knowledge in health system and policy research. Fourthly, we recruited qualified participants worldwide to ensure that the study resonates with low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Lastly, we asked a wide variety of broad questions that permitted an understanding of the various dimensions of the usefulness of the tool as well as potential areas where issues may arise.A limitation of this study was that the sample size meant that we did not have sufficient power to also conduct a factor analysis to determine the clustering of items. While not part of the scope of this study, a factor analysis is an important step in the development of a measurement tool [The next steps of our research program involve developing a user manual with more explanations and detailed examples, as well as developing an on-line training program that will be useful for potential users of the tool. We will also proceed with further usability testing, reliability testing, validity testing, and refinement of the AGREE-HS version 1.0 in order to generate the alpha version ready for international unveiling and branding. Of particular interest will be to test its construct validity, its reliability, and its applicability to the various HSGs that exist. We also plan to promote the use of the tool internationally to groups who develop HSG and collate HSG in on-line system directories. The AGREE-HS will join the AGREE family of tools aimed to promote the use of evidence-informed guidance (see </chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700603"><title>SHP2 acts both upstream and downstream of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases to promote basal-like and triple-negative breast cancer</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Breast Cancer Research : BCR</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Fatimah</first-name><last-name>Matalkah</last-name></author><author><first-name>Elisha</first-name><last-name>Martin</last-name></author><author><first-name>Hua</first-name><last-name>Zhao</last-name></author><author><first-name>Yehenew M.</first-name><last-name>Agazie</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Research Article</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Introduction">Of all breast cancer subtypes, basal-like and triple-negative breast cancer (BTBC) is the most aggressive form, causing disproportionately high mortality in women [EGFR belongs to a family of RTKs that includes EGFR itself, EGFR2, EGFR3, and EGFR4.

With the exception of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), all members are activated by ligand binding to the extracellular domain, and all except HER3 have a functional tyrosine kinase domain in the cytoplasmic regions. Activation leads to homo- or heterodimerization at the cell surface and transphosphorylation in the C-terminal tail in the cytoplasm [Because EGFR is a potent activator of mitogenic and cell survival signaling, its overexpression in cancer is suggested to contribute to tumorigenesis [We recently demonstrated that SHP2 promotes the transformation and invasive property of BTBC cells [</chapter><chapter title="Materials and methods">MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MCF-10A cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA), and the mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were received from Dr. Steven Frisch (West Virginia University).

Surprisingly, we found that the level of EGFR in the SHP2-silenced cells was very low in the first place and rapidly degraded upon EGF stimulation (Additional file On the basis of the data shown in Fig.&#160;To corroborate the effect of SHP2 on EGFR protein stability, we studied the dynamics of ligand-induced EGFR degradation after stabilizing EGFR with chloroquine. Analysis of total cell lysates showed rapid EGFR degradation in the SHP2-silenced cells and less rapid degradation in the controls (Fig.&#160;To confirm the immunoblotting findings, we conducted time course fluorescence studies after stabilizing EGFR as described above (see The hypersensitivity of EGFR to ligand-induced degradation in the SHP2-silenced cells was indicative of enhanced EGFR ubiquitination. We tested this possibility after stabilizing EGFR with chloroquine and stimulating with EGF for 2, 5, or 10&#160;min, a time range that shows maximal receptor ubiquitination. On one hand, EGFR was ubiquitinated even in the basal state in the SHP2-silenced cells, which increased upon EGF stimulation. On the other hand, EGFR ubiquitination in the controls was undetectable in the basal state and weakly detectable after EGF stimulation (Fig.&#160;Because lysosome inhibition did not lead to complete restoration of EGFR, we reasoned that SHP2 might also promote EGFR expression at an mRNA level. qRT-PCR analysis showed that silencing SHP2 expression led to a 9&#8211;10-fold decrease in EGFR mRNA level (Fig.&#160;On the basis of the data shown in Figs.&#160;Scores of 3+ and 2+ for each protein were considered as positive for elevated expression.

In these analyses, we also paid particular attention to heterogeneous regions in each tumor. Compared with the normal-looking regions, overexpression of EGFR and SHP2 increased with tumor progression. Representative IF pictures from two cases are shown in Fig.&#160;We also determined the state of EGFR and SHP2 expression in multiple BTBC cell lines (BT-20, BT-549, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468) to confirm the IHC and IF findings.

To test this possibility, we compared the relative biological significance of SHP2 and EGFR in BTBC cells. First, the expression of EGFR was silenced using two shRNA constructs (Fig.&#160;We also compared the effect of SHP2 and EGFR silencing on anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. On one hand while the parental and the control cells formed larger and more numerous colonies, the SHP2-silenced cells formed smaller and fewer ones (Fig.&#160;The inability of the SHP2-silenced cells to grow in soft agar indicated a role for SHP2 in cancer stem cell (CSC) biology.

We also show that SHP2 mediates the expression and signaling activities of multiple RTKs, including EGFR, FGFR1, and c-Met, to promote BTBC. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that SHP2 acts both upstream and downstream of RTKs to promote their oncogenic signaling. This effect of SHP2 might be responsible for its superior role compared with EGFR inhibition. Subsequent studies are needed to answer some of the questions raised in this report.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700604"><title>Developing an integrated framework of problem-based learning and coaching psychology for medical education: a participatory research</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>BMC Medical Education</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Qing</first-name><last-name>Wang</last-name></author><author><first-name>Huiping</first-name><last-name>Li</last-name></author><author><first-name>Weiguo</first-name><last-name>Pang</last-name></author><author><first-name>Shuo</first-name><last-name>Liang</last-name></author><author><first-name>Yiliang</first-name><last-name>Su</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Research Article</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Background">Problem-based learning (PBL) is essentially a strategic learning system that represents a major shift in the educational paradigm from teacher-centred to student-centred learning. It aims to enhance collaborative, contextual, integrated, self-directed and reflective learning [As an instructional method pervasively employed in medical education [From an instructive perspective, PBL emphasises the importance of understanding not only content but also disciplinary epistemologies and investigative strategies through collaborative problem solving and sense making, reflecting on experiences, developing evidence-based explanations, communicating ideas, enhancing discipline-specific reasoning skills and engaging in self-directed inquiry [The non-directive facilitative approach is particularly related to the perspective of coaching psychology, which is epistemologically based on humanistic philosophy. Coaching psychology focuses on &#8216;enhancing well-being and performance in personal life and work domains underpinned by models of coaching grounded in established learning theories or psychological approaches&#8217; [Coaching psychologists believe that knowledge needs to be personally appropriated and that this goal can be achieved through a specific type of encounter between the coach and the learners. The responsibility for solving the problems, learning and growing rests with the learners rather than with the coach. Evidence has shown that incorporating coaching psychology into an inquiry-based learning process is beneficial in terms of optimising students&#8217; learning experience; scaffolding the inquiry process; developing positive learning dispositions; and fostering students&#8217; learning relationships, autonomy, self-awareness and learning agency [Coaching psychology and PBL differ in various aspects in that one is a sub-discipline in the field of psychology and the other is a learning methodology. For example, coaching psychology considers the qualities and characteristics of coaches from a humanistic perspective, whereas in PBL, tutors&#8217; personal qualities are not considered to be a main factor. However, there are several common threads running through the review of PBL and coaching psychology. Philosophically, they are both grounded in social constructionism, which is concerned with how learners construct new knowledge and build their own mental structures through social interaction with other people and their environment. Theoretically, they both explicitly stress the developmental, situated nature of the learning process and learners&#8217; meaning making and reflection based on their self-directedness and self-determination. In practice, they both emphasise experiential learning, which refers to using an authentic method of achieving understanding through confronting problems and exploring solutions in real learning contexts. Furthermore, they both acknowledge the importance of learning facilitators, i.e., coaches, tutors or mentors, who play an essential role in supporting learners in their own learning and development. Therefore, we posit that PBL and coaching psychology share an affinity in terms of learning facilitation.The literature on coaching in PBL is limited, although some researchers have touched on the subject. Barrows and Tamblyn offered their vision of a PBL tutor as a metacognitive coach and mentor [The nature of PBL is moving towards a In the context of Chinese medical education, there are very few studies of PBL within a visualised model clarifying interrelated factors in the process. Liu and his colleagues developed a PBL model that integrates students, tutors and patients in a real clinical context [This study aimed to explore a new framework that integrates essential features of current PBL and the perspective of coaching psychology in the wider context of Chinese medical education using a participatory research approach. We expected the integrated framework to be applicable to the PBL process, particularly in PBL tutorial settings. We combined research goals and action goals because they contributed to establishing a learning community and generating valid data [</chapter><chapter title="Methods">The overall design was informed by participatory research. Participatory research is &#8216;an orientation to inquiry&#8217; and can be regarded as a methodology that argues in favour of the significance and usefulness of involving research partners in a knowledge-production process that is reflexive, flexible and iterative [Four educational psychology researchers and ten participants from a medical school in East China participated in the research. Participants included four second-year medical students (two females and two males) who nearly finished their first PBL module at the medical school, four final-year medical students (three females and one male) who finished a series of PBL modules during their university education and two Respiratory doctors (one female and one male) who were professionally trained as accredited PBL tutors with a minimum of three years of PBL experience. They participated in the research voluntarily and completed the entire research process. The participants were each given 500 RMB as compensation for their time and efforts.The research programme consisted of four workshops held from October 2014 to January 2015. The first workshop began with an introductory session on the research framework, followed by a discussion of the current PBL curriculum in the medical school and the main concepts of coaching psychology. In the second workshop, we explored the fit between the adoption of coaching psychology and PBL, blended features of coaching into a PBL curriculum and developed draft models. The third workshop focused on investigating the advantages and the limitations of the draft models, advancing the discussion towards a more integrated model and practicing essential coaching skills and techniques. The final workshop concentrated on modifying and refining the integrated model and ended with implementation plans. During the discussions in the workshops, the research team and the participants were divided into two groups, each with a mix of students, tutors and research team members. Key learning points were summarised at the end of each workshop to aid personal reflection, provide continuity and guide participants towards the next workshop.At the end of the research programme, participants were asked to provide feedback on the workshops. The feedback was generally very positive; participants reported a better understanding of PBL and coaching psychology, mastery of coaching skills and techniques and increased confidence in the implementation of the new model. The participants stated that they were highly engaged and motivated in the group discussion and collaborative creation of the model and felt as though they were creative and energetic. They reported that the participatory research approach provided a friendly, open and safe learning environment that allowed them to share opinions and challenged them to engage in deep thinking.The research protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of East China Normal University and Tongji University. All participants completed informed consent forms that included an introduction of the overall programme and explanations of the commitment involved in participation. All participants were reassured of the confidentiality of the data and that their course evaluations would not be impacted if they chose to withdraw from the study. It was acknowledged that in small-scale and highly specific participatory research, it might be difficult to protect individuals&#8217; identity. To address this concern, all members of the group signed a confidentiality agreement.Data were primarily collected through qualitative methods. We video-recorded our participatory observation of the participants&#8217; conversations, behaviours and interactional patterns in each workshop. We conducted and video-recorded four focus groups and eight semi-structured interviews and collected participants&#8217; notes, posters, PPT and other relevant documents. These methods were complemented by the collection of some descriptive quantitative data gathered from the evaluation forms at the end of the programme. Of note, some of the data collection and analysis processes were interactive and continuous in a spiral form that enabled us to reflect on the previous analytical results and alter actions in the next phase of data collection.The data analysis process was inspired by Glaser and Strauss&#8217; grounded theory [</chapter><chapter title="Results">In this section, we briefly present the key findings that emerged from the thematic content analysis. Due to word count restrictions, direct quotes from the participants are limited and incorporated into the text.The participants had a thorough discussion about the strengths and limitations of and expected improvements to the existing PBL curriculum at the Medical School of Tongji University. The comments are summarised in Tables&#160;The tutor-student relationships were found to be interactive and multi-faceted. Generally, the nature of the relationships varied depending on Meanwhile, comments on tutors&#8217; indirect roles described them as &#8216;supporters&#8217;, &#8216;mentors&#8217;, &#8216;coaches&#8217;, &#8216;facilitators&#8217;, &#8216;participants&#8217; and &#8216;friends&#8217;.The tutors embraced the PBL philosophy and acknowledged that they were co-learners with the students.The students&#8217; roles varied based on their individual differences, level of participation and group interaction. The students adopted roles as explorers, knowledge seekers, problem solvers, inquirers and presenters working in a team.The evidence regarding student group dynamics was gathered from conversations and non-verbal behaviours in observations. The diversity (e.g., gender, educational background, personal characteristics) of individual members contributed greatly to the advancement of the participatory learning process and creativity of actions. Group members might change their perspectives on what it meant to work together towards a goal and change their understanding of their learning relationships with each other.When drafting the models, the students were collaborative and friendly to each other and concerned with the protection of their products. We noticed that only one student was dissatisfied with the draft model created in his group and, thus, provided an individual draft; he was encouraged by the tutors to express his thoughts to his group members and join in the collaborative work.The tutors functioned as group facilitators to manage group dynamics and discussions. They also participated in drafting the model by sharing their experience of PBL tutoring and highlighting the critical elements that should be included in the model.Participants agreed that the students should develop self-directed and self-regulated learning ability, be responsible for their own learning and actively participate in the process of knowledge construction and meaning making. When students applied self-directedness and self-regulation, they developed identities as learners with ownership over what they had learned and a sense of agency in terms of how they learn.Some participants mentioned that their experience involved a problem of role conflict with deeply ingrained habits that they had developed through more familiar classroom experiences in which they were passive recipients of knowledge and rules in clinical practice. They reported that PBL presented challenges that allowed them to become intrinsically motivated, set goals, plan a course of action, select appropriate strategies, and self-monitor and self-evaluate their learning.Tutors were responsible for initiating a positive learning environment that embraced, encouraged and fostered effective self-directed learning. Tutors were encouraged to implement the PBL philosophy as soon as possible, cultivate positive learning dispositions and higher-order learning skills and develop a healthy expectation of students.The participants showed a great interest in coaching psychology theories, concepts, models, skills and techniques. They agreed that explicitly and intentionally adopting a coaching psychology perspective helped to clarify the tutors&#8217; roles and processes in PBL facilitation.Coaching psychology was reported to help the participants both personally and professionally.In addition, the participants actively generated ways to employ coaching skills and techniques in various settings such as flexible usage of open and closed questions, empathetic listening, positive feedback, perspective taking, etc.Paradoxically, the students claimed that although coaching is beneficial, they still prefer some didactic learning alongside the opportunity to exercise critical thinking.</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">In this study, the participants discovered the meaning of coaching psychology and PBL experience, inquired about the roots of the preconceptions of PBL problems in Chinese medical education and formulated a new pedagogical framework through a series of democratic and transformative meaning-making processes. This unorthodox approach fundamentally changed the role of participants from subjects of psychological studies to co-owners of the research process and product [The model shares some common key elements of PBL with other established models that we have reviewed. However, the model that emerged from the data has a number of innovative aspects, particularly in the Chinese medical educational context, and it appears to reflect a general, comprehensive approach rather than merely a tutorial process. There are a number of contributions that coaching psychology brings to the existing PBL approach, as indicated by the C&#8201;+&#8201;PBL model.We explicitly address the following four points: i) the new model regards empathy and medical humanity as one of the key learning goals in PBL tutorials; ii) it emphasises not only the cognitive scaffolding mentioned in the earlier PBL studies but also the emotional scaffolding overlooked by previous studies; iii) it recognises the multiplicity of roles that tutors adopt during the PBL tutorial and gives more weight to the balance between the roles of knowledge experts and academic coaches; and, finally, iv) it addresses mutual feedback and communication between tutors and students in a democratic, collaborative learning environment.These ideas may not be entirely new and have been covered in some specific PBL approaches adopted in various institutions. However, our research results and the feedback from the participants highlighted that Chinese medical tutors and administrative committees in the medical schools have not paid much attention to these points or have done so only at a superficial level. We make strong claims that these four points are essential for supporting medical students&#8217; and tutors&#8217; personal and professional development.The C&#8201;+&#8201;PBL Model (Fig.&#160;During The C&#8201;+&#8201;PBL model explicitly considers empathy and humanistic concerns as one of the learning goals in medical education. Empathy is recognised as a central element in achieving positive health care outcomes [An The C&#8201;+&#8201;PBL model indicates a learning-centred coaching process that is similar to what Gyori called a &#8216;three-mode process of mentorship&#8217; [This model emphasises that the tutor needs to act as a coach, playing a balanced role as an expert in both the subject matter and in facilitating students&#8217; learning process [To successfully apply the C&#8201;+&#8201;PBL Model, the tutor should acquire the basic attitudes, beliefs, characteristics and skills necessary for any PBL curriculum, such as supporting metacognitive development and strategic and reflective questioning; modulating the level of challenge of the learning to meet student requirements; and monitoring students&#8217; educational progress and group dynamics [From a cognitive perspective, students need to integrate, possess and apply a large amount of domain knowledge during the problem-solving process; thus, students&#8217; cognitive loads are expected to increase over the course of PBL [Emotional scaffolding is important for guiding students through the frustration, lack of confidence, emotional issues and teamwork problems that they might experience during PBL [Due to the complex and multi-skilled nature of scaffolding, some tutors are unsure of how to determine the appropriate time to intervene and how the balance between too much and too little structure with each unique PBL group. Successful scaffolding is largely dependent on the availability and skills of tutors who know when and how to adopt facilitation strategies [The C&#8201;+&#8201;PBL Model emphasises mutual feedback between the tutor and the students. The on-going feedback can be categorised into two types: specific feedback and general feedback. Specific feedback refers to asking questions to prompt thinking instead of providing direct guidance or correcting errors, offering suggestions and pointing the students to a specific resource for additional information about certain concepts. This kind of feedback requires the tutor to observe students&#8217; level of understanding and respond accordingly in a student-centred environment [The main challenges of the new framework involve implementation and evaluation issues. Although the participants felt confident in the successful implementation of the model, incorporating it into the existing medical educational system is a great challenge that correlates, to some extent, with reported difficulties (e.g., too time-consuming, lack of staff, students might feel compulsion) in implementing PBL in Asian countries [The alignment between learning activities and assessments is crucial for participation in PBL [</chapter><chapter title="Conclusions">This article describes the process of developing a new framework integrating features of PBL and the perspective of coaching psychology through a participatory research approach within the context of Chinese medical education. It attempts to develop a systematic model that leads to more efficient, satisfying and long-lasting professional capacities that increase throughout the effective PBL tutorial process. We have successfully fulfilled the aim by presenting the following strengths. The participatory and dialogic research approach offered the participants opportunities to be creative, collaborate and take personal responsibility and, in many ways, resembled some of the features of their professional clinic-related practice. The triangulation of data collected from observations, focus groups, interviews and documents as well as the independent coding during data analysis enhanced the credibility and trustworthiness of the research. In this paper, we provide a rich description of an integrated model of PBL and coaching psychology. The C&#8201;+&#8201;PBL Model differs from the current PBL approach in that it explicitly addresses empathy and medical humanity as one of key learning goals in medical education, the tutors&#8217; roles as knowledge experts and learning coaches for the students, cognitive and emotional scaffolding strongly grounded in psychological theories and effective mutual feedback between the tutors and students. Although it is in its infancy, the new model could be regarded as giving a sense of achievement and direction for further implementation. We anticipate that our investigations are useful in two ways. First, the C&#8201;+&#8201;PBL Model could serve to stimulate consideration and debate as institutions develop their own PBL concepts and procedures. Second, our study provides insights into incorporating coaching skills into professional development programmes for PBL tutors and PBL curricula for students.In addition to its strengths and contributions, our study is subject to several limitations. A comparatively small group of medical students and tutors participated in the research programme; thus, the findings might not be generalisable to other research fields. The participatory research workshops generated a large amount and diversity of data that might be overwhelming to analyse. The third limitation was the restricted resources and time and participants&#8217; different agendas, which made it difficult for us to include all the participants in the final data analysis stage. However, the research could be seen as one part of a collective, on-going learning journey and we would use the feedback from the participants to improve the research programme in the future.An important next step of this study is to closely investigate the process of how tutors and students incorporate the framework into their learning using real clinical cases, ideally comparing a group that adopts the C&#8201;+&#8201;PBL Model with a group that follows a traditional PBL curriculum. A fine-grained examination of the process of each phase of the model, with video analysis documenting tutors&#8217; interventions and students&#8217; responses, thematic analysis of contextually designed questions and statistical analysis of measurements on the development of learning dispositions and capabilities, is needed. This topic deserves substantial attention and continuous efforts to advance the PBL approach in Chinese medical education.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700605"><title>Effects of nateglinide and rosiglitazone on pancreatic alpha- and beta-cells, GLP-1 secretion and inflammatory markers in patients with type 2 diabetes: randomized crossover clinical study</title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Diabetology &amp; Metabolic Syndrome</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Glauce Cordeiro Ulh&#244;a</first-name><last-name>Tostes</last-name></author><author><first-name>Maria Ros&#225;rio</first-name><last-name>Cunha</last-name></author><author><first-name>Rosa Tsumeshiro</first-name><last-name>Fukui</last-name></author><author><first-name>M&#225;rcia Regina Silva</first-name><last-name>Correia</last-name></author><author><first-name>Dalva Marreiro</first-name><last-name>Rocha</last-name></author><author><first-name>Rosa Ferreira</first-name><last-name>dos Santos</last-name></author><author><first-name>Maria Elizabeth Rossi</first-name><last-name>da Silva</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Research</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Background">Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The rigorous control of glycemia can delay but not prevent vascular complications, which are probably related to many other poorly controlled atherogenic factors, such as obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, accelerated aging, disturbances in coagulation and fibrinolysis [Although metformin has been confirmed as the first line option to treat diabetes, troublesome gastrointestinal intolerance sometimes precludes its use [Rosiglitazone and nateglinide are drugs that differ in their primary mechanism of action and have been previously considered in type 2 diabetes treatment.The thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#947;) agonist, is an insulin sensitizing agent that improves glycaemic control and a variety of other metabolic disturbances in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, besides weight gain, it promoted fluid retention and heart failure [Another alternative option to therapy can be the insulin secretagogue nateglinide [Furthermore, nateglinide has little binding to the vascular muscle and cardiac SUR2 receptors [To the best knowledge of nateglinide effects we conducted this study comparing the effects of nateglinide with rosiglitazone on glucose and lipid profile, but also on several parameters still not well characterized like pancreatic alpha and beta cells response to diet, the incretin hormone GLP-1, inflammatory markers, and haemostatic factors. The purpose of the current study was also to ascertain whether anti-diabetic agents with different primary mechanisms of action targeting the two main pathophysiological defects of type 2 diabetes would have different effects on these parameters and if they were independent of glucose control.</chapter><chapter title="Methods">A prospective study was performed in 22 patients with type 2 diabetes according to ADA criteria [Participants were randomly assigned to receive either nateglinide (nateglinide group) or rosiglitazone (rosiglitazone group). The rosiglitazone dosage was titrated in order to achieve fasting glucose levels lower than 7.0&#160;mmol/L using domiciliary capillary glucose measurements. Nateglinide was administrated in a fixed dose three times a day. After 4&#160;months, the patients were crossed-over after 8-week washout period to the alternative treatment for an additional 4-month period on a similar dosage schedule. Subjects were followed on an outpatient basis every 1&#8211;2&#160;weeks for drug and weight-maintaining diet adjustments throughout the study period. The clinical characteristics of the patients are depicted in Table&#160;The Medical Ethics Committee of Hospital das Cl&#237;nicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S&#227;o Paulo approved the study protocol and all subjects gave written informed consent.The patients were instructed to follow similar food intake and to abstain from use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee and any physical activity 24-h before the test days. The following procedures were performed before (basal values) and after each 4&#160;months treatment period (nateglinide or rosiglitazone groups): (1) hormonal and metabolic determinations: a test with a standardized 500-kcal mixed breakfast tolerance test (60&#160;% carbohydrate, 20&#160;% fat and 20&#160;% protein) for 5&#160;h including frequent plasma or serum measurements (at times 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300&#160;min) of glucose, insulin, glucagon, proinsulin, GLP-1, free fat acids (FFA), and triglycerides levels was performed after 12&#160;h fasting. The fasting lipid profile and HbAGlucose levels were determined by the glucose oxidase/peroxidase method (Labtest, S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by HPLC (National Glyco Hemoglobin Standardization Program, USA. Triglyceride levels were measured by the lipase/glycerol kinase method (Labtest, S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil) and total cholesterol (total-C) by the cholesterol oxidase/peroxidase method. HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) was separated using the phosphotungstic acid/MgHaemostatic factors were measured using the same assay for each patient. Fibrinogen was determined by the CLAUSS method [Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) values were assessed by 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring in all patients every 20&#160;min from 8.00 a.m. to midnight, and every 30&#160;min from midnight to 8.00 a.m. in the following day.All analyses were done in duplicate.Numerical data were reported as mean and standard deviation or median and percentile. Differences (95&#160;% CI) between treatment groups were initially tested for treatment-time interaction [</chapter><chapter title="Results and discussion">No treatment period interaction effect was demonstrated; hence the values from each treatment periods were analyzed together. Two patients that started with rosiglitazone did not finished the nateglinide period due to a worsening in diabetes control. The final analysis comprised 20 patients on rosiglitazone and 20 patients on nateglinide.There were no significant differences (p&#160;&gt;&#160;0.05) in baseline clinical and biochemical measurements of those patients randomized to nateglinide or rosiglitazone (Table&#160;HbA1 levels fell (nateglinide-p&#160;=&#160;0.032; rosiglitazone-p&#160;=&#160;0.036) equally in both treatment groups (p&#160;=&#160;0.91).

Both treatments caused a similar decrease in total and incremental prandial glucose AUCs (Table&#160;However, there were significant between-treatment difference for the following parameters: rosiglitazone decreased glucose levels significantly at all times of the curve, including fasting, whereas nateglinide decreased mainly the post prandial glucose levels (Fig.&#160;The initial insulin response to a meal was anticipated and augmented with nateglinide treatment (Fig.&#160;On the contrary, rosiglitazone decreased insulin (incremental) and proinsulin (total) AUCs and increased HOMA beta. Comparing both groups, rosiglitazone treatment caused lower total (p&#160;=&#160;0.012) and incremental (p&#160;=&#160;0.005) insulin AUC, incremental (p&#160;=&#160;0.023) pro-insulin AUC and insulinogenic index (p&#160;=&#160;0.002), but higher incremental glucose/insulin ratio AUC (p&#160;=&#160;0.042) Table&#160;Considering lipids, Rosiglitazone decrease prandial FFA (total AUC) and triglyceride (incremental AUC) (Table&#160;Only rosiglitazone decreased PAI-1 activity, fibrinogen, PCR and TGF-&#946; levels (Table&#160;There was no significant effect of either of the therapies on glucagon or GLP-1 AUCs (Table&#160;Weight and waist/hip ratio did not change after 4&#160;months of both treatments.Neither therapy changed 24-h systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements.</chapter><chapter title="Discussions">This clinical, prospective, randomized, crossover study compared the effects of two different classes of drugs (rosiglitazone, an insulin sensitizer, and nateglinide, an insulin secretagogue) in type 2 diabetes patient. We evaluated the same patient under basal conditions, i.e., while hyperglycemic without medications, and again after 4&#160;months of treatment with nateglinide or rosiglitazone. The major aims of this strategy was to minimize the influence of metabolic control on the specific drug effect. Despite similar improvements on glucose control, changes on lipid profile, insulin response and inflammatory markers were different with therapies.Both treatment groups achieved similar and significant mean decreases from baseline in plasma glucose and fasting HbA1c levels. Proportions of patients achieving an endpoint HbA1c of&#160;&lt;7&#160;% were similar for nateglinide and rosiglitazone groups. Initial insulin response to the 5&#160;h standardized 500 calories breakfast was augmented only with nateglinide treatment. The higher insulin and proinsulin levels, observed during nateglinide therapy, are in line with reports of its stimulatory effects on beta cells function, favoring a quick onset and short duration of insulin secretion, contrasting with the rosiglitazone&#8217;s sparing effects on beta cells function [Similar results were seen with proinsulin levels during the meal test: increased with nateglinide and decreased with rosiglitazone.So, both treatment affected beta cell function. Despite increasing insulin secretion, the pro-insulin/insulin area under the curve ratio during the 5&#160;h of the breakfast decreased during nateglinide treatment, suggesting that it improved previous secretory dysfunction of beta cells, contrasting with the worsening in beta cells function usually reported to sulphonylureas [Rosiglitazone also improved beta cells function, attested by the increase in HOMA-B value. Despite causing lower prandial insulin response, rosiglitazone kept total and incremental glucose AUC at similar levels when compared with nateglinide.Overall changes on plasma lipids levels were different with therapies. Only rosiglitazone decreased post-prandial FFA and of triglycerides levels, both of which probably accounted to the observed amelioration of beta cell function (HOMA-B) and of insulin resistance, reflecting on the glucose-lowering action of rosiglitazone.By the other side, nateglinide decreased fasting cholesterol levels, that were lower than with rosiglitazone treatment (p&#160;=&#160;0.04).Small changes in lipid metabolism were expected, and previous reports have also been light [Besides improvements on plasma FFA levels and HOMA beta, rosiglitazone treatment decreased CRP, TGF beta and fibrinogen levels and PAI-1 activity. These data suggest drug specific effects, not dependent on amelioration of the metabolic milieu.Inflammatory markers and other haemostatic factor (IL-6, TNF alpha, leptin, s-ICAM, platelet aggregation) were unaffected by both treatment, despite the great improvement in glucose profile, Such persistence in inflammation is probably implicated in the poor reduction in cardiovascular disease despite glucose control in type 2 diabetes patients [No changes were observed in GLP-1 levels during both therapies. A reduced incretin effect is a well-known characteristic of patients with type 2 diabetes. Impaired release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been reported to be at least partly involved in impairment of early-phase insulin secretion after food intake and postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia [High concentrations of several antidiabetic drug classes, namely thiazolidinediones, sulphonylureas, meglitinides and morphilinoguanides have been reported to inhibit the DPP-IV enzyme, being nateglinide the strongest inhibitor. So, besides its effect as a beta-cell K-ATP channel inhibitor [We did not confirm these data in our study.There was no change in blood pressure. Nateglinide, probably due to its little binding to the vascular muscle and cardiac SUR2 receptors [Although metformin has been confirmed as the first line option to treat diabetes, troublesome gastrointestinal intolerance sometimes precludes its use [</chapter><chapter title="Conclusions">In patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by dietary therapy, nateglinide and rosiglitazone resulted in similar overall improvements in glucose control and beta cell function.

Locus AcA59 was also the most polymorphic, with allele frequencies ranging from 0.19 to 0.36, and a maximum value at all test sites.

AAV2 and AAV8 are the closest parental vectors of AAV-DJ and most of the amino acid residues are similar between the capsids of these three vectors.

Briefly, twenty 150-mmTo assess the efficacy of the mutant vectors we generated, 293&#160;T, Hela and HepG2 cells were either mock infected or infected with 1000 vector genomes (vg)/cell of AAV-DJ-GFP or its K/S/T mutant vectors. At 48&#160;h post-transduction, GFP expression was observed and imaged on an Olympus Model BX41 fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and the GFP positive efficiency and mean fluorescent signal intensities (MFI) were measured by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur, BD, USA).Male C57BL/6 mice of 6&#8211;8 weeks were obtained and housed in the animal center of the Academy of Military Medicine Science. To evaluate the gene expression level at different time points and the biodistribution of these four vectors after tail vein injection, we used dual luciferase reporter system for the in vivo study. Animals were either mock-injected or injected with 1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10For gene expression level assay, blood was collected via the tail at day 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 post-vector administrations. The secretory Gaussia princeps luciferase (Gluc) activity was measured using BioLux&#174; Gaussia Luciferase Flex Assay Kit (New England Biolabs) at different time point during the experiment. For each group, the relative light unit (RLU) was determined for all the animals at each time-point. The RLU value is related to Gluc expression.After the last blood collection, mice were anaesthetized by pentobarbital sodium (1&#160;%, 40&#160;mg/kg mice) via intraperitoneal injection. The D-luciferin substrate (Biotium, Hayward, CA) was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 150&#160;&#956;g/g. The mice were then placed in a light-tight chamber, and images were generated using a Bioanalytical Instruments (Berthold Technologies, DE). Light was monitored in all of the experiments described at 8&#8211;12&#160;min after the substrate injection. The visual output represents the number of photons emitted/second as a false color image where the maximum is red and the minimum is dark blue.After bioluminescence imaging, mice were killed and tissue samples were collected from each group. Genomic DNA was isolated using the TIANamp Genomic DNA Kit (TIANGEN BIOTECH CO., LTD, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s protocol.

There may be several factors that contributed to the in vitro results. As demonstrated by Aslanidi et al., a multiple mutant of AAV2 led to ~24-fold higher efficiency in in vitro gene transduction, which was mainly because the combined mutants had better ability for escaping ubiquitination then resulting in more nuclear translocation and more transgene expression [Recently, some conflicting results were reported on the same residue mutants of different AAV serotypes. For example, the Y to F mutants of AAV2 can dramatically enhance gene transfer and expression both in vitro and in vivo [In summary, the AAV-DJ capsid mutants (S503A/T251A) generated in this study led to significant improvements in systemic transgene expression and exhibited liver tropism after tail vein injection in mice.

CMV is highly prevalent in all parts of the world and infection rates increase with age, with seropositivity estimated between 50 and 95&#160;% in those aged over 5&#160;years [Although CMV rarely leads to overt clinical problems after primary infection, it is believed that subclinical episodes of CMV reactivation occur frequently during a lifetime but are rapidly controlled by the host immune response [The sites of CMV latency include haemopoietic stem cells, monocytes and epithelial cells. However the level of CMV within the blood is very low and conventional PCR assays are almost invariably negative in healthy donors [The use of highly sensitive PCR assays increases the frequency of CMV detection and nested PCR offers the advantage of substantial sensitivity but is poorly quantitative. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a new approach that provides a highly sensitive and direct method for detection of target DNA without the need for developing a &#8216;standard curve&#8217;. ddPCR emulsifies an oil-based PCR reaction into thousands of droplets, each of which then acts as a PCR micro-reaction and increases the chances of a rare event being detected. Using Poisson&#8217;s distribution, a direct measurement of the target DNA can then be determined. ddPCR does not therefore rely on any interpretation of rate-based data, as is the case with Q-PCR. The sensitivity and versatility of ddPCR for detection of low copy number events has been shown in several settings and is increasingly part of clinical practice for monitoring mutations levels in malignant disease [We have utilized purification of monocytes combined with droplet digital PCR to permit accurate quantification of the level of CMV within the blood of healthy donors. Our data showed that this provides a highly informative technique to quantify CMV viral load. Moreover they revealed that virus is found infrequently within the blood until the age of around 70&#160;years when it becomes detectable in every donor. We showed that virus is present exclusively within the &#8216;classical&#8217; CD14+ monocyte fraction and that the increase in viral load correlated with a decrease in the cellular immune response to immediate early protein. These findings have important implications for understanding the biology and clinical complications of CMV infection.</chapter><chapter title="Results">Blood samples were obtained from 44 healthy donors between 25 and 86&#160;years of age. CD14+ monocytes were purified by positive selection using magnetic beads and then DNA was extracted using miniprep kits. CMV-specific PCR primers and droplet digital PCR analysis (ddPCR) was then used to determine the number and proportion of CMV-positive droplets within each sample. Positive droplets were defined as those detectable above the set threshold (Fig.&#160;When the results were assessed in relation to donor age it was clear that the proportion of donors in whom CMV was detectable increased markedly with age. Specifically, CMV was detected in 9 of 37 (24&#160;%) of donors aged below 70&#160;years whereas a positive test was seen in each of the 7 donors above this age (Fig.&#160;The absolute quantification of CMV viral load in relation to monocyte number was then determined by QuantaSoft&#174; software in order to generate a value of &#8216;viral load per 10,000 monocytes&#8217;. In those donors in whom CMV was detectable by ddPCR, the absolute viral load varied markedly from 3 copies per 10,000 monocytes to 353 copies per 10,000 monocytes, a range of 117 fold. This value was also found to increase with age, again with a marked increase observed in donors aged over 70&#160;years (kruskal-wallis We next used a second method in order to confirm the observation of an increase in CMV load within monocytes in relation to age. Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) was applied to the same sample cohort using an average plasmid series dilution, which produced an RWe then used Q-PCR to assess CMV load within the 44 samples of monocyte DNA from healthy donors. Thirteen of the 16 samples that were found to be positive by digital PCR were also detected as positive by Q-PCR (81&#160;%). Twenty-seven out of the 28 samples that were negative by ddPCR were also negative by Q-PCR and only one was reported positive by Q-PCR. The correlation between the two techniques using 13 results that were positive by both methods had a co-efficient of determination of RIn order to determine the distribution of CMV load within different cells of the myeloid lineage we then went on to perform ddPCR on purified CD34+ haemopoietic stem cells and individual monocyte subsets. CD14 and CD16 expression can be used to subdivide the major subpopulations of monocytes into CD14&#8201;+&#8201;CD16-, CD14&#8201;+&#8201;CD16+ and CD14-CD16+ subsets (Fig.&#160;Our previous data showed an increase in CMV load within the peripheral blood during healthy ageing, so we next went on to determine the magnitude of the CMV-specific immune response in association with age. In particular, we assessed if the increase in viral load might result from a reduction in the magnitude of virus-specific immunity or if the immune response might actually increase as a response to the increased level of virus in the blood. We therefore determined the CMV-specific IgG titre using a quantitative ELISA assay against viral lysate. Interestingly, antibody titre increased substantially during ageing with a three fold increase in titre between the ages of 20 and 80&#160;years (mean titre 65.1 in donors aged 20&#160;years compared to 232 in those aged over 70); r&#8201;=&#8201;0.473; We next went on to assess the magnitude of the T cell immune response against CMV within the study cohort. Specifically, we focused on the cellular responses to pp65 and immediate early 1 (IE-1), which are two of the most immunodominant components of the CMV proteome. Several previous studies have reported the substantial magnitude of the CMV-specific T cell immune response within peripheral blood and have also identified that this can increase further with age [T cells were stimulated with peptide pools containing immunodominant epitopes from either pp65 or IE-1 and the IFN-&#947; release by peptide-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells was then determined by flow cytometry (Fig.&#160;In contrast to pp65, the frequency of CD8+ T cells recognizing IE-1 initially increased with age, but then peaked in people aged 50&#8211;60&#160;years and actually decreased in older donors (median 0.01&#160;% &lt;50&#160;years; 0.7&#160;% 50&#8211;60&#160;years and 0.1&#160;% &gt;70&#160;years old; RIn summary, the magnitude of the cellular immune response to the structural late protein pp65 increased with age, whilst the CD8+ T cell response to IE-1 peaked at the age of 50&#8211;60&#160;years and reduced thereafter.</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">Cytomegalovirus infection has been associated with a variety of health problems in elderly people and there is increasing interest in the mechanisms that underlie this association. A key determinant in this regard will be greater understanding of the balance of the viral load and the host immune response during healthy ageing. In this study we report, for the first time, that the level of cytomegalovirus viral load within the blood increased markedly in elderly people.A novel feature of our work was the use of digital droplet PCR to provide an accurate quantitative measure of latent viral DNA. Previous methods for detection of CMV from monocytic DNA generally relied on nested PCR techniques, which made quantification challenging and also raised substantial problems with reproducibility [Our work was performed using DNA isolated from monocytes, which are established as the most important haemopoietic site of viral latency [The frequency of viral detection increased markedly with each decade above the age of 50&#160;years to 37.5 and 50&#160;% and finally became positive in every donor who was older than 70. Interestingly the amount of viral DNA detected within the blood also increased substantially with age with a 29 fold increase observed between donors aged less than 70 and those over this age. The use of nested PCR also detected viral DNA within the majority of healthy elderly donors [We were also interested to use the sensitivity of ddPCR to examine the presence of CMV within specific subsets of the myelo-monocytic lineage. CD14 and CD16 can be used to delineate three major subclasses of monocyte [We were also interested to compare levels of CMV load within haemopoietic precursors of the terminally differentiated monocytic lineage. As such we isolated CD34+ haemopoietic stem cells from G-CSF mobilized blood donations. CMV was detected in 3 of these 5 samples, which is comparable to a previous report of 8 positive samples out of 12 using an alternative PCR methodology [Importantly, the ddPCR assay detects the level of viral DNA but does not assess the level of infectious virion. CMV was not detected by ddPCR within plasma samples taken from donors identified to have a positive monocyte viral load (n&#8201;=&#8201;10). This indicated that viral DNA was retained within cells, with no evidence of production of extracellular virus (data not shown).The direct measurement of viral DNA is a critical component in efforts to understand the balance of viral load and host immune response during natural CMV infection, an ambition that has been achieved so effectively for the study of HIV using RNA load. However, it is also important to correlate these values with assessment of the immune response to the virus.Figure&#160;Studies have shown that the T cell immune response to CMV increases markedly with age such that the virus-specific CD8+ T cell response can come to dominate the CD8+ T cell repertoire in some donors [Our work also observed an expansion of pp65-specific T cells in relation to ageing, with an 8.4 fold increase between the youngest and most elderly donors and may reflect an incremental accumulation to recurrent subclinical episodes of viral reactivation. However, assessment of the T cell recognition of peptides derived from the immediate early protein IE-1 revealed an increase in middle aged individuals, with reduced recognition in those of an advanced age. This observation supports previous work, which has reported no significant increase in the IE-1 specific immune response with ageing [It is currently unclear why IE-1 responses appear to wane with age. An important factor may relate to the frequency of T cell exposure to IE-derived epitopes, as these are presented to T cells repeatedly during the early period of viral replication and serve to elicit a cellular immune response that can prevent the late stages of viral infection before late viral proteins such as pp65 are produced. As such IE-1-specific T cells are exposed to very high levels of antigen stimulation and may be more susceptible to functional exhaustion than those directed against late-stage viral proteins such as pp65 [The concept that ageing leads to an alteration in the balance between viral load and the host immune response during chronic viral infection is supported by a variety of clinical and immunological observations. Herpes zoster, which represents reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV), is more common in the elderly and VZV titres increase with age, a pattern also reported for Epstein Barr Virus [</chapter><chapter title="Conclusion">In conclusion, these data reveal the delicate balance that has evolved between chronic CMV infection and the host immune response and indicate that this symbiosis can break down during ageing, where an increase in CMV viral load occurs as the attritional effects of chronic surveillance and the impact of immune senescence become more apparent. It is likely that increased understanding of the clinical importance of chronic viral infection on human health will become an important health consideration in future years.</chapter><chapter title="Methods">Forty-four CMV positive healthy donors (confirmed by CMV ELISA) were recruited for study between the ages of 25 and 86 (mean 50.5). Healthy individuals below the age of 65 were recruited from The University of Birmingham, whilst those over 65 were recruited as part of the ongoing Birmingham 1000 elder&#8217;s cohort which recruits elderly healthy donors from the local community. Following a 50&#160;ml blood donation, plasma and PBMCs were extracted over a ficoll density gradient and stored at &#8722;160&#160;&#176;C. PBMCs were used for functional T cell studies and monocyte extraction whilst plasma was used for CMV ELISA testing.Five peripheral blood stem cell donors who had received G-CSF mobilization were also recruited and aliquots of PBMC stored at &#8722;160&#160;&#176;C prior to defrosting and extraction of myeloid cell subsets.Enrichment of CD14, CD16, CD34 and dual positive CD14/16 cells from stem cell donations were sorted by flow cytomety (MoFLow sorter, BDBiosciences, Oxford, UK). Following defrosting, cells were washed in PBS and labeled for 15&#160;min at 4&#176; with LIVE/DEAD Fixable red dead cell stain kit (Life technologies, UK), PE anti-CD34 (BDBiosciences), anti-CD56 FITC (BDBiosciences), anti-CD14 FITC (BDBiosciences) and anti-CD16 Pe-Cy7 (Biolegend, San Diego, USA), prior to a further wash and sorting. For extraction of CD14 positive cells from healthy donor PBMC, positive selection using CD14 magnetically labeled beads was used and an average enrichment found to be 98.73&#160;% (SD 0.39) by flow cytometry (Miltenyi Biotec, Surrey, UK). DNA extraction was then performed on the enriched cell populations according to the protocol for GenElute Mammalian Genomic DNA miniprep kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO USA) and DNA concentration and purity checked using the Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).Human CMV HHV5 kit for Q-PCR amplification of glycoprotein B was purchased and used for all CMV PCR reactions within this work (PrimerDesign, Southampton, UK). Using the provided plasmid control, reconstituted aliquots were stored at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. Plasmid dilutions were then prepared fresh for Q-PCR to validate detection of the ddPCR assay and were diluted to produce the following copies per reaction: 50000, 10000, 2500, 500, 250, 100, 50, 10, 5 and 1.Using the QX100 droplet digital PCR system (Bio-rad, Pleasanton, CA), a reaction mixture consisting of 5ul of either CD14 positive DNA (10&#160;ng/ul) or plasmid standard made up to a volume of 8ul with PCR grade water, 10ul of 2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;ddPCR supermix for probes (Bio-rad), 1ul of reconstituted FAM labeled CMV primer and probe (Primer Design) and 1ul of HEX labeled RPP30 copy number assay for ddPCR (Bio-Rad) were loaded into a disposable plastic cartridge for droplet generation (Bio-Rad). Seventy microlitre of droplet generation oil (Bio-Rad) was also added before loading the cartridge into the droplet generator (Bio-Rad). After droplet generation, the sample was loaded into a 96 well PCR plate (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and PCR amplification carried out using the T100 thermocycler (Bio-Rad). PCR conditions consisted of 10&#160;min at 95&#160;&#176;C, prior to 40&#160;cycles at 94&#160;&#176;C for 30&#160;s and 60&#160;s at 60&#160;&#176;C and a finally 1&#160;cycle at 10&#160;min at 98&#160;&#176;C, ending at 12&#160;&#176;C. After amplification the plate was loaded onto the droplet reader (Bio-rad) and results analysed by QuantaSoft&#174; software (Bio-Rad) to give the number of virus copies per ul of PCR reaction. A positive and negative control was used in each experiment, which also verified the consistency of droplet amplitude, and a well consisting solely of water was also included. Results were obtained in triplicate. As each mammalian cell contains 2 copies of RPP30, the absolute quantification of RPP30 was divided by two in order to determine the actual cell number. The CMV viral load was then divided by this figure to obtain the CMV load per cell.Using the 7500 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, California, USA), a PCR reaction mixture consisting of 5ul of standard plasmid or 5ul of CD14 positive DNA (10&#160;ng/ul) made up to a volume of 9ul with PCR grade water, together with 10ul of 2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;Taqman Universal mastermix II with no UNG (Applied Biosystems) and 1ul of FAM labeled CMV primer and probe were loaded into a 96 well PCR plate (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). PCR amplification consisted of 2&#160;min at 95&#160;&#176;C, prior to 50&#160;cycles at 95&#160;&#176;C for 10&#160;s and 60&#160;s at 60&#160;&#176;C. A positive and negative control plus water well were included in each experiment and the standard curve repeated in triplicate and averaged.

From a population genetics perspective, we may expect the opposite: that small captive populations and lower NWhen did these changes occur? Our results suggest that these changes towards a domesticated phenotype likely began very early on based on available standing genetic variation of the progenitor population. While heterozygosity in each contemporary isofemale lab strain is virtually zero (data not shown), as a whole, these five lab strains collectively only harbor a two-fold genome-wide decrease in nucleotide diversity, &#920;The importance of ancestral standing genetic variation can also be seen in the 17,250 lab-specific SNPs. In theory, these SNPs represent any of the following: i) Inadvertent human habituation and unintentional conditioning may be the primary selective agent for such known differences among lab strains as faster development and reproductive time [While an excess of long extended haplotypes on high frequency lab-specific SNPs support an adaptive shift towards domesticated phenotypes, a relaxation of selection on certain loci involved in behavior may have co-occurred in the lab. Conditions in the laboratory are often optimized for growth and reproduction, reducing the natural ability of flies to escape predators or compete for food and mates. Thus, a relaxation of selection on activity levels, aggressiveness, and responsiveness, critical in the wild, may also drive the behavioral differences that converged across lab strains. Characters involved in mating, driven by the sparsity of mates in the vicinity, is a key difference between domestic and wild species [The use of inbred laboratory strains of Our results suggest a central role for neurogenetic genes in domestication.

Our results challenge the traditional notion that relatively submissive laboratory animals are solely the product of cumulating deleterious mutations and demonstrate how unconscious selection for human-favored traits plays an important role in driving rapid phenotypic change in the lab. Selection on a large pool of available genetic variation during the early stages of fly domestication, followed by strong and recurrent inbreeding, allow for the successive roles of adaptation and drift in shaping the genetic architecture of domesticated phenotypic traits in a bottle. Our study finds that the genes and phenotypes in fruit fly domestication are enriched in, respectively, neurogenetic and behavioral function, providing a starting point to decode the genomic basis of domestication&#160;and promoting its study in genetic model systems such as Drosophila. A detailed mapping of these genes and their SNPs to specific behaviors will not only be informative about the selective pressures that we have inadvertently applied to our immediate biotic environment, but may also provide new general insight on the divergence and isolation of populations.</chapter><chapter title="Methods">Locomotory assays were performed separately on five lines of adult Assays are conducted during active afternoon periods across successive days.

Matched sampling was used to recruit the study participants (mean-age 47 (28&#8211;63) years; 57&#160;% females). Half of the participants were the adult offspring of patients (only one parent) who had a knee replacement performed for idiopathic knee OA at any Hobart hospital from 1996 to 2000 [All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000.

BMI and osteophytes independently predicted an increase in meniscal tears over 8&#160;years. Change in meniscal tears was independently associated with an increase in knee pain severity, with offspring showing a greater increase in the severity of pain per unit change in meniscal tears compared to the control group.

A limitation of our study is a significant loss to follow up. Loss to follow-up can be a potential source of bias, however re-analysis of the data using inverse probability weighting did not change any of the results, indicating robust results. This cohort also has a wide age range (28&#8211;63 years old) as the inclusion criteria did not specify any specific age range. However all the results described in this study were adjusted for age. Another limitation was the absence of radiographs at visit-2 of the study, as we did not anticipate any major changes on radiographs due to young mean-age of the cohort with a low osteoarthritis disease burden and a short follow-up period of 2&#160;years. Furthermore, we did not analyse different types of simple tears (longitudinal, oblique, radial or horizontal) separately due to a low number of individual lesions and hence insufficient power for analysis.</chapter><chapter title="Conclusion">Change in meniscal tears shares common risk factors with knee OA and is independently associated with worsening knee pain and structural damage suggesting that meniscal tears are on the knee OA causal pathway.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700612"><title>Erratum To: Virtual house calls for Parkinson disease (Connect.Parkinson): study protocol for a randomized, controlled trial</title><article-type>correction</article-type><journal-title>Trials</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Meredith A.</first-name><last-name>Achey</last-name></author><author><first-name>Christopher A.</first-name><last-name>Beck</last-name></author><author><first-name>Denise B.</first-name><last-name>Beran</last-name></author><author><first-name>Cynthia M.</first-name><last-name>Boyd</last-name></author><author><first-name>Peter N.</first-name><last-name>Schmidt</last-name></author><author><first-name>Allison W.</first-name><last-name>Willis</last-name></author><author><first-name>Sara S.</first-name><last-name>Riggare</last-name></author><author><first-name>Richard B.</first-name><last-name>Simone</last-name></author><author><first-name>Kevin M.</first-name><last-name>Biglan</last-name></author><author><first-name>E.

The muscle-related QTL sets included in The amount of fat deposited during growth can be lowered either by reducing the number of adipocytes or reducing the size of individual fat cells. Two of the included QTL sets were associated with fat traits: white adipocyte size trait, and white adipose amount. In Duroc boars, LMP seemed to be less impacted by the number of adipose cells than by their size (adipocyte quantity; Three QTLs included in Linkage between LMP and the immune response could occur through several possible mechanisms. Strong activation of the immune system requires energy, and could divert resources that would otherwise be used for growth. High immune system activation can also lead to low protein:lipid ratios [Several of the significant QTL sets were related to body conformation&#8212;namely, cannon bone circumference, head mass, testes mass, total foot mass, outer ear area, nipple quantity, vertebra quantity, and thoracic vertebra quantity. These body conformation traits might be indicators of the balance between lean meat and fat in the carcass composition, which is a major determinant of production traits in pigs [</chapter><chapter title="Conclusions">Our present simulation studies demonstrated that the GFBLUP model could have greater predictive ability than the standard GBLUP, provided that enough causal variants were included in the genomic feature to explain &gt;10&#160;% of the genomic variance, and that dilution by non-causal markers was minimal. Addition of results from literature clearly increased predictive ability. In the observed data set, we could increase predictive ability by including QTL-related data obtained outside of the training data set, but only for the trait with the highest heritability.</chapter><chapter title="Methods">Phenotypes for three traits were available from 34,425 pure-bred Duroc boars that were part of the Danish pig-breeding system. All boar testing was conducted at the national test station B&#248;gildgaard (Pig Research Centre, Danish Agriculture and Food Council, Denmark). The phenotypic records included average daily gain (ADG; g/day) from 30&#160;kg&#8211;100&#160;kg body weight, feed efficiency (FE; feed units/kg gain), and lean meat percentage (LMP). At the end of the test period, all boars were weighed and back-fat was measured by ultrasound and used to predict LMP. The pedigree was traced back to 1984, consisted of 419,961 animals, and included 256 unknown parents (base animals).Genotypes were obtained for 3,085 of the phenotyped animals using either Illumina&#8217;s Porcine SNP60 BeadChip or Illumina&#8217;s 8.5&#160;K GGP-Porcine Low Density Bead SNP chip. Genotypes of animals genotyped with the 8.5&#160;K SNP chip were imputed to the SNP60 chip as described by [The phenotypes used in the genomic model analyses were derived from phenotypic records of growth traits adjusted for relevant environmental factors using the following linear mixed model:where We performed analyses using two different genomic models: GBLUP and GFBLUP using prior information on genomic features. These models were compared based on their predictive abilities, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genomic effects, and the precision of the estimated genomic parameters. Analyses utilized both observed and simulated phenotypic data.The GFBLUP model was based on a linear mixed model including two random genomic effects:where The GBLUP model was based on a linear mixed model including only one random genomic effect:where The additive genomic relationship matrix The variance components The predictive abilities of the models were assessed using bootstrap validations. The training population included 1,814 of the animals born in 1998&#8211;2010 and for which we had both phenotypes and genotypes. To ensure a gap of at least one generation from the training population, the validation population comprised 1,271 genotyped boars that were born between 2012 and 2014. We evaluated the models&#8217; predictive abilities by calculating the correlation between the observed phenotype To identify phenotype-associated genomic features, we used a GBLUP-derived procedure for evaluating the collective action of a set of genetic markers. This approach is based on computing a summary statistic for the set of genetic markers that measures the degree of association between the genetic feature and the phenotypes. This summary statistics can be computed several ways using single-marker effects and test statistics.The single-marker effects The variance of the single-marker effects can be calculated with the following equation:In this expression, A test statistic for a single genetic marker effect is computed as follows:where For each genomic feature, we constructed an appropriate summary statistic that measured the degree of association between the marker set and the phenotypes. We considered two different summary statistics. The first summary statistic was based on counting the genetic markers in the feature that were associated with the trait phenotype, as follows:where mwhere tA genomic feature was considered significant if the associated summary statistics were more extreme than the cut-off set based on an empirical distribution of random marker sets of same size as the genomic feature. This was tested using a competitive null hypothesis, i.eSeveral strategies were used to define genetic marker sets that formed different classes of genomic features used in GBLUP and GFBLUP model analyses.First, genomic features were derived from single-marker association test statistics (single-marker sets). A standard Second, including or excluding SNPs from a genomic feature based on single-marker association tests can result in over-fitting of the data [Third, to assess the benefit of including prior data in GFBLUP models, we derived genomic features from the summary statistics of a group of genetic markers defined by a previously identified QTL region (a QTL set). The QTLs recorded in the Pig QTL database [We also established a series of simulation studies to investigate factors influencing the power to detect genomic features affecting the trait phenotype, estimation of genomic parameters, and prediction ability of the two tested linear mixed models. We used the method described in [The simulations were based on the real genotype data set including 3,085 individuals and 33,029 SNPs. In all scenarios, the number of causal SNPs was equal to 1,000. Causal sets were divided into two subsets. The first subset Phenotypes were simulated using the following linear model: The present study was not subject to ethical approval since it was based on pre-existing data belonging to the Danish Agriculture and Food Council, Pig Research Centre, and did not require the application of additional experimental procedures. The simulated data is available upon request.The genotypic and phenotypic data on the Danish Duroc population used in this study is private property of the Danish pig breeders and the authors are not at liberty to disclose them in the public domain.

This group of viral proteins is collectively referred to as viroporins [All viroporins share structural motifs, such as hydrophobic domains that form an amphipathic &#945;-helix, and a cluster of basic residues, which can interact with negatively charged lipids [Viroporins have been identified in several RNA viruses including In the present study, we observed by in silico analysis that the NS2B has a highly hydrophobic profile, similar to that previously reported for the JEV NS2B protein. Furthermore, comparative analysis between the DENV and JEV NS2B sequences revealed striking similarities. We also observed that the overexpression of recombinant NS2B in bacteria affected bacteria cell growth and enhanced bacterial membrane permeability to hygromycin B (HygB). In addition, crosslinking tests showed the ability to form oligomers; when recombinant NS2B was incubated with erythrocyte membrane systems, it produced organized structures within the membranes, which promoted the destabilization of the erythrocyte membrane and cell lysis. Therefore, this study represents the first investigation into the potential role of NS2B in causing changes in membrane permeability during DENV infection.</chapter><chapter title="Results">Results from a previous study demonstrated that the NS2B protein from JEV could modify membrane permeability in different systems [To obtain sufficient recombinant DENV NS2B protein for analyzing its membrane-altering activity, we cloned and expressed the NS2B protein with an N-terminus V5 epitope and a 6&#215; His tag to facilitate its purification (Fig.&#160;To demonstrate that the NS2B protein was associated with bacterial membranes, additional experiments were performed. We isolated membranes and then extracted the membrane proteins using TDPC detergent to study proteins contained in membrane fractions from inclusion bodies. The transformed bacteria were grown as described previously.Next, a western blot was performed using an anti-V5 antibody to detect the NS2B protein (Fig.&#160;A conserved characteristic of viroporins is the presence of hydrophobic domains that interact with lipid membranes. Another property shared by viroporins is their ability to oligomerize once inserted into cell membranes. Previous reports demonstrated that several viroporins could oligomerize in the presence of glutaraldehyde [The above results showed that NS2B formed at least trimeric structures that induced hemolytic activity. Base on this finding, we analyzed the presence of the NS2B protein in erythrocyte ghost membranes by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This analysis revealed the presence of ring-shaped structures, the number of which was dependent on the NS2B concentration used (Fig.&#160;</chapter><chapter title="Discussion">Numerous studies using different positive-strand RNA viruses have demonstrated that reorganization of the intracellular membrane can create a scaffold for the replication machinery of different viruses [One of more distinctive characteristics of viroporins is their ability of induce changes in membrane permeability. In this study, we provide the first evidence that pore-forming activity occurs when the NS2B protein is expressed in a bacterial system, as widely shown with other viral proteins with viroporin activity [Another important feature of viroporins is that they can oligomerize; therefore, great efforts have been taken to understand the architecture of these proteins [This work provides the first direct evidence that the NS2B protein is capable of oligomerizing, producing pore-like structures in different environments, and modifying the permeability of the membrane. Future studies are necessary to assess whether the effect of the protein NS2B in these model membranes occur in the context of infection with DENV. However, it is important to mention that the protein NS2B, similar to other small hydrophobic viral proteins, is actively transported to vesicles where replication complexes are formed. The presence of pores in these vesicles has been reported [</chapter><chapter title="Conclusions">This study demonstrated the ability of the NS2B protein to function as a viroporin. Our results showed that the NS2B protein can alter the permeability of different models of membranes and that organized structures were observed in ghost erythrocyte membranes. These results suggested that NS2B potentially has MDA, a function that could be critical for steps during the DENV replication cycle.</chapter><chapter title="Methods">The stock preparation and titration of DENV-2 New Guinea strain AF0136 were performed as described previously [The DENV-2 NS2B gene was cloned in the plasmid pET151/D-TOPO (Invitrogen). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from DENV-2-infected C6/36 cells using the Trizol reagent (Gibco, USA), according to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. The NS2B sequence from DENV-2 (New Guinea) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR, using the primer pair: 5&#8242;-ctaggatccatgagctggccacta-3&#8242; (forward) and 5&#8242;-ccggaattctcaccgttgtttcttcac-3&#8242; (reverse). The PCR product was ligated into the pET151/D-TOPO cloning vector in frame with cDNA encoding a V5 epitope and a 6&#215; His tag (V5H6NS2B). Finally, the plasmid from the resultant colonies was purified the next day using an EndoFree Plasmid Purification Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Construction was verified by automated DNA sequencing.Bacterial cultures were transformed with V5H6NS2B, and the NS2B protein was induced for 24&#160;h by the addition of IPTG. The bacterial lysates were then sonicated, centrifuged, and resuspended in 50&#160;mM Tris and 10&#160;mM EDTA. These steps were performed to pellet the inclusion bodies containing the NS2B protein, which were then analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining and western blotting with a monoclonal antibody against the V5 epitope (Invitrogen). The V5H6NS2B protein was purified by 2 methods. First, inclusion bodies were resolved by electrophoresis on a 17&#160;% SDS-PAGE gel, and the V5H6NS2B protein was eluted from an excised gel piece in 1&#160;% PBS overnight at 4&#160;&#176;C. The V5H6NS2B protein was further purified using the ProBond Purification System (Invitrogen). Briefly, nickel-coupled resin was resuspended in native-binding buffer (250&#160;mM NaHSeven micrograms of purified V5H6NS2B protein in HEPES buffer was incubated with increasing concentration (0.1&#8211;0.5&#160;%) of glutaraldehyde (Sigma). These reactions were incubated in the dark for 2&#160;min at 25&#160;&#176;C and subsequently quenched with 50&#160;mM Tris&#8211;HCl, pH&#160;8.0 for 15&#8211;20&#160;min. Cross-linked proteins was separated on a 12&#160;% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions, and complexes were detected in western blots with a polyclonal anti-NS2B antibody and a secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase.The hemolytic property of the V5H6NS2B protein was measured in human erythrocytes. Hemolysis assays were performed as described previously [To determine the organization of the V5H6NS2B protein in biological membranes, erythrocyte ghosts were prepared from blood cells. Red cells were purified from blood samples in the presence of anticoagulant and by centrifugation at 1500&#160;rpm for 10&#160;min, and the plasma was removed by aspiration. This procedure was performed 3 times, using 0.17&#160;M NaCl buffer to re-suspend cells following each centrifugation step. After the third centrifugation step, the pelleted cells were resuspended in 0.17&#160;M NaCl buffer to the original sample volume.

Upon admission and clinical examination, the eligibility of the patients enrolled in the study was established as follows: HIV/AIDS men and women at any WHO stages of the disease, under antiretroviral (ART) treatment or not, without psychiatric illness, not diabetic, without long term physical disability, and inability to eat. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Ministry of Health of Senegal and registered with the National Institutes of Health as a clinical trial number NCT02433743. Prior to participation, the patients were informed about the study objectives and procedures, and their written consent was obtained.The study was designed as a randomized, controlled trial with one treatment group and a Control group. Eligible sixty-five (65) HIV- infected adults hospitalized in the SMI were randomly allocated to receive either standard hospital diet (Control group: During hospitalization, the Control group received a standard hospital diet that consisted of three local meals/d (breakfast, lunch and dinner). The meals were provided either by the hospital or by the patient&#8217;s relatives. The RUTF group received daily, in addition to the standard hospital diet, 200&#160;g of supplement (100&#160;g RUTF mixed with 100&#160;g of rice porridge). The rice porridge (9.1&#160;g rice flour per 100&#160;ml water) was prepared extemporaneously, mixed with the RUTF, and served immediately. RUTF is composed of peanut butter and skimmed milk powder fortified with a vitamin-mineral complex commercialized by Nutriset. Our laboratory tested RUTF for the first time during the rehabilitation of children suffering from severe and acute malnutrition [The nutrient composition of the supplement and percentage coverage of nutrient requirements relative to RDA are shown in Table&#160;Dietary intakes were measured during 7 consecutive days in 10 randomly selected subjects from each group during the hospitalization period. Individual ration of each meal served by the hospital or provided by the relatives was weighed with a food scale (i-Balance 2600 Myweigh, Scale Company, Phoenix, USA). At the end of the meal, the remains (R) were weighed. Thus, the difference between the amount served and the remaining amount was used to calculate the exact amount of food consumed by the patient. Nutrient intakes were calculated using the African food composition tables [Anthropometric measurements were performed using standard procedures. Measure of height was made using height board (SECA 216, GmbH et Co, Hamburg, Germany), to the nearest millimeter. Body weight was measured with an electronic scale (SECA 877, GmbH &amp; Co, Hamburg, Germany), with a maximal range of 200&#160;kg and a precision of 100&#160;g. The measures were made in duplicate without clothing.Body composition was measured using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) with a multifrequency analyser (Xitron 4000B, Xitron Technologies, California, USA). The accuracy of the instrument was tested before the measurements by using a 422&#937; standard resistor purchased with the analyzer.

A high prevalence of severe chronic malnutrition was detected among the Senegalese PLWH, and according to several authors [The daily recommended intake of vitamin A in our patients was covered by consumption of a vegetable-based soup prepared by the hospital and rich in beta-carotene. But we did not investigated the others nutrients in the soup. The home diet of the patients was not measured but it is expected the vitamin A stores gained during hospitalization remains for several weeks.This was not the case for iron. During hospitalization, iron intake from the patients&#8217; diet was very low as well as the iron content of 100&#160;g RUTF. Although the supplementation increased a bit the iron intake of the RUTF group, it did not reach the daily recommended intake, and all the positive effects on the hemoglobin level in this group cannot be assigned to iron intake. In a previous study from our laboratory (unpublished data), we showed that Senegalese outpatients PLWH with anemia were not iron deficient according to their plasma ferritin concentration or serum transferrin receptor. In the present study, the prevalence of anemia was and remained high after 9&#160;weeks follow-up in both groups, and these results are similar to those reported by others [At the end of the hospitalization period, any beneficial effect of the supplementation was observed on body composition but after 9&#160;weeks home supplementation, the change in body composition was highly significant from baseline (+11&#160;% body mass). The increase in fat free mass in the RUTF group could be explained by the increase coverage of certain nutrients, particularly vitamins and minerals. It could also result from the reduction of opportunistic infections during hospitalization. Infectious episodes are accompanied by increase protein catabolism which partially explains the high rate of severe malnutrition observed in our patients in both groups, and their low initial fat free mass. Also, multivitamins could directly avert muscle loss by decreasing the oxidative stress that has been found to result in muscle wasting [The prevalence of zinc deficiency was high (50&#160;%) in both groups although the supplement had covered the zinc requirements in the RUTF group. High prevalence of zinc deficiency in PLWH has been reported by other authors [</chapter><chapter title="Conclusion">Severe chronic malnutrition is highly prevalent among Senegalese hospitalized PLWH with a significant loss of fat free mass. The patient&#8217;s usual diet did not cover most of the nutrient requirements, including energy. Improving this diet with a supplement consisting of 100&#160;g RUTF (a high energy dense fortified food) mixed in rice allowed to cover the RDA of many micronutrients including zinc for PLWH. The supplement had a positive effect on body composition by increasing the amount of lean and fat mass and maintaining % body fat. Within the supplemented group, food&#8201;+&#8201;treatment were better at restoring fat free mass and resolving anemia than treatment alone. The anemic status of the patients was also significantly improved despite a low iron intake. It is possible that the supplement has improved the zinc status of the PLWH (fat free mass deposit increased), but we were unable to confirm such improvement as their plasma zinc concentration failed to reflect it. Research is needed to identify more sensitive indicator of zinc status in PLWH in response to zinc fortification. However, from the overall results, this study, we would like to recommend supplementation of adult PLWH with 100&#160;g RUTF in the early stage of the infection.</chapter></chapters></article><article id="oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:4700616"><title>Emergence of multi-acaricide resistant </title><article-type>research-article</article-type><journal-title>Parasites &amp; Vectors</journal-title><authors><author><first-name>Patrick</first-name><last-name>Vudriko</last-name></author><author><first-name>James</first-name><last-name>Okwee-Acai</last-name></author><author><first-name>Dickson Stuart</first-name><last-name>Tayebwa</last-name></author><author><first-name>Joseph</first-name><last-name>Byaruhanga</last-name></author><author><first-name>Steven</first-name><last-name>Kakooza</last-name></author><author><first-name>Edward</first-name><last-name>Wampande</last-name></author><author><first-name>Robert</first-name><last-name>Omara</last-name></author><author><first-name>Jeanne Bukeka</first-name><last-name>Muhindo</last-name></author><author><first-name>Robert</first-name><last-name>Tweyongyere</last-name></author><author><first-name>David Okello</first-name><last-name>Owiny</last-name></author><author><first-name>Takeshi</first-name><last-name>Hatta</last-name></author><author><first-name>Naotoshi</first-name><last-name>Tsuji</last-name></author><author><first-name>Rika</first-name><last-name>Umemiya-Shirafuji</last-name></author><author><first-name>Xuenan</first-name><last-name>Xuan</last-name></author><author><first-name>Masaharu</first-name><last-name>Kanameda</last-name></author><author><first-name>Kozo</first-name><last-name>Fujisaki</last-name></author><author><first-name>Hiroshi</first-name><last-name>Suzuki</last-name></author></authors><article-categories><category>Research</category></article-categories><chapters><chapter title="Background">Ticks are one of the leading vectors of diseases of economic importance to the livestock industry in Africa [</chapter><chapter title="Methods">The primary study area for this research were cattle farms in western and central Uganda that were experiencing acaricide failure between December 2013 and January 2015. Western and central Uganda have the highest population of exotic cattle (especially dairy breeds) and their crosses [Ticks were collected from 6 to 20 randomly sampled cattle per farm although dogs were also included for tick collection in farms that had dogs. Ticks were collected from goats and sheep on one farm in Kampala. Cattle, goats and sheep were restrained and inspected for ticks in the various predilection sites. Dogs on the other hand were restrained by the owner before tick samples were picked. Both engorged and semi-engorged ticks from each farm were carefully picked and put in perforated labelled sample bottles and transported to the Central Diagnostic laboratory (CDL) at the College of Veterinary Medicine, Animal Resources and Biosecurity (COVAB), Makerere University for taxonomic identification, hatching and acaricide efficacy assays.Ticks were identified to species level based on morphological features described by Walker Commercial acaricide formulations that represented all the classes of acaricide on Ugandan market were purchased from the local importers and used for LPT. They were coded as; A4 (12.5&#160;% amitraz, Kenya), SP3 (10&#160;%, &#945;-cypermethrin, Kenya), SP10 (5&#160;%, deltamethrin, Tunisia), OP (100&#160;%, chlorfenvinphos, Italy), COF1 (co-formulation, 30&#160;% chlorfenvinphos and 3&#160;% &#945;-cypermethrin, Italy). The commercial (brand) names of the acaricides used were coded for anonymity to avoid any misinterpretation as promotion or demotion of such products based on their efficacy result.A total of 31 tick populations from 30 farms were tested for acaricide susceptibility. For logistical reasons, we adopted the method proposed for insecticide resistance testing by World Health Organization (WHO) [The choice of substrate used for impregnation of the chemicals was based on Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [After 24&#160;hours, the packets were removed in the order in which they were loaded in the incubator. Three independent enumerators who were previously trained on identifying dead and live ticks using a magnifying lens and stereo-microscope counted the number of ticks that died and those that were alive for each set of experiments. Mortalities were expressed as percentage of the total number of larvae exposed to the acaricide. There were no mortalities recorded in the control groups that were exposed to only the diluent.A semi-structured interview with farmers and/or farm workers was carried out from 52 of the 54 farms since data could not be retrieved from the two farms. The data captured included breeds of cattle reared, sequence of acaricide brands used in the last two years, method of acaricide application, dilution of acaricide(s) used, application interval at the time of the study and mixing of two or more acaricide formulations at one time. The data on sequence and brands of acaricides were used to determine the correctness of rotation from one molecule to another. Rotation was considered wrong if a farmer changed acaricide brand within the same molecule and changing from COF to SP following acaricide failure. However, a change from synthetic pyrethroid (SP) to co-formulation (COF) and organophosphate (OP) molecule following acaricide failure to SP was also considered a wrong rotation due to the possible cross-resistance between SP and OP [The mortality data for the 31 tick populations tested were recorded in MS excel and mean mortality and standard error determined. The WHO [The study was approved by the institutional review board (No. VAB/REC/15/104) of the College of Veterinary Medicine, Animal Resources and Biosecurity, Makerere University. To ensure biosecurity of ticks, all experiments were carried out under strict in-house procedure for avoiding escape of larvae. All materials used were either autoclaved or soaked in hot water at 99&#160;&#176;C. Larvae that were kept for further molecular studies were preserved in 70&#160;% ethanol. The commercial (brand) names of all the acaricides were coded to ensure confidentiality.</chapter><chapter title="Results">Of the 54 cattle farms from which ticks were collected, 83.3&#160;% (45/54) kept crosses of exotic cattle and 9/54 had only local cattle as the main livestock enterprise. Up to 90.4&#160;% (47/52) of the farms used hand spray for acaricide application while only 3.8&#160;% (2/52) used plunge dip and another 1.9&#160;% (1/52) used spray race. Complaint of acaricide failure was reported in 94.4&#160;% (51/54) of the farms that were all located in central and western Uganda. A total of 1357 ticks were identified from the 54 study farms. The veterinary drug register showed that a total of 25 commercial brands of acaricides had been marketed in Uganda. Synthetic pyrethroids (SP1-SP15) constituted 60.0&#160;% (15/25) of the total commercial brands marketed, followed by amitraz (A1-A7 brands) 28.0&#160;% (7/25), co-formulation (COF1-COF2) 8.0&#160;% (2/25) and only one brand of mono-formulated organophosphate was registered. However, 68.0&#160;% (17/25) of the commercial brands of acaricide registered were found to have been used in the study farms. Overall, amitraz accounted for 36.9&#160;% (48/130) of the total acaricide formulations used for tick control followed by COF 30.0&#160;% (39/130), SP 27.7&#160;% (36/130) and mono-formulated OP 5.4&#160;% (7/130) being the least used class of acaricide. Within the same molecule, clear brand preferences were recorded. For example two brands of amitraz (A3 and A4), four brands of SP (SP1, SP2, SP3 and SP13) and 1 brand of COF (COF1) were preferred by 75.0&#160;% (36/48), 69.4&#160;% (25/36) and 71.8&#160;% (28/39) of the farmers, respectively. The majority of the farmers (81.3&#160;%, As shown in Table&#160;The percentage mortality of larvae against the different acaricides used in the bioassay at DD and 2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;DD is shown in Table&#160;At DD, 90.0&#160;% (27/30) of the ticks tested were resistant to both cypermethrin and deltamethrin. Doubling the concentration (2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;DD) of both chemicals did not cause any significant increase in mortality of the above ticks since 86.7&#160;% (26/30) remained resistant (Fig.&#160;Mono-formulated OP (chlorfenvinphos) at DD was efficacious in 86.7&#160;% (26/30) of tick populations screened. However, 13.3&#160;% (4/30) of the one host tick At DD of co-formulation, resistance was detected in 43.3&#160;% (13/30) of the tick populations tested. Interestingly, even at 2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;DD, the co-formulated acaricide could not provide the level of effectiveness that was shown by mono-formulated chlorfenvinphos at DD since 23&#160;% (7/30) tick populations tested remained resistant (Fig.&#160;At the DD only 12.9&#160;% (4/31) of the tick populations tested had amitraz resistant The presence of single or multiple acaricide resistance in the study area is shown in Fig.&#160;To overcome acaricide failure, various coping strategies have been adopted by farmers although they were considered to potentially worsen the existing tick challenge. Buying different brand(s) of acaricide with little or no regard to similarity in active molecules with previous brand(s) used on the same farm was encountered. In two years, 74.1&#160;% (20/27) of the farms whose tick acaricide resistance status was determined used two to three acaricide molecules, and 55.6&#160;% (15/27) rotated the molecules wrongly. Rotation within the same molecule through purchase of different brands was recorded in 40.7&#160;% (11/27) of the farms. In addition, 25.9&#160;% (7/27) of the farmers increased the concentration of acaricide at least twice over the recommended strength. Some 14.8&#160;% (4/27) of the farmers shortened acaricide application interval to twice a week (every three days). This translates into approximately 10 exposures every month and 120 exposures annually. Mixing of two different acaricide formulations was encountered in 7&#160;% (2/27) of farms and one of the farms mixed co-formulation and amitraz, thus exposing ticks to all the three molecules at once. In a farm that mixed two acaricides and sprayed twice every week, damage to the skin of cattle due to frequent spraying with higher acaricide strength was encountered. As a result, the ticks were easily picked with the damaged skin (Additional file </chapter><chapter title="Discussion">This is the first report that has comprehensively investigated tick acaricide resistance since the introduction of synthetic pyrethroid, co-formulations and amitraz in Uganda. In this study, 93.5&#160;% (29/31) of the larval population tested had resistance to at least one class of acaricide molecule; all of them belonging to the genus Amitraz resistance was the least detected (12.9&#160;%) in the current study thus corroborating with the findings on in its use at farm level.

These findings will provide rapid prediction and beneficial effects on the early prevention of cardiac dysfunction after STEMI.</chapter><chapter title="Methods">This was a retrospective clinical study to review the patients of acute STEMI underwent primary PCI (Several important clinical variables were record, such as age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, stable angina history, Time to hospital (from chest pain on-set to diagnosis) and D-to-B time (door to balloon).Prior to primary PCI, all patients received adequate loading doses of aspirin (300&#160;mg) and clopidogrel (300&#160;mg) or ticagrelor (180&#160;mg) immediately after diagnosed as STEMI. Procedure of PCI was performed immediately via the femoral or radial access route. The characteristics of coronary angiography were record, such as culprit artery, acute occlusive segment and multi-vessel disease (defined as having at least another vessel with 75&#160;% or greater stenosis except the culprit occlusion artery, such as culprit vessel in LAD had LCX or RCA or LM stenosis, culprit vessel in LCX had RCA or LAD or LM stenosis, culprit vessel in RCA had LCX or LAD or LM stenosis). A lesion was considered proximal if it was located proximal to the first diagonal branch in the LAD, the first obtuse marginal branch in LCX, or the first acute marginal branch in RCA [The usages of interventional techniques, thrombus aspiration and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor were chosen at the operators&#8217; discretion. The phenomenon of no reflow or slow flow post-stenting was record. Post-PCI blood pressure, including systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), was detected by invasive blood pressure monitor from radial or femoral vascular sheaths.Echocardiography was performed before discharge (4&#8211;6 days post-PCI) in all patients using a Philips IE33 instrument (Philips, Netherlands) with a 2&#8211;3.5&#160;MHz transducer (X3-1), while left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were detected by Simpson method. It was defined as reduced LVEF while LVEF less than 55&#160;%. All exams were performed by one of three echocardiography operators. These three operators underwent standardized training before this study. Observers who detected LVEF were blinded to the results of coronary angiography and clinical record. The incidence of reduced LVEF after STEMI was compared between two different culprit artery systems, including LAD related STEMI (LM occlusion and LAD occlusion, All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software 19.0.

The details about the protocol of this multiple screening programme have been described in full elsewhere (The screening procedures consisted of registration, fasting blood drawing, anthropometric measurement, questionnaire, physical examination and health condition. The contents of the questionnaire, including demographic characteristics, family history, dietary behaviour and lifestyle, were surveyed in each screening activity. A series of biochemical variables, including haemoglobin, platelets, white blood cells and fasting glucose, were collected after blood collection.The prevalence of IBS is defined as period prevalence as IBS is rarely an acute disease and point prevalence may not be adequate. A prospective cohort study with a staggered entry design was adopted to ensure the temporal relationship between IBS and incident cases of colorectal neoplasia in our present study, and 1008 cases of colorectal adenomas and invasive carcinomas of the colon and rectum were excluded (The colorectal neoplasia cases were obtained from colonoscopy after repeated FIT screening with follow-up until the end of 2009. The symptomatic CRCs were also ascertained based on linkage with national cancer registry data until the end of 2009. Among these participants, information on IBS cases was obtained from the Bureau of National Health Insurance claim database, which covered the medical services of &#8764;95% of the entire population from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2004 (In the present study, anthropometric measurements (including blood pressure, height, weight and waist circumference), information on demographic characteristics (including age, gender and education) and lifestyle, family history and a series of biochemical variables were also collected and used at the first entry of screening. When classifying the years of education, we classified education into three levels. Six years or less of education was classified as low education level. Between 6 and 12 years of education was classified as medium education level. Twelve years of education or above was classified as high education level. Current or former smokers were placed in the smoking group. Similarly, current or former drinkers were placed in the alcoholic-drinking group. Exercise frequency was categorised into three groups (never, low and high). Exercise time less than 100&#8201;min per week was defined as the low-frequency group, whereas exercise time over 100&#8201;min per week was defined as the high-frequency group.Patients with blood pressure &#10878;140&#8201;mm&#8201;Hg/90&#8201;mm&#8201;Hg or those with a history of hypertension were placed in the hypertension group.

In contrast to the diagnosis of IBS using the Rome II questionnaire survey, we used national health insurance data to make the IBS diagnosis. As a portion of IBS patients, especially those with mild symptoms, do not seek medical help, underestimation of the prevalence of IBS is highly suspected, especially among younger people. This could explain why our study showed a lower IBS prevalence among people aged 40&#8211;49 years than what was found in the previous study.In the past, IBS was viewed as a purely functional disorder. However, in recent years, numerous data have suggested that immune activation occurs in IBS patients (In the present study, we found that IBS patients were associated with a significantly higher risk of colorectal adenoma and colon neoplasia compared with those without IBS. Three possible reasons could explain why IBS patients have a higher risk of developing colon neoplasia. First, IBS and colon neoplasia have similar clinical symptoms that result in the higher detection rate of colon neoplasia. Second, IBS and colon neoplasia share common risk factors. Third, IBS has a causal role in the pathogenesis of colon neoplasia.Two previous studies from the United Kingdom and Denmark revealed a lack of relationship between IBS and CRC after excluding CRCs within the first year of follow-up (IBS is a clinical syndrome diagnosed by clinical presentation after removal of the structural abnormality (The risk factors of IBS are still unclear; however, several have been identified by epidemiologic studies over the past few decades. However, it is difficult to separate factors promoting health-care seeking from true risk factors for the disease (</chapter><chapter title="Conclusion">Our study finds a significant association between IBS and colon neoplasia, and it provides an important suggestion to clinical physicians: they should pay more attention to IBS and the possibility of colon neoplasia or CRC in patients.</chapter></chapters></article></data>
