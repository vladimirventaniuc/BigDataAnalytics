          <title>Background:</title>
          <p>We aim to report the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and elucidate the influence of IBS on the incidence of colorectal neoplasm through a community-screening-based, longitudinal follow-up study.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods:</title>
          <p>We enroled 39 384 community residents aged 40 years or older who had participated in a community-based colorectal cancer-screening programme with an immunochemical faecal occult test since 1999. We followed a cohort that was free of colorectal neoplasm (excluding colorectal neoplasm at baseline) to ascertain the incident colorectal neoplasm through each round of screening and used a nationwide cancer registry. Information on IBS was obtained by linking this screened cohort with population-based health insurance claim data. Other confounding factors were also collected via questionnaire or biochemical tests.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results:</title>
          <p>The overall period prevalence of IBS was 23%, increasing from 14.7% for subjects aged 40–49 years to 43.7% for those aged 70 years and more. After controlling for age, gender and family history of colorectal cancer, screenees who had been diagnosed as having IBS exhibited a significantly elevated level (21% adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.21 (95% CI: 1.02–1.42)) of incident colorectal adenoma compared with those who had not been diagnosed with IBS. A similar finding was noted for invasive carcinoma; however, the size of the effect was of borderline statistical significance (adjusted HR=1.20 (95% CI: 0.94–1.53)).</p>

  <body>
    <p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent functional disorder; however, the epidemiological profile is still short of empirical data. The previous, population-based studies in Western countries have reported the prevalence of IBS in adults within a wide range between 3 and 22% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Oberndorff-Klein Woolthuis <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), in contrast to the range of 6.5–10.1% that was reported in a recent Asian study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chang <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). The established risk factors include age, gender, education, social economic status, race, drug and psychological factors. Currently, few population-based studies have investigated the relationship between biological markers and IBS from a clinical viewpoint.</p>
    <p>As IBS shares symptoms with other major gastrointestinal diseases, for example, colorectal neoplasia, it is worthwhile to evaluate the relationship between IBS and colorectal neoplasia in addition to the predisposing risk factors. Two studies from the United Kingdom and Denmark revealed a lack of relationship between IBS and colorectal cancer (CRC) after excluding CRCs within the first year of follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Garcia Rodriguez <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Nørgaard <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). However, little is known about the association of long-term IBS with the potential risk of developing colorectal neoplasia. To the best of our knowledge, few reports on the risk for colorectal neoplasia in large cohorts of IBS subjects with a long follow-up time exist. The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of IBS and to assess the risk factors associated with IBS using a population-based, integrated screening programme and to assess the risk of developing colorectal neoplasia in cohorts of subjects with IBS.</p>

        <title>Setting and study population</title>
        <p>To build a prospective cohort, we recruited 39 384 community residents aged over 40 who participated in a Keelung community-based, integrated screening programme between 1999 and 2004. The details about the protocol of this multiple screening programme have been described in full elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). To sum up, the programme was initially designed to screen five cancers (cervical, breast, oral, colorectal and liver cancer) and three chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia). For CRC screening, the immunochemical faecal occult blood test (FIT) was applied for the early detection of colorectal neoplasia. Details of the protocol and screening results have been published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). The 39 384 participants were invited to undergo CRC screening with FIT in a staggered entry with numbers of participants being 1967, 8370, 10 683, 7560, 5872 and 4932 in years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Those with positive FIT results were referred to undergo colonoscopy as the standard, confirmatory procedure for the detection of colorectal neoplasia. Note that, although the cohort for the following analysis is based on these screeness, they should be representative of the underlying population in Keelung as they were invited from the underlying population registry with such a large size. Even some selective factors may affect the uptake of CRC, but they would not affect the association between IBS and colorectal neoplasia as the participants who were invited were not aware of this study before. Moreover, the demographic features in the Keelung city are also representative of those of Taiwanese people because the incidence rates of several chronic diseases and cancers in Keelung city were close to those of Taiwanese people.</p>
        <p>The screening procedures consisted of registration, fasting blood drawing, anthropometric measurement, questionnaire, physical examination and health condition. The contents of the questionnaire, including demographic characteristics, family history, dietary behaviour and lifestyle, were surveyed in each screening activity. A series of biochemical variables, including haemoglobin, platelets, white blood cells and fasting glucose, were collected after blood collection.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Study design</title>
        <p>The prevalence of IBS is defined as period prevalence as IBS is rarely an acute disease and point prevalence may not be adequate. A prospective cohort study with a staggered entry design was adopted to ensure the temporal relationship between IBS and incident cases of colorectal neoplasia in our present study, and 1008 cases of colorectal adenomas and invasive carcinomas of the colon and rectum were excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To establish the temporal sequence that IBS occurs before CRC neoplasia, for those subjects with colorectal neoplasia, if the date of IBS diagnosis was later the confirmatory date of colorectal neoplasia, they were excluded from incident analysis.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Data collection</title>
        <p>The colorectal neoplasia cases were obtained from colonoscopy after repeated FIT screening with follow-up until the end of 2009. The symptomatic CRCs were also ascertained based on linkage with national cancer registry data until the end of 2009. Among these participants, information on IBS cases was obtained from the Bureau of National Health Insurance claim database, which covered the medical services of ∼95% of the entire population from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Wen <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). During this period, participants with at least one outpatient visit with ICD-9-codes 5640 and 5641 were identified as having IBS, and the record of the first visit, with the date of the visit, was collected for each individual. To enhance the accuracy of identifying patients with IBS, we further validated prescription data from pharmaceutical claims for each prescription of these patients that contained at least one of the drugs listed below: laxative, antidiarrhoea and antispasmotic/anticholinergic drugs.</p>
        <p>In the present study, anthropometric measurements (including blood pressure, height, weight and waist circumference), information on demographic characteristics (including age, gender and education) and lifestyle, family history and a series of biochemical variables were also collected and used at the first entry of screening. When classifying the years of education, we classified education into three levels. Six years or less of education was classified as low education level. Between 6 and 12 years of education was classified as medium education level. Twelve years of education or above was classified as high education level. Current or former smokers were placed in the smoking group. Similarly, current or former drinkers were placed in the alcoholic-drinking group. Exercise frequency was categorised into three groups (never, low and high). Exercise time less than 100 min per week was defined as the low-frequency group, whereas exercise time over 100 min per week was defined as the high-frequency group.</p>
        <p>Patients with blood pressure ⩾140 mm Hg/90 mm Hg or those with a history of hypertension were placed in the hypertension group. Patients with fasting plasma glucose ⩾126 mg dl<sup>−1</sup> or those with a history of diabetes mellitus were placed in the diabetes mellitus group. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to NCEP and was modified using the ATP III criteria with the adjustment of waist circumference for Asians. Three or more of the following five criteria must have been met to be placed in the metabolic syndrome group: (1) obesity – men ⩾90 cm and women ⩾80 cm; (2) hypertriglyceridaemia – ⩾150 mg dl<sup>−1</sup>; (3) low HDL – cholesterol concentration &lt;40 mg dl<sup>−1</sup> for men and &lt;50 mg dl<sup>−1</sup> for women; (4) high blood pressure – ⩾130 mmHg/85 mm Hg or hypertension; and (5) high fasting plasma glucose – ⩾100 mg dl<sup>−1</sup> or diabetes mellitus.</p>

        <title>Statistical analysis</title>
        <p>Continuous variables such as age and follow-up time are expressed as the mean with s.d., and categorical variables are presented as the number and proportion. Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare continuous variables. Categorical variables, such as gender and education levels, were analysed using the <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>-test. All <italic>P</italic>-values were two-tailed, and a <italic>P</italic>-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was applied to assess the relationship between IBS and the development of adenoma or CRC with adjustments for possible confounding factors. The proportional hazard assumption was tested for all the possible associations between IBS and the developing adenoma or CRC. All the results tested with proportional hazard assumption were not statistical significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.8250 for adenoma, <italic>P</italic>=0.2182 for CRC and <italic>P</italic>=0.4670 for colorectal neoplasia).</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Of the 39 384 subjects, 9160 had IBS. The prevalence of IBS was 23.3% (95% CI: 22.8–23.7%). Subjects with IBS were older than those without (60.9±12.2 <italic>vs</italic> 55.9±11.1). The difference was statistically significant. By dividing age into four groups, those with IBS in the eldest group almost the triple of that with IBS in the youngest group. Age-specific prevalence rates of IBS increased with age, ranging from 14.7% for ages 40–49 years to 43.7% for ages over 70 years. Those with diabetes had higher chance of having IBS than those without (29.8% <italic>vs</italic> 22.6%). The similar finding was observed for higher odds of having IBS in subjects with hypertension compared with those without (24.6% <italic>vs</italic> 22.5%). It is very interesting to note that those without family history, lacking the habit of smoking and alcohol drinking, and frequent exercise had higher proportion of IBS than those with the opposite group. The prevalence was 32.0% for those suffering from colorectal neoplasia and 34.5% for those suffering from CRC (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The estimated results on the associations between each factor and the risk for adenoma, CRC and colorectal neoplasia are given in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. As the sample size is sufficiently large, all the variables except BMI and family history of CRC in association with IBS would be statistically significant, even though the difference was small. These relationships were not of great interest because we are interested in how the relationship between IBS and colorectal neoplasia was affected by these variables (see below). As far as demographic features are concerned, an increase in 1 year of age led to a 5% (OR=1.05, 95%% CI: 1.04–1.06) elevated risk for CRC. Male patients were at greater risk than female patients by 53% (OR=1.53, 95%% CI: 1.22–1.91). Similar findings were also observed for the risks of adenoma and colorectal neoplasia with age and gender. The higher education levels were at lower risk than the low education levels. Lifestyle including smoking, alcohol drinking and exercise were not associated with the risk for CRC (OR=1.15, 95% CI: 0.81–1.61); however, the elevated risks for adenoma and colorectal neoplasia were noted in those who has the habbit of smoking or drinking. Obesity (BMI over 30) was positively associated with the risk of developing colorectal neoplasia. <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> also shows that, among the study subjects, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and hypertension were positively associated with the risk of developing CRC and colorectal neoplasia. <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows that the presence of IBS was positively associated with the risk for developing adenoma and/or invasive carcinoma of the colon. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows the comparison of two cumulative incidences of colorectal adenoma according to the presence of IBS. Subjects with IBS had higher cumulative incidence of colorectal adenoma at 10 years of follow-up (30.6‰ <italic>vs</italic> 21.9‰). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows the higher incidence of CRC in subjects with IBS compared with those without IBS after a 10-year follow-up (14.3‰ <italic>vs</italic> 9.2‰). <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of IBS for the risk of adenoma, CRC and colorectal neoplasia. Subjects with IBS had a 21% increased risk (95% CI: 2–42%) of developing adenoma after adjusting for specifying the factors instead of age, gender, BMI, CRC family history, alcohol drinking, education and hypertension. A similar finding, albeit not statistically significant (HR=1.20; 95% CI: 0.94–1.53), was noted for the risk of CRC after the adjustment for other confounding factors, such as family history of CRC, diabetes and BMI.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The estimated prevalence of IBS was 23.3% in our study, which is similar to the estimated prevalence from a previous questionnaire survey study in Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lu <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Moreover, there was no significant difference of IBS prevalence among different genders noted by the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lu <italic>et al</italic> (2003)</xref> and our present study. Our study demonstrated that the prevalence rates of IBS increased with age from 14.7% for ages 40–49 years to 43.7% for ages over 70 years. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lu <italic>et al</italic> (2003)</xref> found that the IBS prevalence decreased significantly with advancing age. In their study, the IBS prevalence was 34.1% for ages 30–39 years, 25% for ages 40–49 years and 18.6% for ages over 70 years. The participants of the previous study, who were enroled from voluntarily health check-up, might represent a more healthy population with high motivation for health behaviour. Therefore, the IBS prevalence of the general population that is inferred from the health check-up population might be underestimated.</p>
      <p>Our study population was a community-based screening cohort. In contrast to the diagnosis of IBS using the Rome II questionnaire survey, we used national health insurance data to make the IBS diagnosis. As a portion of IBS patients, especially those with mild symptoms, do not seek medical help, underestimation of the prevalence of IBS is highly suspected, especially among younger people. This could explain why our study showed a lower IBS prevalence among people aged 40–49 years than what was found in the previous study.</p>
      <p>In the past, IBS was viewed as a purely functional disorder. However, in recent years, numerous data have suggested that immune activation occurs in IBS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Matricon <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>) and is more frequently observed in IBS patients than in healthy controls. Several studies have reported an increase in the number of mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barbara <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cremon <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), and intestinal permeabilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Piche <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>) of the colon and rectum in IBS patients. The hypothesis of patients with a long-term course of IBS having the potential risk of developing colorectal disease is considered.</p>
      <p>In the present study, we found that IBS patients were associated with a significantly higher risk of colorectal adenoma and colon neoplasia compared with those without IBS. Three possible reasons could explain why IBS patients have a higher risk of developing colon neoplasia. First, IBS and colon neoplasia have similar clinical symptoms that result in the higher detection rate of colon neoplasia. Second, IBS and colon neoplasia share common risk factors. Third, IBS has a causal role in the pathogenesis of colon neoplasia.</p>
      <p>Two previous studies from the United Kingdom and Denmark revealed a lack of relationship between IBS and CRC after excluding CRCs within the first year of follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Garcia Rodriguez <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Nørgaard <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). The overlapping symptoms among IBS and colon rectal cancer can result in diagnostic confusion and are considered to be the major cause of the increased risk of CRC in the first year after IBS diagnosis. However, our study demonstrated that IBS patients have a higher risk of developing colon neoplasia, especially colon adenoma. IBS is a clinical syndrome characterised by chronic abdominal pain, discomfort and altered bowel habits. The majority of colon adenomas are usually asymptomatic but can present as abdominal pain, change of bowel habits or occult bleeding if the tumour size increases. The clinical symptoms of IBS and colon neoplasia/adenoma are not highly correlated. Therefore, the significant relationship between IBS and the incidence of colon neoplasia is less likely caused by the similar symptoms of IBS and colon neoplasia.</p>
      <p>IBS is a clinical syndrome diagnosed by clinical presentation after removal of the structural abnormality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Drossman <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). To rule out the possibility of structural or pathological lesions of the large bowel, colonoscopy is performed in the clinical setting, and more frequent colonoscopy examinations will increase the detection rate of colon neoplasia. However, different from the previous UK study that used the general practitioners' database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Nørgaard <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>), our study cohort was enroled from a community-screening project. Colonoscopy was performed in a screening setting and was not based on clinical symptoms. It is possible that bias in increasing surveillance for colorectal lesion may affect the ascertainment of incident colorectal neoplasia in subjects with IBS compared with those without. However, as the percentage of CRCs diagnosed by colonoscopy in our screening setting was similar between the IBS and non-IBS groups (82% for the IBS group and 81% for the non-IBS group), an increased frequency of colonoscopic examination (in a nonscreening setting) because of the demands of the clinical symptoms of IBS is less likely.</p>
      <p>The risk factors of IBS are still unclear; however, several have been identified by epidemiologic studies over the past few decades. However, it is difficult to separate factors promoting health-care seeking from true risk factors for the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Rey and Talley, 2009</xref>). Genetic background and early life events are proposed to be potential risk factors for IBS, and diet composition may be related to IBS. A recent Taiwanese study showed that smoking, obesity and metabolic syndrome were associated with increased risk of colon neoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hu <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Although IBS and colon neoplasia may share common risk factors, our study found that IBS still had an independent and significant effect of increasing the risk of colon neoplasia after adjusting for smoking, BMI, DM and family history of CRC. However, the possibility of potentially unmeasured confounding factors that results in this association of IBS and colon neoplasia still could not be excluded. Further, more studies to discover the association of IBS and the risk of colon neoplasia and to explore the possibility of the causal role of IBS in the development of colon neoplasia are needed in the future.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Our study finds a significant association between IBS and colon neoplasia, and it provides an important suggestion to clinical physicians: they should pay more attention to IBS and the possibility of colon neoplasia or CRC in patients.</p>

          <title>Background:</title>
          <p>p53 is a transcription factor with tumour suppressor properties, which is able to induce mitochondrial apoptosis independently of its transcriptional activity. We recently synthesised two new compounds (ISA27 and SM13), which block p53-MDM2 interaction and induce apoptosis in p53 wild-type (WT) tumour cells. The aim of this study was to verify the effectiveness of these compounds in tumours carrying a mutated form of p53 gene with no transcriptional activity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods:</title>
          <p><italic>In vitro</italic> we evaluated the effectiveness of our compounds in cancer cell lines carrying WT, mutated and null p53 gene. <italic>In vivo</italic> study was performed in Balb/c nude mice and the mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic signalling was evaluated by western blot.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results:</title>
          <p>Both ISA27 and SM13 reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic> in cells carrying either p53 WT or mutated gene, suggesting that its effect is independent from p53 transcriptional activity. On the contrary, SM13 had no effect in a p53 null cell line. <italic>In vivo</italic>, ISA27 and SM13 induced cancer cell death in a dose-dependent manner through the activation of the mitochondrial-dependent death signalling in p53-mutated cells. <italic>In vivo</italic>, SM13 reduced tumour growth.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions:</title>
          <p>Our study proposes SM13 as anticancer compound to use for the treatment of p53-dependent tumours, even in the absence of p53 transcriptional activity.</p>

  <body>
    <p>p53 is best known as a transcription factor that binds to specific DNA sequences and transactivates a number of genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Riley <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). In addition to this nuclear activity, p53 also possesses transcription-independent biological activities that take place far from the nucleus. Indeed, the overexpression of a mutant p53, lacking most of the DNA-binding domain and completely deficient in transactivation function, can efficiently induce apoptosis in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haupt <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kakudo <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Under a variety of cell-death-inducing conditions, p53 rapidly moves to mitochondria where it induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation, thereby triggering the release of pro-apoptotic factors from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kroemer <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
    <p>p53 family protein activity is regulated in a complex way, including posttranslational modifications, protein stabilisation, protein–protein interaction and modulation of subcellular localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harms <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourdon <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harms and Chen, 2005</xref>).</p>
    <p>In particular, p53 binds MDM2, an ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates p53 protein and causes inactivation, nuclear export and degradation of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Momand <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haupt <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geyer <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). In turn, p53 enhances the expression of MDM2, although MDM2 levels can be also regulated via p53-independent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Phelps <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Therefore, MDM2 induction in response to p53 is the major negative feedback loop aimed at blocking p53 proapoptotic function and thus allowing cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malaguarnera <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). As most of human cancers are p53-dependent owing to inactivating mutations of p53 gene, overexpression of its inhibitors, reduction of its activators or inactivation of its downstream targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Green and Kroemer, 2009</xref>), the possibility to disrupt the MDM2-p53 interaction to enhance p53-dependent inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and survival, has become an attractive goal for cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). In the last years, several potent small molecules, which disrupt MDM2-p53 interaction, have been developed and one of them, Nutlin-3, has entered early phase clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shangary and Wang, 2009</xref>). In the clinical scenario, different cancers express different levels of p53 and also p53 mutant variants, leading to resistance to p53-targeting compounds. On the basis of these findings, we recently synthesised two new compounds:(3<italic>R</italic>,7<italic>aR</italic>)-6-(4-chlorobenzyl)-1<italic>H</italic>-spiro[imidazo[1,5-<italic>c</italic>]thiazole-3,3′-indoline]-2′,5,7(6<italic>H</italic>,7<italic>aH</italic>)-trione (<bold>9c</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gomez-Monterrey <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>), named ISA27, and 5-bromo-3'-(cyclohexane carbonyl)-1-methyl-2-oxospiro[indoline-3,2'-thiazolidine] (<bold>4n</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertamino <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>), named SM13. These compounds are able to induce apoptosis of human tumour cell lines both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gomez-Monterrey <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertamino <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). SM13, in particular, is a promising anticancer compound, which has proven to be more effective than Nutlin at lower doses in different tumour cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertamino <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). We have demonstrated that SM13 inhibits MDM2-induced p53 degradation and activates apoptotic events <italic>in vitro</italic> in human tumour cells carrying a wild-type (WT) p53 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertamino <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). So far, its efficacy has never been tested <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, the efficacy of these compounds has never been tested in tumours bearing p53 variants-lacking transcriptional activity. It is possible to speculate that in these cancers, p53 accumulation can still be effective to inhibit cancer growth by enhancing mitochondrial apoptosis. The present study was therefore undertaken to verify whether SM13 and ISA27 retain effectiveness in cancer cells with mutated p53. Also, as SM13 was never tested <italic>in vivo</italic>, we sought to verify whether the compound is as efficient <italic>in vivo</italic> as <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

        <title><italic>In vivo</italic> study design</title>
        <p>Experiments were carried out, in accordance to NIH guidelines for Animal Investigation, in 6-week-old BALB/c nude mice (Charles River Italia, Calco, Italy), which had access to food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. For tumour formation, a suspension containing 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> KAT-4 cells in 200 <italic>μ</italic>l of DMEM were injected subcutaneously in the dorsal side of nude mice, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sorriento <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). Animals were anesthetised using isofluorane 2%. We used mice that developed tumours of ∼6 mm in diameter by 2 weeks. Mice were divided into four groups (5 mice per group) and administered twice a week for 2 weeks with intra-tumour or intra-peritoneal injections (IP) of the specific treatment (ISA27 and SM13).</p>
        <p>In particular, two groups received intra-tumour injection of ISA27 or SM13 either at low (low: 1 mg kg<sup>–1</sup>) or high dosages (high: 3 mg kg<sup>–1</sup>); another group received IP of 5 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> of the compounds and; the control group received intra-tumour or IP of DMSO. The IP of DMSO did not modify tumour growth with respect to intra-tumour injection, thus in figures we include intra-tumour injection of DMSO as control for treated tumours. Tumour growth was measured by caliper twice a week and expressed as tumour volumes in mm<sup>3</sup> according to the formula ‘Volume=(width)<sup>2</sup> × length/2'. At the end of the treatment, mice were killed by cervical dislocation and tumours were processed for biochemical or histological analysis.

        <title>Effects of ISA27 in different tumour cell lines</title>
        <p>We evaluated the effect of ISA27 on p53 levels and activation of caspase 3 in MCF-7 (carrying p53 WT gene), BHT-101 and KAT-4 cells (carrying p53 mutated gene). In all these cell lines, ISA27 increases both p53 and cleaved caspase 3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that it inhibits MDM2-dependent p53 degradation and increases apoptotic events in all cell lines. As ISA27 exerts the same effect in p53 WT (MCF7) and p53-mutated cells (KAT-4 and BHT-101) and given the hotspot mutation of p53 within the DNA-binding domain in KAT-4 and BHT-101 cells, which inhibits its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blagosklonny <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>), the effect of ISA27 in the regulation of apoptosis should be independent from p53 transcriptional activity. We therefore performed the study in KAT-4 cells, which represent a well-established model for cancer studies in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sorriento <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). We first confirmed the effectiveness of ISA27 to disrupt MDM2/p53 binding in KAT-4 cells by co-immunoprecipitation assay. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref> shows that MDM2-precipitated p53 and ISA27 reduced this phenomenon. ISA27-dependent increase of p53 levels is due to the inhibition of protein degradation rather than the induction of p53 gene expression. Indeed, p53 gene expression levels, evaluated by RT PCR, were unchanged in treated cells compared with controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). To evaluate the effect of ISA27 on tumour cell growth, we studied <italic>in vitro</italic> cell proliferation indicators such as cell number and DNA synthesis. ISA27 inhibits both cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) in a time-dependent manner. This finding suggests that ISA27 is able to induce p53-dependent apoptosis also in KAT-4 cells harboring the p53 variant.</p>

        <title>Effects of ISA27 on KAT-4 cell growth <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
        <p>To confirm <italic>in vitro</italic> data, we tested the effect of ISA27 <italic>in vivo</italic>. In BALB/c nude mice, the injection of 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> KAT-4 cells in the dorsal lateral region results in the development of a ∼6-mm diameter tumour in 2 weeks, in about 70% of mice. Tumours were treated with different doses of ISA27 by means of IP or intra-tumour injection, as described in Materials and Methods. The effect of ISA27 on tumour growth appears to be dose-dependent. Indeed, intra-tumour injection of high doses (3 mg kg<sup>–1</sup>) leads to a progressive regression of tumour, whereas low doses (1 mg kg<sup>–1</sup>) or intra-peritoneal treatment (5 mg kg<sup>–1</sup>) can only delay tumour growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). At the end of the treatment, mice were killed and tumours were taken for biochemical and histological analysis. We first evaluated p53 and MDM2 levels by western blot to confirm the effectiveness of the treatment <italic>in vivo</italic>. The p53 levels were increased in all treated tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Also, MDM2 levels were increased in treated tumours with respect to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), probably as a compensative response to the increased levels of p53. We then evaluated apoptosis and proliferation in tumours by western blot. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows that ISA27 increased cleaved caspase 3 levels and reduced the phosphorylation of RB in a dose-dependent manner. These results were confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis in paraffin-embedded sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). ISA27-treated tumours show dose-dependent increase of cleaved caspase 3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and a reduction of PCNA expression, marker of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These data confirm that ISA27 induces apoptosis also <italic>in vivo</italic> in a dose-dependent manner.</p>

        <title>Effects of SM13 on KAT-4 cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
        <p>The effectiveness of the nutlin-derivate compound, SM13, in the regulation of apoptotic signalling in a p53 WT tumour cell line (MCF-7) has already been demonstrated. Here we evaluated its effects also in a p53 mutant cell line, KAT-4. We first confirmed the effectiveness of SM13 to disrupt MDM2/p53 binding by co-immunoprecipitation assay. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref> shows that MDM2 precipitated p53 and SM13 reduced this phenomenon. We then tested the effect of SM13 on tumour cell growth <italic>in vitro</italic>. SM13 reduced KAT-4 cell proliferation both at 24 and 48 h from starting treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Giving the mutation of p53 gene in KAT-4 cells, which inhibits its transcriptional activity, we evaluated the effect of SM13 on mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic signalling. Indeed, recent studies have shown that interactions of p53 with various members of the Bcl-2 family cause mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Speidel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ha <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Accordingly, our data showed that SM13 induced p53 levels, increased the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax, leading to the release of cytochrome c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This event leads to the activation of both Caspase 9 and Caspase 3, thus, inducing cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Accordingly, also the levels of Cyt-c in cytosolic extracts were increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>). We have showed above that ISA27 induced an increase of p53 levels by inhibiting protein degradation without modifying its gene expression levels. We demonstrated that also SM13 did not modify gene expression of p53 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>), thus confirming that SM13 rather inhibits p53 degradation. To confirm the apoptotic effect of SM13, we evaluated DNA fragmentation through a Tunel assay. Images show that treatment with SM13 induced apoptotic events in tumour cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). All together, these data suggest that SM13 is able to induce apoptosis in tumour cells by activating mitochondrial apoptotic signalling. To assess the specificity of SM13 effectiveness in the regulation of p53-dependent apoptosis, we evaluated its effects in FRO cells, a tumour cell line which does not express p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wolf and Rotter, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Namba <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> shows that SM13 increased cleaved caspase 3 levels in KAT-4, but not in FRO cells; thus, suggesting that the ability of SM13 to induce apoptosis strictly depends on p53. Moreover, to confirm the p53 transcription independent effect of SM13, we evaluated gene expression of p53 target genes, p21 and Gadd45. In a p53 WT tumour cell line, MCF7, the treatment with SM13 induced p21 and Gadd45 gene expression, whereas in p53-mutant cell type, KAT-4, such phenomenon was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These data suggest that the effects of SM13 are strictly dependent on p53, and given the lack of transcriptional activity of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), they are due to the activation of p53-dependent mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.</p>

        <title>Effects of SM13 on KAT-4 cell growth <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
        <p>To confirm <italic>in vitro</italic> data, we evaluated the effect of SM13 on tumour growth <italic>in vivo</italic> in nude mice. Tumours were treated with IP and intra-tumour injection of SM13. Data show that SM13 is a potent inhibitor of tumour growth in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Indeed, the intra-tumour injection of SM13 inhibited tumour growth at low dosages and was more efficient at high dosages. Also, the intra-peritoneal treatment strongly delayed tumour growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We compared ISA27 and SM13 effects on tumour growth and we found that at equal doses, SM13 is more effective than ISA27 to inhibit the progression of tumour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Indeed, when comparing the effect on tumour growth, the three different treatment regimens consistently showed the advantage of SM13 over ISA27. Indeed, the intra-peritoneal treatment with SM13 (5 mg kg<sup>–1</sup>) more efficiently delayed tumour growth compared with ISA27 (−77±2.6% <italic>vs</italic> −56±2% at 14 days, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). Similarly, the intra tumour injection at low dosages of SM13 (1 mg kg<sup>–1</sup>) is more effective than the treatment with low dosages of ISA27 (SM13: −85±2% ISA27: −68±3.4% at 14 days, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). Finally, the intra tumour injection of high dosages of SM13 (3 mg kg<sup>–1</sup>) induces tumour regression more efficiently than ISA27 (−98±1.6% <italic>vs</italic> −80±1.6% at 14 days, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). It was already evidenced that ISA27 and SM13 showed different minimal inhibitory concentration 50%, IC50, (SM13: 0.03 <italic>μ</italic><sc>M</sc>±0.01; ISA27: 0.40 <italic>μ</italic><sc>M</sc>±0.02) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gomez-Monterrey <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertamino <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>) demonstrating that SM13 is 10-fold more potent than ISA27, and this is in agreement with their different effect on tumour growth at the same doses. Thus, besides the good anticancer properties of ISA27, our data show that SM13 is more efficient compared with ISA27 to inhibit tumour growth <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
        <p>To confirm the mechanism by which SM13 induced apoptosis, we evaluated its effect on mitochondrial signalling in tumours from treated and control mice. According to <italic>in vitro</italic> data, intra-tumour injection of low and high doses of SM13 significantly increased p53, Bax, Cit-C, active caspase 9 and active caspase 3 levels in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Cell death and proliferation were also evaluated by immunohistochemistry analysis of cleaved caspase 3 and PCNA levels in tumours collected from control and treated mice. SM13-treated tumours show a dose-dependent reduction of cell proliferation (PCNA: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and an increase of apoptosis (Cleaved caspase 3: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To further confirm the effect of SM13 on tumour growth, we analyzed by RT PCR the expression of genes key to tumour progression and metastatisation, which are usually overexpressed in tumour cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows that VEGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), MMP-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), TNF<italic>α</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and IL-1<italic>β</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) expression significantly decreased in treated tumours compared with controls in a dose-dependent manner, confirming the effectiveness of the treatment to reduce tumour growth.</p>

        <title>Evaluation of side effects after treatment with ISA27 and SM13</title>
        <p>Finally, we tested the safety of <italic>in vivo</italic> administration of our compounds in healthy nude mice. There were no significant changes in body weight among treated and control groups of mice (data not shown). Internal organs (liver and kidneys) were collected from controls and treated mice and morphological analysis was performed by Masson trichrome staining in paraffin-embedded sections. No morphological differences were found in tissues from treated mice compared with controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). These data indicate that the treatments with ISA27 and SM13 had no effects on mice health at the doses and time of treatment that were used in this study.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our results show for the first time that ISA27 and SM13 are two potent inhibitors of cancer cell proliferation even in cancer cells bearing a p53 mutated-variant. p53 is a known tumour suppressor, which regulates several events, like growth arrest, senescence and apoptosis, in response to cellular damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Levine, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wu and Levine, 1997</xref>). In basal conditions, p53 is expressed at low levels in cells owing to its continuous MDM2-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Levine, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wu and Levine, 1997</xref>). Rapid induction of p53 protein levels by various stress types prevents inappropriate propagation of cells carrying damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moll and Petrenko, 2003</xref>). p53 exerts its pro-apoptotic effect in a transcription-dependent manner in the nucleus and in a transcription independent manner in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vousden and Lu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mihara <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Recently, MDM2 has emerged as the main regulator of p53 by limiting the p53 tumour suppressor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Momand <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Finlay, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). Indeed, small molecules have been developed recently to disrupt MDM2-p53 binding, which have been proposed as anticancer therapeutic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shangary and Wang, 2009</xref>). In this context, we have designed and synthesised a series of small molecules, which are analogues of spirooxoindolepyrrolidine nucleus and inhibit MDM2-dependent degradation of p53 by preventing p53/MDM2 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gomez-Monterrey <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Among them, ISA27 resulted the most potent compound to regulate p53 activity. We have recently demonstrated that ISA27 induces p53-dependent apoptosis in a human tumour cell line carrying a WT p53 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Here we show that such effect is reproducible also in tumour cells carrying a mutated p53 gene, which prevents p53 ability to activate transcription of target genes. On the basis of ISA27 structure, we designed and synthesised a series of new modified compounds, which should be more selective and effective than ISA27. These analogues of ISA27 were prepared to explore new structural requirements at the thiazolidine domain for the antiproliferative activity and p53 modulation. Among them, the 5-bromo-3′-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-1-methyl-2-oxospiro[indoline-3,2′-thiazolidine]-4′-carboxylate (SM13) emerged as the most potent compound, as it inhibits cell growth in different human tumour cell lines at submicromolar and nanomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertamino <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Docking studies confirmed the interactions of SM13 with the well-known Trp23 and Phe19 clefts, explaining the reasons for its binding affinity for MDM2. SM13 at low doses is capable of inducing the accumulation of p53 protein, inducing significant apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Here we demonstrated that SM13, better than its precursor ISA27, is a potent inhibitor of tumour growth in cells carrying a mutated p53 gene and is already effective at low dosages. It is known that p53 induces apoptotic events through the regulation of gene transcription in the nucleus. Recently, it has been shown that this protein is also able to induce apoptosis in a transcription independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), which is based on the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arima <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Indeed, it directly induces permeabilisation of the outer mitochondrial membrane by forming complexes with antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and Bcl-2, resulting in the release of cytochrome c in the cytosol. Moreover, it has been shown that p53 translocation to mitochondria occurs earlier after TPA stimulation, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). The specific signalling involved in this transcriptional-independent effect of p53 on apoptosis is still unclear. What is known is that the transcriptional blockade of p53 by <italic>α</italic>-amanitin induces p53 mitochondrial localisation and Bax accumulation, and activation in mitochondria. Accordingly, here we show that SM13 induces apoptosis of KAT-4 cells, which express a mutated p53 protein lacking the transcriptional activity, by targeting p53-dependent mitochondrial signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Indeed, the SM13-dependent increase of p53 levels, in KAT-4 cells is associated with the increase of BAX, release of cytochrome c, increase of cleaved caspase 3 levels and, finally, cell death. The confirmation that such mechanism strictly depends on p53, either WT or transcription activity deficient, derives from the finding that SM13 has no effect on FRO cells, a cell line that does not express p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wolf and Rotter, 1985</xref>). It could be a compensatory response in those conditions, like cancer, in which p53 cannot activate gene transcription, but must induce cell death to block a pathological increase of cell growth. In conclusion, here we demonstrate that both ISA27 and SM13 are effective regulators of p53 in KAT-4 cells. Among them, SM13 seems to be the most effective as it leads to a progressive tumour regression at lower doses. In treating human tumours, a combination of selected drugs with different mechanisms of action and a low toxicity grade is preferred over monotherapy. In this context, SM13 could be a good anticancer drug to be used in combination chemotherapy, as it is selective and does not generate side effects. In this study, we demonstrated that SM13 has strong pro-apoptotic effects by regulating p53 turnover within the cell and it could be used as a prototype small molecule for cancer therapy. In conclusion, we propose SM13 as a feasible anticancer drug, which could be used alone or in combination with common anticancer agents to ameliorate the response to chemotherapy in a wide set of tumour types characterised by elevated levels of MDM2 and low levels of p53.</p>

        <p><bold>Effects of ISA27 on tumour cell growth <italic>in vitro</italic>.</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) The effect of ISA 27 on p53 and cleaved caspase 3 levels were evaluated in whole lysates from different tumour cell lines by western blot. In all MCF-7, BHT-101 and KAT-4 cells, the treatment with ISA 27 increases p53 levels and consequently leads to an increase of apoptotic signalling. Actin was used as loading control. Images are representative of three independent experiments. (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>C)</bold> KAT-4 cells were treated with ISA27 for 24 and 48 h and cell proliferation was analyzed (<bold>B</bold>). ISA27 reduces cell proliferation in a time-dependent manner. Results are the mean of five independent experiments and are presented as mean±s.e.m. This effect was confirmed by analysis of DNA synthesis by means of tritiated thymidine incorporation (<bold>C</bold>). DNA synthesis was reduced by ISA27 treatment (*<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 <italic>vs</italic> control 24H; **<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 <italic>vs</italic> control 48H). Results are the mean of five independent experiments and are presented as mean±s.e.m.</p>

        <p><bold>Effects of ISA27 on tumour growth <italic>in vivo</italic>.</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) To validate our <italic>in vitro</italic> results, we studied the effects of ISA27 in a cancer model <italic>in vivo</italic>. Tumour growth was measured twice a week by a caliper during all the treatment long (14 days of treatment). Intra-peritoneal treatment (IP: 5 mg Kg<sup>–1</sup>) or low doses (LOW: 1 mg Kg<sup>–1</sup>) of ISA27 retard tumour growth compared with controls. High doses (HIGH: 3 mg Kg<sup>–1</sup>) are more effective, significantly reducing tumour size. Results are the mean of measurements from five mice per group (*<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 <italic>vs</italic> control). The upper panel shows a representative image of tumours at the end of the treatment. (<bold>B</bold>) Tumours were homogenized and MDM2, p53, active caspase 3, and RB levels were analyzed. Actin was used as control. ISA27 induces an increase of p53 and cleaved caspase 3 levels and a reduction of p-RB expression in treated tumours compared with controls. MDM2 level were unchanged in treated tumours with respect to controls. Images are representative of three independent experiments.</p>

Cell death and proliferation were evaluated by analysis of cleaved caspase 3 and PCNA levels by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded sections of tumours. ISA27-treated tumours show a dose-dependent increased cleaved caspase 3 levels (<bold>B</bold>) and reduced cell proliferation (<bold>A</bold>).

        <p><bold>Effects of SM13 on tumour cell growth <italic>in vitro</italic>.</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) KAT-4 cells were treated with SM13 for 24 and 48 h, and cell proliferation was analyzed. SM13 reduced cell proliferation in a time-dependent manner (*<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 <italic>vs</italic> control 24H; **<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 <italic>vs</italic> control 48H). Results are representative of five independent experiments and are presented as mean±s.e.m. (<bold>B</bold>) To evaluate the mechanism of action of SM13, we analyzed its effect on mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic signalling by western blot. SM13-dependent increase of p53 induces activation of Bax, release of citochrome c from mitochondria and activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3. Images are the mean of three independent experiments.

(<bold>E)</bold> To confirm the p53 transcription-independent effect of SM13, we evaluated gene expression of p53 target genes, p21 and Gadd45. In a p53 WT tumour cell line, MCF7, the treatment with SM13 induced p21 and Gadd45 gene expression, whereas in p53-mutant cell type, KAT-4, such phenomenon was reduced (*<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 <italic>vs</italic> control).

        <p><bold>p53 transcription-dependent and -independent activation of apoptotic pathway.</bold> (<bold>A)</bold> p53 is activated in response to DNA damage and induces the apoptotic pathway through two alternative mechanisms, one dependent on transcriptional activity of p53 and one independent from transcriptional activity of p53. Indeed, activated p53 can move towards nucleus to activate the transcription of pro-apoptotic genes or move towards mitochondria to induce the release of cytochrome c. (<bold>B)</bold> Under basal conditions, MDM2 binds p53, thus leading to the degradation of the protein. SM13 inhibits MDM2/p53 binding by competing with p53 for binding to MDM2. SM13 therefore leads to the inhibition of MDM2-dependent degradation of p53 and to the increase of p53 levels. p53 binds and inhibits antiapoptotic proteins (BclXL); thus, inducing Bax levels on mitochondrial membrane, which leads to the release of citochrome c from mitochondria that on turn activates apoptotic events.</p>

          <title>Background:</title>
          <p>Sunitinib (VEGFR/PDGFR inhibitor) and everolimus (mTOR inhibitor) are both approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as first-line and second-line therapy, respectively. In the clinics, sunitinib treatment is limited by the emergence of acquired resistance, leading to a switch to second-line treatment at progression, often based on everolimus. No data have been yet generated on programmed alternating sequential strategies combining alternative use of sunitinib and everolimus before progression. Such strategy is expected to delay the emergence of acquired resistance and improve tumour control. The aim of our study was to assess the changes in tumours induced by three different sequences administration of sunitinib and everolimus.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods:</title>
          <p>In human Caki-1 RCC xenograft model, sunitinib was alternated with everolimus every week, every 2 weeks, or every 3 weeks. Effects on necrosis, hypoxia, angiogenesis, and EMT status were assessed by immunohisochemistry and immunofluorescence.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results:</title>
          <p>Sunitinib and everolimus programmed sequential regimens before progression yielded longer median time to tumour progression than sunitinib and everolimus monotherapies. In each group of treatment, tumour growth control was associated with inhibition of mTOR pathway and changes from a mesenchymal towards an epithelial phenotype, with a decrease in vimentin and an increase in E-cadherin expression. The sequential combinations of these two agents in a RCC mouse clinical trial induced antiangiogenic effects, leading to tumour necrosis.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions:</title>
          <p>In summary, our study showed that alternate sequence of sunitinib and everolimus mitigated the development of mesenchymal phenotype compared with sunitinib as single agent.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been rising steadily and now accounts for 2–3% of all adult cancers worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen and McGovern, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ljungberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC) stands as the main pathological subtype (80–90%), papillary RCC and chromophobe RCC being the two other major types of RCC according to the WHO tumour classification. Recent data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) identified ccRCC as a highly metabolically deregulated cancer and a model for the role of a metabolic shift or ‘Warburg effect' observed in the acquisition of cell malignancy. Molecular characterisation of ccRCC and preclinical investigations highlighted the importance of the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) gene alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Creighton <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>), inhibition of VHL function through mutations, or epigenetic silencing occurring ∼60–75% of tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gossage <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). von Hippel–Lindau is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), HIF1<italic>α</italic> and HIF2<italic>α</italic>, for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cockman <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). von Hippel–Lindau loss-of-function induces HIF1<italic>α</italic> stabilisation and the constitutive transcription of several genes involved in differentiation, angiogenesis, and metabolism regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pugh and Ratcliffe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chiatar <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Semenza, 2013</xref>). Integrated analyses from the TCGA also highlighted that other pathways, especially the chromatin remodelling and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, were important in ccRCC tumourigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Creighton <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway can be identified in about 28% of tumours and are only partially overlapping with VHL dysfunctions. Consistent with metabolic dysfunctions in ccRCC, downregulation of the AMP-activated kinase, upregulation of pentose phosphate and fatty acid synthesis pathway genes, as well as upregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway correlated with worse survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Creighton <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p>
    <p>As a result of HIF activation by hypoxia or VHL mutations, as well as mTOR pathway dysfunctions, ccRCCs also acknowledged as highly vascularised, mainly through the paracrine secretion of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) by cancer cells. Inhibition of the VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) by small tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as sunitinib that was the first TKI approved for advanced RCC, markedly improved the progression-free survival (PFS) and the overall clinical outcome of these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schoffski <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Faivre <italic>et al</italic>, 2006a</xref>). Sunitinib has a long stand as the standard of care for first-line therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Motzer <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) but despite evident clinical benefits, it is now accepted that most patients eventually progress after few months of therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faivre <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Loss of sunitinib activity was thought to be due to tumour cell plasticity that allows tumour cells, endothelial cells, and pericytes to adapt to their changing VEGFR-independent microenvironment by activating other survival and angiogenic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gassenmaier <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Data have also suggested that tumour adaptation to angiogenesis inhibition may trigger tumour aggressiveness, facilitating occurrence of metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ebos <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paez-Ribes <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). In renal cancer models, data have suggested that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway could be involved in resistance to sunitinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Makhov <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Currently, clinical evidences of resistance to sunitinib lead most patients to switch for a second-line therapy based on either mTOR inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Faivre <italic>et al</italic>, 2006b</xref>) such as everolimus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Motzer <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2010</xref>) or on small TKIs whose inhibitory spectrum differs to some extend from sunitinib, such as sorafenib or pazopanib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keisner and Shah, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonso <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). In fact, emerging evidence showed that everolimus may display both antiangiogenic and antitumour activities and that these effects may counteract sunitinib resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lane <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuereder <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Taking advantage of potentially distinct mechanism of action on cell signalling, authors have attempted to combine everolimus with sunitinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuereder <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). However, these attempts were limited by significant, that is, severe dose-limiting acute and chronic toxicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Molina <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p>
    <p>Concomitant use of sunitinib and everolimus being prohibited by toxicity, sequential administration of both drugs has been proposed with the goal of switching drugs at fixed time points before acquired resistance may have a chance to emerge. In this study, we designed a preset strategy using sequential administration of sunitinib and everolimus before progression in human RCC xenograft models.</p>

        <p>All the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments were carried out with ethical committee approval and met the standards required by the UKCCCR guidelines. A total of 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> Caki-1 renal cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into the flank of female athymic nude mice (Janvier, Le Genest St Isle, France). One week after cell inoculation, all mice developed single subcutaneous palpable tumours of ∼50–100 mm<sup>3</sup>. Mice were arbitrarily placed in the groups of treatment. Mice were then treated 5 days a week by oral gavages with 60 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> per day sunitinib (<italic>n</italic>=5), 10 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> per day everolimus (<italic>n</italic>=5), or sequential regimens that alternate sunitinib and everolimus for 1 (<italic>n</italic>=5), 2 (<italic>n</italic>=5), or 3 weeks (<italic>n</italic>=5), or only with the sterilised solution (control group, <italic>n</italic>=6). To choose the everolimus concentration, a pilot study was performed in this model using five different concentrations as following: 1, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> per day. Tumour growth inhibition was observed from 5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> per day, and was significant at 10 and 20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> per day. To minimise the toxicity in the sequential regimens, we choose the lowest effective concentration of everolimus, that is, 10 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> per day. Moreover, this concentration was shown to delay tumour growth <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">O'Reilly <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Larkin <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>).Tumour volumes were measured twice a week along two major axes using a caliper. Tumour volumes were calculated as follows: tumour volume=((length) × (width<sup>2</sup>))/2. Tumours were considered progressive when, among the three consecutive increasing measures, tumour volumes displayed a 30% increase compared with the smallest tumour measurement (NADIR). Time to tumour progression (TTP) was defined as the time from start of drug administration to first evidence of tumour progression. Our study defined two main tumour responses as following: (i) sustained (ST) tumour control, that is, partial response followed by tumour volume stabilisation or slow tumour volume progression, or (ii) tumour progression (PG), that is, tumour volume stabilisation followed by quick disease progression. Partial response in the treated groups was defined as a minimum of 30% tumour volume reduction from baseline. At day 66, when all placebo-treated mice were killed, ST tumour control was confirmed whether tumour volumes had not doubled in size from baseline. If tumour volumes were over twice the baseline volumes, mice were considered to belong to the tumour PG group. When tumour volumes reached 2 cm<sup>3</sup>, mice were killed. Body and tumour weight were recorded. After mice were killed, tumours were excised and OCT embedded (VWR, Fontenay-sous-bois, France) to prevent tissue degradation from frozen conservation.</p>

        <p>The immunohistochemical procedure was performed on OCT-embedded subcutaneous tumour stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE), and carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA-IX) (NB-100-417, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) using an automated immunohistochemical stainer. The images were captured and analysed with a Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Quantifications were performed using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) for HE and CA-IX staining. Necrotic areas were defined as tumour section areas where cells displayed pycnotic nucleus or no nucleus. Necrotic tissues are characterised by a strong pink colour, as observed in Figure 3.</p>

        <title>Effects of sequential administrations of sunitinib and everolimus on tumour PG</title>
        <p>Caki-1 cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. After 1 week, when tumours became palpable (50–100 mm<sup>3</sup>), the mice were randomly assigned to six treatment groups including vehicle control, sunitinib 60 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> per day, everolimus 10 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> per day, or alternate administration of sunitinib (S) and everolimus (E) every week (1W), every 2 weeks (2W), or every 3 weeks (3W) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Tumour growth was followed by measuring tumour volume twice a week (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Tumours were considered progressive when, among three consecutive increasing measures, tumour volumes displayed a ⩾30% increase compared with the smallest tumour measurement. Median TTP (mTTP) in vehicle, sunitinib, and everolimus groups was 24, 36, and 50 days, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). When analysed as a single group, alternated sequential treatments improved the mTTP to 59 days. More specifically, mTTP in the 1, 2, and 3W groups were 64, 59, and 59 days, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This improvement represented a 2.5-fold increase in mTTP compared with the control treatment group and a 20–80% increase compared with single agents sunitinib or everolimus.</p>

        <title>Effects of preset sequences of sunitinib and everolimus on tumour angiogenesis</title>
        <p>Tumour angiogenesis was analysed by CD31 staining, a surface marker of endothelial cells allowing evaluation of the number of vessel and the vascular area of tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In all treated groups, the number of vessels was significantly decreased relative to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In accordance with the known antiangiogenic effects of sunitinib, sunitinib alone and alternated sequences containing sunitinib induced a reduction in the number of vessels in comparison to treatment with everolimus alone. In addition, the vascular areas were significantly decreased in all of the treated tumours compared with control, confirming that sunitinib- and everolimus-based treatments could directly affect angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Among the alternated sequential regimens, the 1W regimen displayed the strongest effects on vascular area reduction, whereas the 2 and 3W regimens had similar effects as the single agents sunitinib or everolimus.</p>

        <title>Discrete effects of sunitinib and everolimus on necrosis and hypoxia induction</title>
        <p>Necrosis, as determined by HE staining, was significantly increased in the tumours treated with sunitinib alone or in sunitinib/everolimus sequential combination as compared with vehicle or everolimus alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Necrotic areas in tumours treated with sunitinib monotherapy were increased by two-fold reaching 47.3% of the tumour area compared with 23.6% in the control-treated tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similar increase was observed in tumours treated with the alternated sequences of sunitinib and everolimus with necrosis reaching 43.7% of the tumour area. Taken individually, necrotic areas in the 1W, 2W, and 3W regimens reached 38.1%, 52.3%, and 40.6% of the tumour area, respectively. Treatment with everolimus alone did not induce significant changes in necrotic areas relative to control (27% <italic>vs</italic> 23.6%), suggesting that in all regimens, necrosis was a consequence of sunitinib administration.</p>
        <p>Staining with anti-CA-IX antibodies was performed to assess occurrence of hypoxia within treated tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). The CA-IX expression is often regarded as a surrogate marker for HIF expression; the latter being a very unstable biomarker that could be technically difficult to evaluate using immunohistochemistry. Basal CA-IX staining covered 57.7% of the surface of control tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Sunitinib both as a single agent and in sequential regimens increased the hypoxic area to 69.5% and 76.1% of the tumour area, respectively. In the 1W, 2W, and 3W regimens, hypoxic areas increased to 68.4%, 84.1%, and 75.9% of the tumour area, respectively. In contrast, everolimus alone did not induce significant increase hypoxic areas compared with control (62.7% <italic>vs</italic> 57.7%). As for necrosis, increase in hypoxic areas seemed dependent on sunitinib administration rather than everolimus.</p>

        <title>Angiogenesis and mTOR pathway variations according to tumour response</title>
        <p>We observed two main tumour behaviours that may characterise the sensitivity to the different treatments: (i) ST tumour control, that is, partial response followed by tumour volume stabilisation, and (ii) tumour PG, that is, tumour volume stabilisation followed by quick disease progression (see Materials and methods). The distribution of mice into the two groups of response was as followed. Forty percent of the tumours were characterised by ST tumour control in the sunitinib (<italic>n</italic>=2/5), everolimus (<italic>n</italic>=2/5), and sunitinib/everolimus treatment groups (<italic>n</italic>=6/15) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Slight differences were observed within the alternated regimens, with 40%, 20%, and 60% of ST tumours in the 1W (<italic>n</italic>=2/5), 2W (<italic>n</italic>=1/5), and 3W (<italic>n</italic>=3/5) regimens, respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). As expression of HIF in our model is not constitutively driven by VHL mutation, changes in tumour angiogenesis and mTOR pathways are considered as potentially adaptive mechanisms in response to the stress induced by sunitinib and everolimus. Vessel numbers and vascular lumen areas were reduced by 2.5–4-fold in all the treatment groups compared with control, reflecting a strong antiangiogenic effect. This effect was independent of the progression status of the tumours with the exception of tumours controlled by sunitinib alone, which were characterised by reduced vascular lumen area and increased necrosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>We then assessed the expression of the pS6, a downstream target of mTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) in all groups of tumours. In controlled tumours, pS6 expression was significantly decreased compared with the pS6 expression in progressive tumours, except for tumours that were treated with sunitinib as a single agent. Everolimus alone, 1W, 2W, and 3W regimens reduced pS6 expression by 60%, 38%, 70%, and 27%, respectively, in controlled tumours as compared with progressive tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Of note, pS6 expression in progressive tumours was decreased in 2 and 3W groups compared with the other regimens (control, 1W, sunitinib, and everolimus monotherapy) indicating a more efficient downregulation of the mTOR pathway with those two sequential combinations. In conclusion, tumours controlled by the treatment were characterised by reduced angiogenesis and mTOR pathway inhibition, whereas progressive—that is, resistant—tumours were characterised by sustained mTOR pathway activity.</p>

        <title>Lack of response to targeted therapy and mesenchymal differentiation</title>
        <p>Drug-induced hypoxia in tumours may trigger survival pathways among which epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) seems to have a major role. Furthermore, as both angiogenesis and mTOR pathway inhibition may affect cellular differentiation, we evaluated vimentin and E-cadherin expression in tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In the vehicle-treated group, tumours expressed both vimentin (53.9% of the tumour area) and E-cadherin (35.7%) displaying a mixed phenotype with a vimentin/E-cadherin ratio of 1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In all treatment groups, controlled tumours displayed a decrease in vimentin expression by 73% and 79% when treated by sunitinib and everolimus as single agents, respectively, and by 33% when considering all alternated sequences as a single group. In details, tumour sustainably controlled by 1W, 2W, and 3W regimens were characterised by a reduction in vimentin expression of 42%, 46%, and 31%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, E-cadherin expression increased by 93% in the sunitinib monotherapy group and by 33% in the alternated sequence groups with some differences among regimens. For instance, controlled tumours in the 2W and 3W groups displayed 70% and 54% increase in E-cadherin expression, respectively, whereas tumours treated in the 1W regimen displayed a 38% reduction in E-cadherin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Similar to the 1W regimen, controlled tumours in the everolimus monotherapy group displayed a 10% decrease in E-cadherin expression. Despite these differences among the treatment groups, the ratio of vimentin/E-cadherin expression decreased in all groups compared with the vehicle-treated tumours, suggesting epithelial differentiation when tumours are controlled by the treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Conversely, in most progressive tumours the proportion of vimentin-positive surface did not change, except a slight decrease in the sunitinib monotherapy group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Three treatment groups displayed reduced E-cadherin expression among progressive tumours compared with control-treated tumours (sunitinib monotherapy, 2 and 3W regimens), whereas two treatment groups displayed a modest increase (everolimus monotherapy and 1W regimen) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). As a consequence, in these progressive tumours the vimentin/E-cadherin ratio increased in three groups (sunitinib monotherapy, 2 and 3W regimens) and slightly decreased in two other groups (everolimus monotherapy and 1W regimen) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results suggested that progressive tumours under treatment tend to exacerbate a mesenchymal differentiation, especially in the sunitinib monotherapy subgroup, whereas tumours sustainably controlled retain more epithelial phenotypes.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Sunitinib and everolimus are both approved for the treatment of advanced RCC in first-line and second-line therapy, respectively. In most patients, the switch from first-line treatment with TKI to second-line everolimus is made upon occurrence of documented development of tumour PG. Sunitinib is regarded as an antiangiogenic agent inducing vascular disruption, hypoxia, and tumour necrosis. Either as a consequence of pharmacological mechanisms or as a result of constitutively activated hypoxia pathways in the tumour, some clinical data and data from animal models have also suggested that the development of resistance was associated with a more aggressive phenotype. Consequently, attempts have been made to counteract acquired resistance to sunitinib and clinical trials have been developed aiming to switch between active compounds displaying distinct mechanisms of action before the occurrence of acquired resistance.</p>
      <p>The aim of our study was to look at changes in human tumours exposed to sequential administration of sunitinib and everolimus to provide information that could serve for clinical trials aiming at delaying tumour PG in RCC patients. In our study, we tested three different sequences of sunitinib and everolimus consisting of every week (1W), every 2 weeks (2W), and every 3 weeks (3W) alternation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Although the small number of animals limits statistics in terms of TTP in this study, all evaluated sequences yielded longer mTTP than sunitinib and everolimus given as a continuous daily dosing as single agents. This observation supports the hypothesis that treatment alternations before progression could postpone the emergence of tumour PG. In our study, single agent sunitinib yielded shorter mTTP compared with everolimus monotherapy (36 days <italic>vs</italic> 50 days). Similar observations were made <italic>in vivo</italic> in other models showing increased median survival of mice treated by everolimus first line compared with sunitinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rosa <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, this trend was not observed in clinical trials in which median PFS for first-line sunitinib was consistently superior to everolimus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Motzer <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2013</xref>).</p>
      <p>Recent data from literature highlighted the possible correlation between EMT and sunitinib resistance in ccRCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hammers <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). Interestingly in a mammary epithelial cells model, the inhibition of mTOR pathway was found to activate EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mikaelian <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). In our study, tumours treated with everolimus in monotherapy or in alternated sequential regimens displayed a higher level of vimentin expression than tumours treated with sunitinib alone consistent with the observation that everolimus may induce mesenchymal differentiation. Interestingly, the ratio of vimentin over E-cadherin expression was different in the alternative sequences compared with monotherapies. This suggests that the tumour cell biology responded differently to alternations of drugs than to continuous exposure to the same inhibitor.</p>
      <p>Sequential regimens were all efficient in inhibiting angiogenesis as determined by reduction in the number of tumour vessels and tumour vascular areas. Interestingly, as shown earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lane <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), angiogenesis inhibition by sunitinib and everolimus proceeded from different mechanisms as neither hypoxia nor necrosis was involved in tumours treated by everolimus alone. In addition, only mice treated with sunitinib monotherapy presented controlled tumours characterised by lower vessel size compared with progressive tumours. In fact, it has been suggested that everolimus was more efficient on mature vessels than sunitinib that mainly affected unstable neoangiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lane <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). Alternate combinations of sunitinib and everolimus may thus target both immature and mature vessels, increasing antiangiogenic activity. New studies are questioning the use of early switch to everolimus after first-line TKI failure instead of a prolonged TKI exposure in second line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Calvani <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). However, looking at TTP and pS6 inhibition, our data suggested that everolimus remained efficient in a sequential combination strategy in which early switches are done before progression. The degree of pS6 inhibition was even increased in the sequential combination strategy compared with everolimus monotherapy. This may be explained by the fact that programmed switches between everolimus and sunitinib could delay the occurrence of mechanisms associated with drug resistance, such as the induction of AKT activation by a negative feedback loop upon mTOR inhibition that has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">O'Reilly <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>How alternate sequences of sunitinib and everolimus translate into clinical setting remains difficult to evaluate in the absence of specific clinical trial. In the RECORD-3 study comparing sunitinib until progression followed by everolimus <italic>vs</italic> the reverse sequence, the investigators showed that sunitinib first line followed by everolimus was superior to everolimus first line followed by sunitinib in terms of first-line PFS and overall survival. However, as &gt;50% of patients were unable to cross over, it remains difficult to compare second-line with first-line median PFS. However, in the RECORD-1 trial comparing everolimus to placebo after sunitinib or sorafenib failure, median PFS was 4.9 months, which represent ∼50% of first-line median PFS of 10.7 months, assuming a cross trial comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Motzer <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2008</xref>). In our mice trial, the median TTP was 59 days for the alternated sequences of treatment, which represent a 64% increased compared with the mTTP of sunitinib. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rosa <italic>et al</italic> (2013)</xref> recently published a study observing the impact of everolimus after 5 weeks of sunitinib treatment and demonstrated that the addition of everolimus slowed down tumour growth compared with sunitinib monotherapy . In their study, they also report a 60% increase in overall survival for the sequential treatment over monotherapy (97 <italic>vs</italic> 61 days). All together, these data suggest that a programmed sequential strategy giving sunitinib and everolimus without waiting for progression may be considered as a potential option for designing clinical trials in patients with advanced RCC. In fact, using TKI or everolimus often induce transient toxicities that could be clinically limiting or unbearable for patients leading to therapeutic interruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Molina <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). In this study, no significant weight loss or changes in animal behaviour was observed in mice treated with alternate sequences, indicating no toxicity of these treatments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p>
      <p>In summary, the use of a sequential combination strategy using alternate treatments with sunitinib and everolimus may be an interesting approach to control tumour PG and postpone the emergence of resistance mechanisms such as the EMT. At least three clinical trials are underway evaluating alternate sequence of sunitinib and everolimus or temsirolimus in patients with advanced RCC (ANZUP 0901, NCT01784978 and NCT01517243).</p>

          <title>Background:</title>
          <p>Invasion of the surrounding tissue is part of the metastatic cascade. Here, we examined the invasion of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells into the mesothelial barrier and identified the related microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods:</title>
          <p>The interactions between PDAC cells and mesothelial monolayers were characterised and quantified using a specific time-lapse videomicroscopy assay. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells were further evaluated using the adhesion assay, and miRNA, mRNA and protein expressions were determined using microarray, q-RT–PCR and western blots, respectively. These data were correlated with <italic>in vivo</italic> dissemination scores.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results:</title>
          <p>Two groups of PDAC cell lines were distinguished by their integration capacity into the mesothelial monolayer using mean elongation factors (MEFs). Adhesion assays showed a concordant relation between adhesive properties and integration capacity. The distant metastases scores were reverse correlated with MEFs. Microarray analysis of these groups revealed that miR-23a and/or miR-24 target for FZD5, HNF1B and/or TMEM92, respectively, and that they are significantly deregulated.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions:</title>
          <p>MiR-23a and/or miR-24 overexpression leads to gene silencing of FZD5, TMEM92 and/or HNF1B. Their downregulation induces deregulated expression and degradation of E-cadherin and <italic>β</italic>-catenin causing destabilisation of the cadherin/catenin complex, and altered the expression of Wnt-related genes. We propose a molecular (epi)genetic mechanism by which increased EMT-like cell shape transformation and integration into mesothelial monolayers of PDAC cells can be observed.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Approximately 3% of all new cancer cases in the United States of America are caused by pancreatic malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Siegel <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). The median survival time of all patients accounts for 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sohn <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jang <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p>
    <p>In spite of intensive efforts in basic research and advances in clinical management, the high mortality rate has not been improved significantly in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jemal <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). A main cause of persisting mortality is the cancer's early dissemination, which is often in the form of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Further investigation of the mechanisms underlying pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell dissemination may identify novel therapeutic targets, and provide a basis for increased survival of treatment strategies.</p>
    <p>Expression of the adhesion molecule E-cadherin is a key factor for cell dissemination in many settings, ranging from embryogenesis to metastasis. Gain or loss of E-cadherin expression and the ensuing abrogation or maintenance of intercellular adherens junctions leads to EMT (epithelial–mesenchymal transition) or its reverse mechanism MET (mesenchymal–epithelial transition). Loss of E-cadherin results in EMT and allows cells to detach from cell agglomerations and to migrate. The morphological correlate manifests as loss of cell polarity towards spindle-shaped transformation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Thiery, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Thiery <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lim and Thiery, 2012</xref>).</p>
    <p>In the past two decades, epigenetic alterations have been recognised as crucial elements of the genesis of many carcinomas, including PDAC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Suter <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">McCleary-Wheeler <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Gene silencing by microRNAs (miRNAs) is an epigenetic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bushati and Cohen, 2007</xref>) that has an important role in the development of pancreatic malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bloomston <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Szafranska <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
    <p>Phenotype investigation, that is, microscopic investigation, of the development of peritoneal carcinomatosis in combination with correlated miRNA expression profiles could lead to a better understanding of the dissemination process.</p>
    <p>We hypothesised that the ability to metastasise relies on successful invasion of the surrounding tissue, and that this process is bound to miRNA deregulation. To identify relevant miRNAs, we investigated the dissemination of PDAC cells via migration and adhesion assays and correlated these findings with miRNA expression profiles.</p>

        <p>Fifteen established human PDAC cell lines (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were investigated and maintained as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mees <italic>et al</italic> (2010)</xref>.</p>

        <title>Cell culture: human mesothelial cells</title>
        <p>After obtaining written consent, specimens of the greater omentum were obtained from patients undergoing abdominal surgery for reasons other than malignancy or acute/chronic inflammatory diseases. Specimens (1 mm<sup>3</sup>) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 1% collagenase II solution (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood Township, NJ, USA).</p>
        <p>The resuspended human mesothelial cells (HMCs) were cultivated in Medium 199 (PAA Laboratory GmbH, Pasching, Austria) in fibronectin- (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) coated tissue dishes. Monolayers were confluent after ∼7 days of growth and then introduced into assays.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Migration assay</title>
        <p>We added suspended and stained (Cell-Tracker-Red; Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) PDAC cells on a confluent HMC monolayer, which is stained with the fluorescence dye Cell-Tracker-Green (Invitrogen).</p>
        <p>Over a 6-h time period, pictures were taken every 4 min to produce a time-lapse video clip using the Eclipse TE2000U inverted microscope (Nikon, Düsseldorf, Germany) at × 100 magnification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Data</xref>).</p>
        <p>In areas with &lt;30 evaluable PDAC cells, abnormal cell accumulation or inconsistent HMC monolayers were excluded from examination. The peripheral cells were also disregarded and excluded from further examination. The Nikon Imaging software Advanced Research 3.1 (Nikon, Düsseldorf, Germany; NIS AR Version 3.1) was used for recording and quantitative examination. Cell shape transformation was quantified by calculating the extent of elongation using the following formula:</p>
        <p>Elongation factor (EF)=maxFeret/minFeret (NIS AR 3.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>)</p>
        <p>where Feret's diameter is the distance between two parallel lines restricting the object perpendicular to its specified direction and max/minFeret is the maximal/minimal Feret's diameter of an object. EF=1 is equivalent to a circle; the higher the EF value, the more elongated the investigated shape.</p>
        <p>Of each time-lapse video clips, seven frames at intervals of 60 min were analysed, starting with frame number one at 0 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
        <sec>
          <title>Statistics</title>
          <p>The cell lines were divided into three groups according to their mean elongation capacity (mean EFs as MEF classification) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Cell lines falling into the intermediate group were disregarded and excluded from further investigations.</p>

        <title>Adhesion assay</title>
        <p>Human mesothelial cells were plated on fibronectin- (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) coated microtiter plates (96 wells; Greiner BioOne, Frickenhausen, Germany) and cultivated till confluent monolayers were achieved. Adhesion properties of AM-Calcein (Invitrogen)-labelled PDAC cells were determined every 10 min for 90 min by measuring the fluorescence intensity. Background autofluorescence induced by the genuine PDAC cells and HMCs served as negative controls. Negative and positive controls (total load) were conducted routinely. Measurements were conducted in triplicates and repeated at least two times in independent experiments.</p>
        <sec>
          <title>Statistics</title>
          <p>For statistical analysis, background autofluorescence was subtracted from the recorded values and the relative adhesion properties were calculated by the ratio related to the positive control. The normalised relative adhesion potentials of the two groups were compared using the unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test for each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p>

        <title>Correlation of the MEF classification and dissemination scores</title>
        <p>Our group has previously published dissemination scores for the cell lines used in the orthotopic mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mees <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). These scores were then used for the present study.</p>
        <p>Mean EFs for each cell line were plotted against the score of the total dissemination score and the distant metastases score, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A and B</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Microarray analysis</title>
        <p>RNA isolation was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using the RNeasy Mini-Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for mRNA and miRNeasy Mini-Kit for miRNA (Qiagen). The prepared RNA was preserved at −80 °C. Only samples with RNA integrity number &gt;8.8 for miRNA and &gt;8.7 for mRNA were accepted for further processing.</p>
        <p>Array analyses were performed using RNA 6000 Nano LabChipVR reagent set (Agilent Technologies, Boeblingen, Germany), Low RNA Input Linear Amplification Kit PLUS, One-Color (Agilent Technologies), Gene Expression Hybridisation Kit (Agilent) and miRNA Labelling Reagent and Hybridisation Kit (Agilent Technologies).</p>
        <p>The Microarray Scanner G2505B (Agilent Technologies) was used for washing and scanning of miRNA and mRNA arrays.</p>
        <sec>
          <title>Statistics</title>
          <p>Statistical and bioinformatical analysis of microarray data from mRNA and miRNA microarrays were performed using the GeneSpring GX Software Version 12.0 (Agilent Technologies).</p>
          <p>Non-biological influences and systemic variation were corrected using a normalisation algorithm. First, false-positive values due to background signals were excluded by setting a threshold of raw signals to 1.0 and by transforming them to the logarithm base two (log<sub>2</sub>(1)=0). Second, to avoid systemic biases of the individual array chips, a percentile shift was implemented to adjust all spot intensities. The 75th percentile was used for mRNA microarray and the 90th percentile was used for miRNA microarray. Additionally, the normalised mRNA data was subjected to baseline transformation (baseline corresponds to the median of all samples) to identify similar expression profiles more easily.</p>
          <p>Cell lines were separated into two groups according to the MEF classification, which were evolved from the migration assay results. (HPaf and Suit007 had already been excluded after the migration assay. Capan-2 had to be excluded from further microarray analysis because of insufficient reproducibility.) Normalised data was averaged into groups. RNAs with a sufficient fluorescence signal in at least one of the analysed cell lines were displayed in a profile plot corresponding to the two provided groups and were analysed further. All miRNAs/mRNAs passed two steps of filtering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The first filter was based on an acceptable fluorescence signal of all values in one of the two compared groups (flag filtering). The second filter excluded non-changing genes with a normalised signal intensity value in a range from 0.5 to −0.5 of all values in both groups (filter by expression). A moderated <italic>t</italic>-test corrected by Westfall–Young permutation and the fold change analysis were used for statistical analysis. Entities with satisfying <italic>P</italic>-values (cutoff <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) as well as fold changes (cutoff FC ⩾1.8 for miRNA and FC ⩾2.0 for mRNA, respectively) identified significantly deregulated miRNAs/mRNAs. These differently regulated miRNAs/mRNAs were clustered hierarchically in a two-dimensional dendrogram corresponding to their distance metric values (uncentred Pearson's correlation) generated by the average-linked correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). MiRNA microarray analysis was completed by searching the TargetScan database for mRNAs, which were targeted by the differently regulated miRNAs.</p>
          <p>Finally, an overlap of the potential miRNA targets and the significantly deregulated mRNA entities was executed (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

        <p>Initially, all PDAC cells showed nearly round shapes with an average EF of 1.13±0.03 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). During examination, about half of the cell lines elongated, whereas the other half kept their primary shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Data</xref>).</p>
        <p>The cell elongation was quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and the MEF observed in every cell line was determined using seven standardised time-lapse frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The MEFs ranged from MEF<sub>Su8686</sub> 1.12±0.11 to MEF<sub>Patu8988T</sub> 2.05±1.15 and were subsequently used to classify the PDAC cell lines into two groups (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). According to this MEF classification, group A cell lines showed a major elongation capacity of PDAC cells with an average MEF of 1.66±0.2, which is significantly increased (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) compared with the initial MEFs and the MEFs of PDAC cells in group B (1.18±0.05). The overall average MEF for all cell lines for all time points was 1.36±0.03. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells of two cell lines (HPaf MEF 1.34±0.44 and Suit 007 MEF 1.38±0.45) showed an intermediate elongation capacity using a modified median split and were excluded from further investigations.</p>

        <p>With regard to the adhesive capacity of PDAC cell lines, we compared group A (major elongation capacity) results with group B cell lines (minor elongation capacity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Using the unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test for statistical analysis, group A showed significantly increased adhesion (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01–0.05) at every single time point, as well as on an average throughout the observation period. Adhesion potency of group A ranged between 0.48±0.08 and 0.73±0.09 with an average of 0.68±0.10. The adhesion potency of group B was less (0.36±0.07) and ranged from 0.28±0.05 to 0.39+0.07.</p>

        <title>Correlation of the MEF classification and dissemination scores</title>
        <p>For assessment and comparison of cell elongation with dissemination properties, we used dissemination scores previously published by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mees <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). The score of total metastatic formation as well as its subgroup of distant metastatic formation were used. Total metastatic formation includes lymph nodes, whereas distant metastatic formation is mainly determined by liver metastases. Cellular elongation showed moderate relationship to distant metastasis scores, whereas correlation between the score of total metastatic formation and MEF values was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Comparing the MEFs of both groups with their potential for distant metastasis formation, group A cell lines (high MEFs) were found in low metastatic cell lines, whereas high metastatic cell lines showed significantly lower MEF values (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Microarray analysis</title>
        <p>mRNA and miRNA expression profiles of the above-defined groups (MEF classification) were determined using microarray analysis to detect gene and miRNA expression differences as a potential rationale for the observed differing cell behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Further, investigated miRNAs and mRNAs were validated by quantitative rRT–PCR and the corresponding protein expression was determined by western blot.</p>
        <p>Five miRNAs (hsa-miR-23a, hsa-miR-24, hsa-miR-638, hsa-miR-572 and ebv-miR-BART13) were upregulated and one miRNA (hsa-miR-296) was downregulated in group A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>, right). The following analysis of the TargetScan database identified 1146 gene targets influenced by the expression of these six miRNAs.</p>
        <p>Seven mRNAs were significantly upregulated and 21 mRNAs were downregulated in group A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>, left).</p>
        <p>One thousand one hundred and sixty-four mRNAs were identified as potential targets for the six deregulated miRNAs. Three mRNAs overlap between the potential miRNA targets and the observed deregulated mRNAs: FZD5, TMEM92 and HNF1B. Two of the six deregulated miRNAs (hsa-miR-23a and hsa-miR-24) are reported to target the three overlapping mRNAs (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>

        <p>E-cadherin and <italic>β</italic>-catenin protein expression in both groups was compared by western blot. Group A cell lines displayed a significantly reduced protein expression of E-cadherin and <italic>β</italic>-catenin compared with group B cell lines (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). For E-cadherin, densitometric quantification showed relative grey intensities of 0.1269±0.1973 for group A and of 8.6483±6.5454 group B. For <italic>β</italic>-catenin, densitometric quantification showed relative grey intensities of 0.8234±0.5187 for group A and of 3.6340±2.1762 group B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A and B</xref>). Western blot of TMEM92 and HNF1B did not show different protein amounts in both groups (not shown), but for FZD5 a significant electrophoretic shift towards slower mobility was observed in group B <italic>vs</italic> group A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We implemented a novel migration assay for PDAC cells at HMC monolayers to analyse the peritoneal metastasis formation. Instead of the expected general transmigration, all PDAC cells exhibited a specific migration pattern and were almost exclusively found at cell–cell boundaries of the epithelial monolayers. During this process, several cell lines underwent EMT typical morphological changes, such as the development of an elongated shape from an initial round cell shape. Cell elongation appeared to be a significant process during PDAC peritoneal metastasis, and we thus classified the investigated cell lines according to their exhibited elongation (MEF classification).</p>
      <p>Besides quantitative analysis via MEF classification, the qualitative observation of the elongation suggested that PDAC cells were influenced by <italic>de novo</italic> intercellular adhesion with the HMCs.</p>
      <p>To discriminate between EMT- and adhesion-associated effects, the adhesion potency and velocity of the PDAC cell lines were compared: the significantly more elongated cell lines of group A showed significantly higher adhesion properties than the more round group B cell lines (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). This result underlines the relevant influence of HMC shape adaption by adhesion and appears to be contradictory. It is possible that the observed cell adhesion characteristics reflect beginning of the reversal of EMT, that is, MET induced by HMC contacts. However, the migrating PDAC cells remained spindle shaped even within an extended observation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) challenging this assumption.</p>
      <p>Thus, it appears that the integrating PDAC cells could have been influenced by <italic>de novo</italic> intercellular adhesion with the HMCs, independent of E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Thiery, 2002</xref>), or, more likely, during interactions with HMCs, the integrating PDAC cells can modulate the availability of E-cadherin using the identified targets FZD5, HNF1B and <italic>TMEM</italic> via miR23a/miR24 deregulation.</p>
      <p>In summary, the present results indicate that the development of PDAC peritoneal carcinomatosis is characterised by integration into HMC monolayers rather than by transmigration. Different PDAC cell lines exhibited varying ability to integrate into the monolayer of the mesothelium. The disposition to integrate could be advantageous for cell survival and for the development of peritoneal dissemination and consequently could lead to more metastatic phenotypes.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, integration properties of PDAC cells into HMC monolayers inversely correlated with the previously reported extent of distant metastasis formation, mainly determined by liver colonisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mees <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>). The contradicting correlations between liver colonisation and peritoneal metastasis model data suggest organ-specific involvement of epigenetic regulations in cancer progression. This is likely determined by microenvironmental factors such as HMCs <italic>vs</italic> liver sinusoidal cells.</p>
      <p>We hypothesised that epigenetic mechanisms have a role not only for the pancreatic cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bloomston <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) but also for its organ-specific dissemination process. Cell lines with major elongation capacity (group A, MEF 1.66±0.2) showed higher expression levels of miR-23a (2.4-fold) and miR-24 (2.2-fold) than cell lines with minor integration capacity (group B, MEF 1.18±0.05). Additionally, group A cell lines exhibited lower expression of their target proteins FZD5, TMEM92 and HNF1B.</p>
      <p>The expression of Wnt-related genes leads to cell shape changes toward elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown <italic>et al</italic>, 1986</xref>), and the canonical Wnt/<italic>β</italic>-catenin signalling cascade has been revealed to be deregulated in PDAC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zeng <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bu <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). <italic>β</italic>-Catenin, the central molecule of the Wnt/<italic>β</italic>-catenin pathway, connects it to the main intercellular adhesion mechanism, the cadherin/catenin complex. Deregulations of this complex are also known to occur in PDAC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Perl <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pryczynicz <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>Group B cell lines showed increased expression of E-cadherin and <italic>β</italic>-catenin in western blot analysis (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). These results support our theory of a misbalance of cadherin and catenin in group A cell lines, resulting in the loss of the stable cadherin/catenin complex and resulting in EMT-like cell lengthening. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Howard <italic>et al</italic> (2011)</xref> suggested that permanent interactions of intracellular <italic>β</italic>-catenin rather than its absolute amount seem to facilitate EMT, which could serve as an explanation for the limited absolute difference in our analysis.</p>
      <p>Similarly, our microarray results showed an overall decreased expression of E-cadherin in group A cell lines, which however remained below the threshold for significance (5.08-fold increased expression in group B after altered algorithm (without the correction by Westfall–Young permutation)) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Data</xref>).</p>
      <p>The present data suggest that each of the three deregulated targets (FZD5, TMEM92 and HNF1B) – independently or in combination – could influence the two highly connected EMT-related systems: the canonical Wnt/<italic>β</italic>-catenin pathway and the intercellular adhesion process by the cadherin/catenin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the Frizzled family, FZD5 is one of eleven known receptor proteins (FZD1-10, SMO). These seven-pass transmembrane receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vinson <italic>et al</italic>, 1989</xref>) are indispensable to the activation of the canonical Wnt/<italic>β</italic>-catenin signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhanot <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). For the FZD5 electrophoretic mobility shift, likely due to serine phosphorylation, regulatory consequences are uncertain.</p>
      <p>Although correlations between HNF1B and the Wnt/<italic>β</italic>-catenin pathway were not observed, HNF1B serves as a positive transcription factor for E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goomer <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>).</p>
      <p>TMEM92 could act as an adaptor for E3 ubiquitin ligases and could support the degradation process of <italic>β</italic>-catenin and E-cadherin. In contrast, TMEM92 could also act as a competitive binding partner of the E3 ubiquitin ligase and also inhibit the ubiquitination and the following degradation of both <italic>β</italic>-catenin and E-cadherin, which appears to be more likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Konstas <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). Further, TMEM92 could act variably depending on its substrates. Thus, the quality of this interaction remains unclear and the consequences of TMEM92 deregulation are currently unknown, but gene silencing of TMEM92 by the upregulation of miR-24 appears to increase the degradation of <italic>β</italic>-catenin as well as that of E-cadherin.</p>
      <p>Our explanatory model presents complex, fragile and instable molecular mechanisms with an epigenetic background followed by EMT-like cell shape transformation as observed in the time-lapse microscopy. We theorise that the disequilibrium of miR-23a and/or miR-24 is at its basis. <italic>In silico</italic> pathway analysis supported by mRNA and protein expression data delivers an explanation for how the miRNA-mediated downregulation of FZD5, TMEM92 and HNF1B could influence the canonical Wnt/<italic>β</italic>-catenin pathway and the intercellular adhesion mediated by the cadherin/catenin Complex. This influence could be exerted by the deregulated expression and/or degradation of the two key components <italic>β</italic>-catenin and E-cadherin.</p>
      <p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report correlating the Wnt/<italic>β</italic>-catenin pathway or the cadherin/catenin complex with the peritoneal dissemination of PDAC. At the same time, peritoneal dissemination seems to be an organ-specific form of metastasis formation that differs from other host organ sites.</p>
      <p>Taken together, the unexpected PDAC cell elongation during mesothelial invasion seems to be the product of coincidental loss and acquisition of intercellular adhesion between PDAC cells and the HMCs. This coincidence is likely caused by deregulation of the sensitive interaction between the cadherin/catenin Complex and the Wnt/<italic>β</italic>-catenin pathway. The immediate microenvironment of the PDAC cells produced by the HMCs may trigger this deregulation.</p>

        <p><bold>Sequences of different integration patterns.</bold> Suspended PDAC cells were stained with Cell-Tracker-Red (Invitrogen) and added to a confluent HMC monolayer, which is stained with Cell-Tracker-Green (Invitrogen). Fluorescence pictures using the appropriate wavelength and control pictures in low light intensity were obtained. The three pictures of the two sequences represent 0, 180 and 360 min examination time. The carcinoma cells are highlighted in red owing to the difficulty to identify them in motionless pictures when integrated into the HMC layer. These highlights were used as the basis for the partly automatic, partly manual morphometrical analyses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The upper sequence shows an example of the observed migration pattern of cell lines with PDAC cell elongation (Patu8902). Most carcinoma cells show round or nearly round shapes at the beginning (0 min). The following pictures of the series (180 and 360 min) illustrate the changes of most carcinoma cells toward an elongated shape and their integration into the mesothelial monolayer. The lower sequence illustrates the migration pattern of Su8686 exemplarily for cell lines without tendencies to elongate. Only marginal changing of the initial round cell shapes is observed over the entire examination time.</p>

        <p><bold>Molecular genetic model (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">van Roy and Berx, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pei and Grishin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Van den Bossche <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>)</bold>. This <italic>in silico</italic> model is highly simplified and points out the crucial essentials of our results. (Top, left; canonical Wnt/<italic>β</italic>-catenin pathway) The destruction complex Axin1 leads to the phosphorylation of <italic>β</italic>-catenin. Phosphorylated <italic>β</italic>-catenin is ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase and then degraded proteasomally (off-status). The activation of the two receptors FZD and LRP5 by Wnt leads to membrane recruitment of the destruction complex. The E3 ubiquitin ligase is no longer able to ubiquitinate <italic>β</italic>-catenin of membrane-associated Axin1 (on-status). Consequently, the cytoplasmatic amount of <italic>β</italic>-catenin increases. MiR-23a and miR-24 lead to the downregulation of FZD5. Subsequently, Wnt cannot adhere to its receptors, the signal transduction is precluded and the Wnt/<italic>β</italic>-catenin signalling pathway remains in its off-status. In this case, the <italic>β</italic>-catenin phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation take place without any regulatory inhibition. The cytoplasmatic <italic>β</italic>-catenin amount decreases. Consequently, two inverse effects seem to occur. First, the lack of cytoplasmatic <italic>β</italic>-catenin could result in the destabilisation of catenation between the cadherin–catenin complex and the actin cytoskeleton. This could be responsible for the observed loss of cell polarity in the cell lines of group A. Second, an increase of cytoplasmatic <italic>β</italic>-catenin leads to an increase of nuclear <italic>β</italic>-catenin as well. <italic>β</italic>eta-catenin bound to TCF/LEF acts as a negative transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jamora <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). It suppresses the expression of E-cadherin. Subsequently, the decrease of <italic>β</italic>-catenin leads to an increased expression of E-cadherin. This function of <italic>β</italic>-catenin seems to be a compensatory long-term feedback mechanism to maximise the small amount of cytoplasmatic <italic>β</italic>-catenin trying to restabilise the connection between the CCC and the cytoskeleton. (Bottom, right) Further, this attempt of compensatory feedback mechanism could be abrogated by the simultaneous downregulation of HNF1B. The expression of E-cadherin is enhanced by HNF1B serving as a positive transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goomer <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>). Thus, our results emphasise that the upregulation of miR-24 leads to the downregulation of HNF1B followed by decreased expression of E-sadherin with the loss of cell polarity. (Top, right; CCC) The cadherin–catenin complex (CCC) forms homologous cell–cell adhesion. The CCC includes the stable membrane-associated <italic>β</italic>-catenin pool. The E3 ubiquitin ligase leads to the ubiquitination of E-cadherin. Previous to the following endosomal degradation of E-cadherin, <italic>β</italic>-catenin dissociates from E-cadherin. Subsequently, the cytoplasmatic pool of <italic>β</italic>-catenin increases. We suppose that, most likely, TMEM92 interacts competitively with the E3 ubiquitin ligase and stabilises the amount of the CCC. MiR-24 leads to the downregulation of TMEM92. Downregulated TMEM92 fails to block the E3 ubiquitin ligase. Consequently, E-cadherin degradation is increased. The amount of E-cadherin decreases, cytoplasmatic <italic>β</italic>-catenin increases after dissociation, and the CCC and intercellular adhesion are destabilised. Possibly, the increase of dissociated <italic>β</italic>-catenin is immediately intercepted, because the same mechanism leads to a decreased pool of cytoplasmatic <italic>β</italic>-catenin. By competitive binding, TMEM92 inhibits the E3 ubiquitin ligase and consequently blocks <italic>β</italic>-catenin degradation. Thus, the gene silencing of TMEM92 by the upregulation of miR-24 appears to increase the degradation of <italic>β</italic>-catenin as well as E-cadherin. This mechanism also leads to the destabilisation of the CCC.</p>

          <title>Background:</title>
          <p>Treatment planning of localised prostate cancer remains challenging. Besides conventional parameters, a wealth of prognostic biomarkers has been proposed so far. None of which, however, have successfully been implemented in a routine setting so far. The aim of our study was to systematically verify a set of published prognostic markers for prostate cancer.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods:</title>
          <p>Following an in-depth PubMed search, 28 markers were selected that have been proposed as multivariate prognostic markers for primary prostate cancer. Their prognostic validity was examined in a radical prostatectomy cohort of 238 patients with a median follow-up of 60 months and biochemical progression as endpoint of the analysis. Immunohistochemical evaluation was performed using previously published cut-off values, but allowing for optimisation if necessary. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression were used to determine the prognostic value of biomarkers included in this study.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results:</title>
          <p>Despite the application of various cut-offs in the analysis, only four (14%) markers were verified as independently prognostic (AKT1, stromal AR, EZH2, and PSMA) for PSA relapse following radical prostatectomy.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions:</title>
          <p>Apparently, many immunohistochemistry-based studies on prognostic markers seem to be over-optimistic. Codes of best practice, such as the REMARK guidelines, may facilitate the performance of conclusive and transparent future studies.</p>

  <body>
    <p>The risk assessment and management of therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer are presently still mainly based on clinical criteria, for example, patient characteristics, clinical stage, serum PSA, and histopathological features, in particular, tumour extent and Gleason score. However, not all low-grade prostate cancers with a Gleason score less than 7 follow an indolent course, and carcinomas with a Gleason score of 7 or higher, on the other hand, may (rarely) present with a rather favourable clinical behaviour. These discrepancies have become increasingly apparent, particularly following the updated recommendations of the 2005 ISUP Gleason System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harlan <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), therefore emphasising the pressing need for additional molecular prognostic markers. Interestingly, the lack of reliable molecular biomarkers for the risk assessment of prostate cancer stands in sharp contrast to an ever-emerging number of proposed marker candidates. With nearly 2900 PubMed hits for the search term ‘prostate cancer prognostic marker' (July 2014), no evidently relevant prognostic biomarker has made its way into clinical practise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kristiansen, 2012</xref>). This issue clearly stresses the necessity to reflect on the validity of biomarkers and biomarker development or even some aspects of our scientific publication culture.</p>
    <p>Despite the limitation of immunohistochemistry being an only semiquantitative technique, it still represents an essential methodological approach for a large fraction of published biomarker studies. This prompted us to experimentally verify the prognostic value of a wider range of previously published immunohistochemical prognostic markers for prostate cancer in a representative monocentric cohort of radical prostatectomy patients.</p>

        <title>Criteria for identification of prognostic markers</title>
        <p>In a first step, prognostic markers for prostate cancer were identified in a PubMed search (‘prostate cancer prognostic/prognosis immunohistochemistry'). Eligibility criteria for study inclusion were: (i) cohort size—a number of patients &gt;50 in studies using conventional slides or &gt;100 for tissue microarray (TMA)-based studies, (ii) multivariate prognostic value demonstrated in Cox analysis (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05), and (iii) conclusive immunohistochemistry protocol and antibody availability. From the pool of resulting candidates, we obtained 28 markers for validation.</p>

        <title>Prostate cancer cohort for validation</title>
        <p>The cohort consisted of 238 patients having undergone radical prostatectomy for treatment of primary prostate cancer between 1999 and 2006 and for which follow-up data were available. This cohort was compiled as a TMA as described previously, all tumours were reviewed and graded according to the ISUP 2005 recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerhardt <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mortezavi <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beer <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerhardt <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Follow-up data were obtained from review of patients' medical records. Median follow-up time for all patients was 60 months (mean 55 months). A biochemical recurrence, defined as a rising PSA level exceeding 0.1 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>, after having reached a nadir post surgery, occurred in 111 (46.6%) patients. Median time to PSA relapse was 25 months (interquartile range, 12–46 months); among men not experiencing progression, the median follow-up was 72 months (interquartile range, 60–96 months). In total, 13.4% of patients were lost to follow-up in the first 4 years.</p>
        <p>The median patient age was 64 years (range 46–75 years). The pT-category was pT2 in 152 patients (63.8%), pT3 in 76 patients (31.9%), and pT4 in 10 patients (4.3%). A total of 151 patients (63.4%) presented with complete surgical resection (R0 resection), whereas 84 patients (35.3%) had undergone a resection with positive margins (R1 resection). The Gleason score was &lt;7 in 45 patients (18.9%), equalled a total score of 7 in 133 patients (55.9%), and was &gt;7 in 60 patients (25.2%). Pre-operative PSA levels ranged from 0.39 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> to 357 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> (median 10.5 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>, no data were available for 11 patients). This study was approved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee of Zürich (approval number StV 25-2007).</p>

        <p>Automated immunohistochemical staining was carried out on one of the two technical platforms (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA/Leica Microsystems, Melbourne, Australia). If possible, antibodies were selected according to the preceding publications.

        <title>Evaluation of immunoreactivity</title>
        <p>Immunohistochemical slides were evaluated and scored by a single observer (FH) after instruction and supervision of an experienced genito-urinary pathologist (GK). Wherever possible, we adopted the scoring system described in the original publications of the respective markers. Technical details of scoring (localisation, evaluated feature, and scoring scale) are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>.</p>

        <title>Statistics</title>
        <p>SPSS 20 (IBM SPSS, Version 20.0, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for descriptive statistics. Further data analysis was performed using the R language for statistical computing, version 3.1.0. The statistical significance level was set at 0.05. To verify the prognostic value of the selected markers, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was applied. Multivariate Cox regression was performed with inclusion of the individual selected markers, Gleason score, log<sub>10</sub>(pre-OP PSA), dichotomous pT status (pT1/2 <italic>vs</italic> pT3/4), margins (R0 <italic>vs</italic> R1), and patient age. Additionally, markers were dichotomised using the web-based tool ‘cut off finder' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Budczies <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>) and were analysed using Kaplan–Meier estimates and log rank tests. A <italic>post hoc</italic> power analysis of the respective models was performed using the PASS 2008 software (NCSS, Kaysville, UT, USA).</p>

        <title>Characteristics of selected biomarker studies from the literature</title>
        <p>Of the markers matching our inclusion criteria, 27 candidates were selected, 3 of which (androgen receptor, oestrogen receptor-alpha and -beta) each yielded two data points (stromal and epithelial immunoreactivity), resulting in 30 biomarkers for further validation (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the originally published studies, cohorts had a median size of 225 patients (range 53–2724), the median follow-up time covered 5.0 years (range 1–12), and the median hazard ratio for disease progression of the reported biomarkers was 2.42 (range 1.1–7.69; values of markers with hazard ratios &lt;1 have been included as their reciprocal value). All selected biomarkers play a role in a broad spectrum of tumour-relevant processes including, for example, proliferation or apoptosis, cell cycle control, cell adhesion, or hormone signalling. Most studies (<italic>n</italic>=23) were based on radical prostatectomy (RPE) cohorts, four studies described watchful waiting cohorts, and one study described a mixed population (RPE and watchful waiting).</p>

        <title>Associations of biomarkers with clinico-pathological parameters</title>
        <p>The association of marker expression in prostate cancer with pT category, Gleason score, and pre-operative serum PSA was analysed in a Spearman rank correlation analysis. As expected for independent prognostic markers, most associations failed significance, even though some dependencies became apparent, particularly with Gleason score and serum PSA, but high correlation coefficients were not noted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Prognostic significance of putative prognostic biomarkers</title>
        <p>Initially, we conducted a <italic>post hoc</italic> power analysis and found that the available sample size of 238 analysable patients on the TMA would be sufficient to detect clinically relevant hazard ratios at a significance level of 0.05 and a power of almost 100% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Kaplan–Meier analyses identified 11 markers as being univariate significant factors: AR epithelial/stromal, CB1R, CRGA, E-Cadherin, EZH2, Ki-67, NFkB, p21, p27, and PSMA (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In univariate Cox analyses, only nine markers were found significant (nuclear and stromal AR, CB1R, CRGA, E-Cadherin, NFkB, p21, p27, and PSMA), CD10 was of borderline significance (<italic>P</italic>=0.051) and Ki-67 dropped out. Multivariate Cox regression, which was applied to analyse the prognostic value of the markers in combination with other prognostic factors, demonstrated significance for only the four markers AKT1, stromal AR, EZH2, and PSMA (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). A marker-wise comparison of published and verified multivariate prognostic value, illustrated by a forest plot, highlights these differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In three of the four confirmed prognostic markers, the verified hazard ratio was lower than originally reported; only for one (PSMA), a higher hazard ratio was found.</p>
        <p>To further analyse the prognostic values in the clinically relevant subgroup of tumours with Gleason scores of 6 or 7, another multivariate model was calculated (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In this tumour subgroup, again AKT1, stromal AR, and PSMA and additionally CB1R, CD10, E-Cadherin, and N-Cadherin were confirmed.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study is the first to systematically analyse and verify a larger set of proposed prognostic immunohistochemical markers for prostate cancer that have been demonstrated to be multivariate significant predictors for disease progression in previous studies. Although a series of quality criteria needed to be fulfilled to allow study inclusion, we were unable to confirm the majority of prognostic markers selected. Only 10 out of 28 markers (35%) could be verified in a univariate Cox approach and only 4 (14%) were subsequently confirmed as significant in a multivariate setting. According to these results, the loss of stromal androgen receptor expression was the biomarker with the most significant prognostic impact (hazard ratio 3.33); a finding that doubtlessly deserves further investigation. This rather remarkable discrepancy of published data and this study's results might be explained by either significant shortcomings of this verification study or general deficits in the publication culture concerning prognostic markers that may be either over-optimistic or too permissive.</p>
      <p>Concerning the former, great care was taken to minimise potential biases in the conduction of this study. The study cohort, which comprised 238 primary prostate cancer patients, is a well established, contemporary, monocentric prostatectomy cohort which has been extensively used in previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tischler <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerhardt <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mortezavi <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beer <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerhardt <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Although the number of patients may appear low at first sight, we want to point out, that it already exceeds the median cohort size of the studies re-analysed. Further, the application of study cases compiled as TMA does not only allow for a convenient high-throughput workflow but also serves as a model of biopsy-detected prostate cancer. In the present setup, each index tumour is represented by a single core. Even though this introduces a potential sampling bias and may compromise the analysis of highly heterogeneously expressed proteins, it also increases the likelihood to identify robust clinical prognostic markers, which ought to be detectable in a single core of a tumour-positive biopsy. Protocols for immunohistochemistry were adapted as closely to the original protocols as possible, and immunohistochemical staining was performed on standardised automated platforms that are also used for routine diagnostics at the Institute of Surgical Pathology of the University Hospital Zurich. To minimise interobserver variability, a single observer evaluated all slides. Our attitude towards statistical marker verification was deliberately benevolent, allowing for optimisation of cut-off values. Even when simplifying the multivariate model, excluding margins and patient age, the number of significantly prognostic biomarkers did not increase (data not shown). However, a caveat to the validity of the current study is that Ki-67, which is assumedly the best verified prognostic marker in prostate cancer, only showed a univariate significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kristiansen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fisher <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Admittedly, the composition of our study cohort may lead to a bias, with cases enriched for high-grade and high-stage tumours, leading to a relapse rate of 46%, which is approximately 15 percentage points above the usual rates of consecutive RPE cohorts. However, this acknowledged bias should be expected to ease the verification of biomarker candidates and is therefore considered useful in this studies' setting.</p>
      <p>The most apparent deficit of the original studies lies in their study design, which was generally based on a retrospective analysis of a single cohort. This type of analysis is prone to model overfitting and is nowadays increasingly regarded as only hypothesis-generating because the important validation is missing. A more appropriate approach includes an initial analysis of a training cohort to establish a test hypothesis and a cut-off value, which is then verified in an independent testing cohort. In a way, this study provides the necessary testing cohort for these studies, even though under considerably tightened conditions with probable differences in surgery, in the pre-analytic steps, the immunostaining protocols, and the analytical attitude of the observers in the interpretation of immunostainings. The impact of correct statistical handling in biomarker studies has long been recognised and has led to several recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McShane <italic>et al</italic>, 2005b</xref>), most importantly, the REMARK (‘REporting recommendations for tumor MARKer prognostic studies') guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Simon and Altman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayes <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altman, 1998</xref>). These provide a comprehensive description of quality criteria for prognostic biomarker studies but are still not widely accepted, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mallett <italic>et al</italic> (2010)</xref> recently demonstrated in a meta-analysis; an observation we can only confirm.</p>
      <p>An additional potential bias lies in the composition of the respective cohort under analysis, which may also influence biomarker performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braun <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). It remains unclear whether a biomarker that performs well in clinically detected populations shows similar performance in a contemporary PSA screen-detected cohort. Also, a possible influence of patient ethnicity cannot be excluded. Last but not least, the evolution of Gleason grading in the last decade (ISUP 2005) may introduce a significant bias and it is unclear which type of Gleason grading the individual studies were based on.</p>
      <p>A general deficit of most TMA-based studies is the missing demonstration of relevant construction bias. Ideally, a new TMA should be verified with a panel of established markers prior to the analysis of new candidates, and this confirmative data should be included in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> of the first publication. We further suggest publicising the immunohistochemistry raw data sets in order to allow re-analyses and insightful meta-analytic studies. This would allow for proper post-publication data review and would prospectively increase the quality of published papers. Even though high-quality journals demand the deposition of genomic data in centralised repositories, there is no widely acknowledged infrastructure for immunohistochemistry data. This may be partly due to the widespread notion of immunohistochemistry being a somewhat arbitrary technique yielding semiquantitative results. However, the growing number of immunohistochemistry-based biomarker studies indicates the necessity for better tools to increase their quality and to allow for a better comparison of the published data.</p>
      <p>The main restriction of immunohistochemistry as a technique is missing normalisation. Many factors influence the final signal intensity, considering differences in pre-analytic steps, section thickness, antigen retrieval techniques, antibody quality and concentration, and detection systems. To our knowledge, the approach of normalising an immunohistochemical staining signal by simultaneous measurement of a ‘housekeeping protein' has not been pursued widely and is a field that needs to be developed in the future. Certainly, this would necessitate computer-aided image analysis, which, taken by itself, has not been a major breakthrough so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rizzardi <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>The search for molecular prognostic markers for malignant tumours has been a central aim of biomedical researchers in the last two decades. A more concise diagnosis provided by a molecular marker may facilitate individualised patient treatment. Additionally, prognostic markers might help to unravel the molecular background of tumour progression and even represent an attractive new therapeutic target. Ideally, a prognostic factor only has a few degrees of freedom and allows for a dichotomous or trichotomous readout (e.g., negative/positive or nil/low/high) to ensure a high degree of reproducibility. Unfortunately, this does not exactly hold true for the majority of biomarkers measured on expression level, which necessitate cut-off values to delineate meaningful prognostic subgroups. As these cut-off values are mainly arbitrarily chosen, and the most popular platform to determine protein expression in tumour tissues is immunohistochemistry, it does not surprise that the reproducibility of these prognostic markers is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altman <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>). Promising future exceptions could be genetic events of prognostic value, which may be detected with mutation-specific antibodies. Although it is difficult to overcome the inherent obstacles of contemporary immunohistochemistry, other biological platforms may offer a more robust alternative. As an example, several mRNA expression signatures have been proposed to predict disease progression and are currently undergoing intense verification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cuzick <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karnes <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wu <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although most authors of prognostic biomarker studies in prostate cancer investigate markers for therapy planning at the biopsy stage, these studies, as exemplified in our selection, mainly use RPE specimens (and not preoperatively sampled biopsy material) and analyse disease progression following radical prostatectomy. The inherent but to our knowledge unproven assumption is that markers of disease progression following surgery can also be used upfront to estimate the tumours' endogenous aggressiveness; or, in other words, that <italic>predictive</italic> markers are also <italic>prognostic</italic> markers. The distinction of <italic>prognostic</italic> markers that estimate the natural course of disease and <italic>predictive</italic> markers that estimate the response to therapy is still often ignored. This aspect should be considered carefully, for surgery might indeed heal and not only ameliorate the disease. As the TMPRSS2-ERG translocation illustrates, a biomarker may well allow prognostication in untreated patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Demichelis <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attard <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) but can still fail to predict progression following therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Minner <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pettersson <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Other markers may work in both settings, as demonstrated by the cell cycle proliferation signature, proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cuzick <italic>et al</italic> (2011)</xref>.</p>
      <p>We are convinced that the final and most crucial step in verification of a biomarker for therapy planning at the initial biopsy stage would be a prospective trial in an active surveillance cohort. A reliable biomarker should then be able to identify insignificant tumours that can safely be kept under surveillance for a longer time and do not necessitate active treatment because of the criteria of tumour progression. Even then, long-term follow-up data with either cancer-specific death or onset of castration refractory disease as an endpoint would be highly desirable. Another open point of discussion is, if the commonly used surrogate marker of disease progression, PSA relapse, is delineating a clinically meaningful endpoint, because many patients with a PSA progression will die of other, non-cancer related causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attard and de Bono, 2009</xref>). To complicate the matter, the definition of PSA progression also varies between studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nielsen and Partin, 2007</xref>). It also has to be kept in mind, that it is highly unlikely that molecular prognostic biomarkers solely can supersede the clinico-pathological parameters that build the basis of commonly used nomograms, but are only able to add prognostic information to these. This is in principle good news for histopathologists who should strengthen their efforts to provide even more standardised reports in the future, irrespective of molecular developments.</p>
      <p>In summary, this study sheds some very critical light on contemporary immunohistochemistry studies that aim to identify prognostic biomarkers for prostate cancer. Acknowledging the inherent limitations of this comprehensive meta-analysis and verification study, the majority of published biomarkers could not be confirmed. This is disappointing but in excellent concordance with the skeptical view of biostatisticians and may also be true for other tumour entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ioannidis, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2013</xref>). We feel that in addition to the suggestions made above, the REMARK guidelines, which summarise important cornerstones of biomarker investigations, clearly deserve a wider reception, better acknowledgment, and stricter adherence in order to increase the quality of published data in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McShane <italic>et al</italic>, 2005a</xref>).</p>

    <p>In each cell cycle, a cell duplicates its centrosome, producing a pair of the structures that can serve as the poles of the mitotic spindle. Cancer or developmental defects can stem from mistakes in duplication that result in cells carrying an incorrect number of centrosomes. However, researchers haven’t been able to confirm that centrosomes help organize the mitotic spindle.</p>
    <p>To address this question, Lambrus et al. used a technique that allowed them to remove centrosomes at precise times. They outfitted Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4), a protein that controls centrosome duplication, with a segment known as a degron. Adding a plant hormone spurs the destruction of proteins carrying this segment, and the researchers found that the technique rapidly cut Plk4 levels and blocked centrosome duplication. When the researchers prolonged the depletion of Plk4, cells would divide a couple of times before the cell cycle halted permanently. However, the usual suspects to trigger this growth arrest—DNA damage, improper separation of chromosomes, and prolonged mitosis—weren’t responsible. Lambrus et al. hypothesized that cells have a centrosome surveillance system to protect against harmful mitoses that arise from divisions with the wrong number of centrosomes.</p>
    <p>The researchers found that if they depleted the tumor suppressor p53, cells that chronically lacked Plk4 could divide without centrosomes. These cells made more errors during mitosis, emphasizing the importance of the surveillance mechanism. The next step for researchers is to discover how a cell senses when it’s short on centrosomes.</p>

        <p>VAMP8 is associated with the recycling endosome compartment rather than with cytotoxic granules and is required for a fusion step between recycling endosomes and the plasma membrane that brings syntaxin-11 to the immune synapse for cytotoxic granule exocytosis.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) eliminate infected and neoplastic cells through directed release of cytotoxic granule contents. Although multiple SNARE proteins have been implicated in cytotoxic granule exocytosis, the role of vesicular SNARE proteins, i.e., vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMPs), remains enigmatic. VAMP8 was posited to represent the cytotoxic granule vesicular SNARE protein mediating exocytosis in mice. In primary human CTLs, however, VAMP8 colocalized with Rab11a-positive recycling endosomes. Upon stimulation, these endosomes rapidly trafficked to and fused with the plasma membrane, preceding fusion of cytotoxic granules. Knockdown of VAMP8 blocked both recycling endosome and cytotoxic granule fusion at immune synapses, without affecting activating signaling. Mechanistically, VAMP8-dependent recycling endosomes deposited syntaxin-11 at immune synapses, facilitating assembly of plasma membrane SNARE complexes for cytotoxic granule fusion. Hence, cytotoxic granule exocytosis is a sequential, multivesicle fusion process requiring VAMP8-mediated recycling endosome fusion before cytotoxic granule fusion. Our findings imply that secretory granule exocytosis pathways in other cell types may also be more complex than previously appreciated.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) together with natural killer cells can recognize and kill infected and neoplastic cells. Killing by these cell types is mediated by exocytosis of specialized secretory lysosomes, called cytotoxic granules, which contain the cytotoxic proteins perforin and granzymes (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Trapani and Smyth, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Stinchcombe and Griffiths, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">de Saint Basile et al., 2010</xref>). CTL activation is dictated by somatically recombined, clonally distributed T cell receptors (TCRs) that bind specific complexes of peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules on target cells. Upon engagement, CTLs can induce target cell death within minutes (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lopez et al., 2013</xref>). The immune synapse is a spatially organized site of contact between CTLs and target cells, supporting both directed exocytosis of cytotoxic granules and signaling required for cytokine production (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dustin and Long, 2010</xref>). For CTLs, induction of an immune synapse and full activation requires at least 10 pMHC complexes on the target cell (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Purbhoo et al., 2004</xref>). However, three pMHCs are sufficient to facilitate transient interactions that support target cell killing without formation of a mature immune synapse (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Sykulev et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Faroudi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Purbhoo et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, CTL killing is rapid, extremely sensitive to antigen, and involves a complex intracellular signaling cascade that polarizes proteins required for cytotoxic granule exocytosis toward the target cell interface.</p>
      <p>In eukaryotes, exocytosis as well as intracellular vesicle fusion processes is mediated by transmembrane proteins containing cytoplasmic SNARE domains (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>). Typically, one R-SNARE protein residing on the vesicular membrane and three Q-SNAREs (Qa, Qb, and Qc) proteins residing on the target membrane can span the distance between two membranes, forming a parallel four-helical bundle that catalyzes membrane fusion (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>). When forming a SNARE complex, SNARE proteins evince remarkable specificity for their cognate SNARE partners, resulting in highly specific combinations of SNAREs at differing steps of vesicle fusion (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Scheller, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Ungermann and Langosch, 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>Whereas SNARE-dependent exocytosis has been extensively studied in the context of neurotransmitter release, current research shows that SNARE-dependent exocytosis is also critical for proper immunological function (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Stow et al., 2006</xref>). Mutations in genes encoding the SNARE protein syntaxin-11 (Stx11) and SNARE complex regulators Munc13-4 and Munc18-2, as well as the gene encoding perforin, are all associated with development of an early onset, often fatal, hyperinflammatory syndrome termed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Stepp et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Feldmann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">zur Stadt et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Côte et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, Stx11, Munc13-4, or Munc18-2 deficiency abrogates cytotoxic granule exocytosis and target cell killing by CTL (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bryceson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Côte et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">zur Stadt et al., 2009</xref>). In Stx11-deficient cytotoxic lymphocytes, cytotoxic granules polarize to the target cell interface but fail to fuse with the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bryceson et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that Stx11 mediates cytotoxic granule fusion for target cell killing. With the exception of Stx11, other members of the SNARE complex regulating cytotoxic granule fusion with the plasma membrane have not been clearly defined, although several SNARE-containing candidates have been proposed (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Stow, 2013</xref>). Conjointly, Munc13-4 has also been shown to facilitate intermediate steps of cytotoxic granule maturation, promoting late endosome-to-lysosome fusion (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ménager et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that multiple vesicle fusion steps regulate cytotoxic granule exocytosis and hence, several SNARE complexes might control cytotoxic granule exocytosis.</p>
      <p>The vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) family typically mediates fusion of vesicles with cognate, membrane-associated SNARE complexes, and several VAMPs have been implicated in lymphocyte cytotoxicity. <italic>Vamp2</italic> (encoding VAMP2 or synaptobrevin-2) knockout mice display defective cytotoxic granule exocytosis (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Matti et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, VAMP2 colocalizes with cytotoxic granules, indicating that VAMP2 may serve as a vesicular R-SNARE for cytotoxic granule exocytosis. Concurrently, VAMP4, and VAMP7 also colocalize with cytotoxic granule proteins and siRNA-mediated knockdown in a human natural killer cell line exhibited deficits in lymphocyte cytotoxicity (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Krzewski et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, in mice, VAMP8, an R-SNARE associated with exocytosis of secretory pathway organelles in multiple immune cell types, colocalized with the cytotoxic granule protein granzyme B. <italic>Vamp8</italic> knockout mouse CTLs display reduced granule exocytosis and impaired target cell killing, also indicating that VAMP8 may be required for cytotoxic granule exocytosis (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dressel et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, how distinct VAMPs regulate cytotoxic granule trafficking and fusion for target cell killing is unclear.</p>
      <p>Here, we studied the role of VAMP8 in cytotoxic granule fusion in primary human lymphocytes using structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Examining endogenous as well as fluorescently tagged, ectopically expressed protein, we established that VAMP8 is associated with the recycling endosome compartment rather than with cytotoxic granules. Complimentary approaches revealed that recycling endosomes rapidly accumulated and fused at the immune synapse, preceding the arrival of cytotoxic granules. Strikingly, reduction of VAMP8 expression compromised both recycling endosome and cytotoxic granule fusion, delineating a VAMP8-dependent fusion step between recycling endosomes and the plasma membrane that brings Stx11 to the immune synapse for cytotoxic granule exocytosis. These insights provide a new mechanistic view of cytotoxic lymphocyte exocytosis and bear relevance to how VAMP8 may support regulated secretion in several other cell types.</p>

        <p>We examined human CTL expression of VAMP8, which from studies of knockout mice has been suggested to represent the vesicular SNARE required for cytotoxic granule exocytosis. <italic>VAMP8</italic> transcripts were expressed in human primary CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and their levels increased upon anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 bead stimulation, as assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Upon anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 bead or superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) stimulation, VAMP8 protein expression also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). Notably, in our model, increased expression of VAMP8 upon activation coincided with an increased capacity of the stimulated CTL to kill target cells (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Pattu et al., 2012</xref>). As the proportion of unstimulated, bulk CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing perforin and other cytotoxic granule constituents varies from donor to donor depending on the distribution of different cellular subsets (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chiang et al., 2013</xref>), we used CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells stimulated with beads or SEA that more homogeneously express cytotoxic granule constituents for all further experiments. Such cells are hereafter referred to as CTLs.</p>

        <p>Studies in mice have indicated that VAMP8 is recruited to the immune synapse of CTLs (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al., 2009</xref>). We found that numerous VAMP8-carrying vesicles also accumulated at the immune synapse of human CTL conjugated with SEA-pulsed target cells, as revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy and SIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). SIM increases the spatial resolution of fluorescence microscopes to resolve colocalization within a resolution of 100 nm in x, y, and z direction (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gustafsson, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Gustafsson et al., 2008</xref>). A similar accumulation of VAMP8 at immune synapses was observed upon expression of full-length VAMP8 fused to TFP (VAMP8-TFP) in target cell–conjugated CTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). A twofold accumulation of endogenous and ectopically expressed TFP-tagged VAMP8, respectively (2.2 ± 0.2–fold and 2.0 ± 0.1–fold for endogenous VAMP8 vs. ectopically expressed VAMP8-TFP, <italic>n</italic> = 10 and 11 CTLs, respectively), toward target cells was observed. Notably, both VAMP8-TFP and VAMP8-mCherry constructs colocalized well with endogenous VAMP8, implying that these C-terminally tagged constructs properly localized to VAMP8-carrying vesicles (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201411093/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1, A and B</ext-link>).

        <title>VAMP8 colocalizes with recycling endosomes rather than perforin-containing cytotoxic granules</title>
        <p>We set out to decipher how VAMP8 may facilitate cytotoxic granule exocytosis. In contrast to studies of mouse CTL (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al., 2009</xref>), we found VAMP8 localization to be distinct from that of granzyme B in unconjugated, fixed human primary CTLs using SIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Of note, VAMP8-carrying compartments were more numerous than those with granzyme B. Upon conjugation with SEA-pulsed target cells, VAMP8-carrying vesicles did not start to colocalize with those containing granzyme B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Similarly, VAMP8-carrying vesicles did not colocalize with perforin-containing vesicles in unconjugated or conjugated CTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>). Unexpectedly, we conclude that VAMP8 localized to a compartment distinct from cytotoxic granules in human CTLs.</p>

        <p>Having established that VAMP8 did not colocalize with cytotoxic granules, we sought the identity of the endosomal compartment that did contain VAMP8. CTLs were transfected with VAMP8-TFP and various endosomal markers coupled to mCherry. CTLs were thereafter mixed with SEA-pulsed target cells, fixed, and imaged using SIM. Imaging revealed limited colocalization between VAMP8 and Rab5a, a marker of early endosomes (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Rybin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Barysch et al., 2009</xref>), or Rab7a, a marker of late endosomes (Pearson’s coefficient r of 0.34/0.39 and 0.36/0.36, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201411093/DC1" id="supp2">S2</ext-link>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chavrier et al., 1990</xref>).

Overall, VAMP8 preferentially localized to recycling endosomes in CTLs, with its distribution not being drastically affected by stimulation.

        <title>VAMP8-carrying recycling endosomes traffic and fuse with the plasma membrane at immune synapses</title>
        <p>Although VAMP8 exhibited strong colocalization with recycling endosomes in our fixed cell experiments, it was unclear whether these VAMP8 vesicles were also trafficking through the recycling endosome compartment and fusing at the immune synapse. To examine the behavior of VAMP8-carrying vesicles, we used TIRF microscopy to visualize vesicle dynamics in the vicinity of the immune synapse. This technique allows real-time visualization of vesicles within 200 nm of the immune synapse (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Campi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Douglass and Vale, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Yokosuka et al., 2005</xref>). Transfection of CTLs with VAMP8-TFP showed rapid movement and subsequent accumulation of VAMP8-carrying vesicles in the TIRF plane (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201411093/DC1" id="supp3">Video 1</ext-link>). To simultaneously monitor the dynamics of VAMP8 and recycling endosomes, CTLs were cotransfected with VAMP8-TFP and Rab11a-mCherry and allowed to form synapses with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibody-coated coverslips. Shortly after sedimentation, the appearance and subsequent accumulation of both VAMP8- and Rab11a-containing vesicles could be observed at the immune synapse in the TIRF plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201411093/DC1" id="supp4">Video 2</ext-link>). VAMP8-TFP and Rab11a-mCherry exhibited a striking colocalization in the TIRF plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). In comparing the dwell times at the immune synapse, we found that there was no statistically significant difference between Rab11a-mCherry vesicles and VAMP8-TFP vesicles, with VAMP8 dwell time of 14.5 ± 0.7 s compared with 15.7 ± 0.9 s of Rab11a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>).

        <p>Interestingly, several rapid fluorescence dispersion events, characteristic of vesicle fusion, were also observed in the TIRF plane (Video 2). Such events were defined as a sudden reduction in fluorescence within 400 ms (i.e., four images), which could be distinguished from movement of granules back into the cell (undocking) that typically lasted &gt;1 s (see Materials and methods for analysis details). Cells exhibited a similar number of such fusion-like events for both VAMP8-TFP and Rab11a-mCherry (46.9 ± 6.4 vs. 54.0 ± 8.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Quantification of the cumulative data revealed that rapid fluorescence dispersion events occurred promptly after immune synapse formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). Together, the concerted appearance and fusion-like events, characterized by the quickly forming lateral diffusion clouds, of VAMP8-TFP and Rab11a-mCherry seen in our live imaging (Video 2), clearly indicated that VAMP8 and Rab11a traffic in the same vesicle that may fuse with the plasma membrane subsequently.</p>
        <p>To formally demonstrate fusion of VAMP8-carrying recycling endosomes with the plasma membrane, we transfected CTLs with a construct encoding VAMP8 tagged with C-terminal, lumenal 3×FLAG and TFP. Upon fusion of VAMP8-carrying vesicles, the FLAG-tag will be exposed to the extracellular milieu. Addition of the anti-FLAG antibody to the extracellular milieu followed by flow cytometry and gating on TFP-expressing cells revealed some constitutive expression of VAMP8 on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, F and G</xref>). Upon stimulation with anti-CD3 antibodies, VAMP8 expression on the plasma membrane rapidly increased threefold. Furthermore, to study the characteristics of individual recycling endosome fusion events, CTLs were transfected with a construct encoding VAMP8 tagged with C-terminal, lumenal pHluorin and mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 H</xref>). pHluorin is a pH-sensitive variant of GFP that has been used to study vesicle fusion of VAMP2-carrying vesicles in neuronal and endocrine cells (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Miesenböck et al., 1998</xref>). Transfected cells were imaged by TIRF microscopy. Some vesicles first docked at the immune synapse before undergoing rapid fusion and dispersion of VAMP8 and pHluorin signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 H</xref>, left; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201411093/DC1" id="supp5">Video 3</ext-link>). In contrast, many vesicles fused immediately after reaching the plasma membrane, sometimes with pHluorin signals remaining clustered before dispersion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 H</xref>, right; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201411093/DC1" id="supp6">Fig. S3</ext-link>; and Video 3). Altogether, these results demonstrate that numerous VAMP8-carrying recycling endosomes are rapidly recruited to and fuse with the plasma membrane at CTL immune synapses.</p>

        <title>VAMP8-containing recycling endosome fusion precedes perforin-containing cytotoxic granule fusion</title>
        <p>To gain further insights to the relationship between VAMP8-carrying recycling endosome activity and cytotoxic granule exocytosis at human immune synapses, CTLs were cotransfected with VAMP8-TFP and perforin-mCherry and allowed to form a synapse with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibody-coated coverslips. CTLs were imaged in real-time by TIRF microscopy. Interestingly, in live-cell imaging, multiple VAMP8-carrying recycling endosomes rapidly appeared in the TIRF plane followed by fewer perforin-containing vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201411093/DC1" id="supp7">Video 4</ext-link>). Comparing the dwell times of both VAMP8 and perforin vesicles in the TIRF plane, the former resided significantly shorter than the latter (14.5 ± 0.8 s for VAMP8-carrying vesicles vs. 117.4 ± 18.9 s for perforin-containing vesicles, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). The accumulation of VAMP8-carrying recycling endosomes outnumbered that of perforin-containing cytotoxic granules at the immune synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). At the start of the 6-min recording, VAMP8-carrying vesicles showed rapid accumulation that subsided with time. By comparison, perforin-containing vesicles appeared later in the TIRF plane. Comparing fusion-like events revealed by imaging of VAMP8-TFP and perforin-mCherry, CTLs exhibited many more VAMP8 versus perforin fusion-like events per cell (41.6 ± 7.6 vs. 2.4 ± 0.1, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). As previously noted, the VAMP8-carrying vesicle fusion-like events occurred promptly after immune synapse formation and then gradually subsided with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Similar results were also found upon cotransfection of CTL with VAMP8-TFP and granzyme B–mCherry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201411093/DC1" id="supp8">Fig. S4</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201411093/DC1" id="supp9">Video 5</ext-link>). In summary, VAMP8-carrying recycling endosome fusion preceded cytotoxic granule exocytosis, implying that recycling endosome fusion with the plasma membrane might be VAMP8 dependent and represent a prerequisite for cytotoxic granule exocytosis.</p>

        <p>Studies of knockout mice have implicated VAMP8 in many forms of secretory granule secretion (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Paumet et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dressel et al., 2010</xref>). Despite not being localized to cytotoxic granules in human CTL, we examined whether siRNA-mediated VAMP8 knockdown would affect cytotoxic granule exocytosis. First, we performed TIRF microscopy on CTL transfected with VAMP8 siRNA and the cytotoxic granule marker granzyme B–mCherry to visualize cytotoxic granule trafficking and fusion. After sedimentation of CTLs, cytotoxic granules could be observed fusing at the immune synapse in the TIRF plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201411093/DC1" id="supp12">Video 7</ext-link>). Knockdown of VAMP8 did not significantly change the mean dwell time of granzyme B–containing vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 F</xref>). In contrast to cells transfected with control siRNA, VAMP8 siRNA–transfected cells showed a strong reduction (&gt;87%) in granzyme B–mCherry fusion-like events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 G</xref> and Video 7). Moreover, VAMP8 knockdown also reduced degranulation as measured by induced surface expression of CD107a (also known as lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 [LAMP-1]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, H and I</xref>). These experiments revealed that VAMP8 is required for both recycling endosome and cytotoxic granule fusion with the plasma membrane. Although our results suggested that VAMP8 is required for an early fusion event obligatory to cytotoxic granule exocytosis, it was not clear whether VAMP8-mediated fusion of recycling endosomes with the plasma membrane is required for TCR signaling and immune synapse formation or, further downstream and more specifically, the assembly of the plasma membrane SNARE complex for cytotoxic granule fusion.</p>

        <title>VAMP8 regulates Stx11 deposition at immune synapses but not proximal TCR signaling</title>
        <p>To further dissect the mechanism whereby VAMP8 facilitates lymphocyte cytotoxicity, we first studied the impact of VAMP8 knockdown on TCR signaling in human CTLs. CTLs were transfected with control siRNA or VAMP8 siRNA, labeled with Fluo-4 and Fura red Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive dyes, and assessed by ratiometric flow cytometry. Knockdown of VAMP8 did not significantly alter intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization after TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figs. 7 A</xref> and S5 D), which is crucial for lymphocyte cytotoxicity (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Maul-Pavicic et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, knockdown of VAMP8 did not reduce phosphorylation of the MAPK extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) after TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, B and C</xref>; and Fig. S5 E). ERK phosphorylation has been implicated in cytotoxic lymphocyte granule polarization (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, VAMP8 was not required for proximal TCR signals leading to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and phosphorylation of ERK. To study actin dynamics, CTLs were cotransfected with recombinant, fluorescently tagged actin (LifeAct-GFP) and control siRNA or VAMP8 siRNA and subsequently imaged by TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, D and E</xref>; and Fig. S5 F). In line with the experiments negating a role for VAMP8 in proximal TCR-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and phosphorylation of ERK, knockdown of VAMP8 did not affect established F-actin architectural phases during immune synapse formation (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rak et al., 2011</xref>). An even distribution of F-actin was initially observed upon contact with the coverslip. After cell spreading and within ∼40 s, distribution of F-actin around the cell perimeter was observed. This annular distribution was accompanied by the appearance of granule-sized clearance in the actin meshwork and normal cell spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, E and F</xref>). In conclusion, our results indicated that VAMP8-mediated fusion with the plasma membrane is not required for proximal TCR-induced signaling and actin reorganization.</p>

        <p>We have recently shown that Stx11 localizes to recycling endosomes in human CTLs (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Halimani et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore postulated that knockdown of VAMP8 might change Stx11 dynamics and interfere with downstream cytotoxic granule exocytosis. To test this hypothesis, CTLs were cotransfected with Stx11-mCherry and control siRNA or VAMP8 siRNA. CTLs were subsequently imaged using TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figs. 7 G</xref> and S5 G and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201411093/DC1" id="supp13">Video 8</ext-link>). Knockdown of VAMP8 led to an increase in dwell time of Stx11-carrying vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 H</xref>). Paralleling this, knockdown of VAMP8 led to a cumulative increase in the number of Stx11-carrying vesicles as well as the overall Stx11 fluorescence intensity in the TIRF plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, I and J</xref>). Remarkably, Stx11 vesicle fluorescence dispersion events were greatly reduced in VAMP8 knockdown compared with control CTLs (10 ± 3.9 vs. 1.3 ± 1.26, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 K</xref>). VAMP8 and, even more so, Stx11 fluorescence dispersion events were predominately focused toward the center of the immune synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, L–N</xref>) suggesting a degree of recycling endosome exocytosis polarization. With respect to the radial distribution of Stx11, VAMP8 knockdown resulted in an increased central clustering of Stx11-carrying vesicles at the immune synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 O</xref>), possibly reflecting a microtubule-organizing complex–coordinated polarization of recycling endosomes toward the immune synapse. With VAMP8 knockdown, Stx11 deposition and diffusion in the membrane would be reduced, resulting in an increased central clustering of Stx11. Hence, our results suggest that Stx11 deposition into the plasma membrane is specifically mediated by VAMP8 recycling endosome fusion.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The mechanisms of lymphocyte cytotoxicity have not been fully elucidated (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">de Saint Basile et al., 2010</xref>). In studying the R-SNARE candidate VAMP8, we made several unexpected discoveries. Super high resolution imaging of both endogenous and ectopically expressed VAMP8 in primary human CTLs established that VAMP8 localizes to the Rab11a-positive recycling endosome compartment rather than to cytotoxic granules. Complimentary approaches demonstrated that VAMP8-carrying recycling endosomes rapidly fuse with the plasma membrane upon TCR engagement of CTLs. Moreover, VAMP8 knockdown demonstrated a critical role for VAMP8 in fusion of recycling endosomes with the plasma membrane at immune synapses. In agreement with previous studies of <italic>Vamp8</italic> knockout mice (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dressel et al., 2010</xref>), VAMP8 knockdown also impaired cytotoxic granule exocytosis by human CTLs. Intriguingly, we found that VAMP8 knockdown did not diminish proximal TCR signaling, implying that VAMP8-mediated fusion plays a more specific role in promoting cytotoxic granule exocytosis. Our data suggest that VAMP8-dependent recycling endosome fusion deposits the Qa-SNARE Stx11, localized to recycling endosomes in unstimulated CTL (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Halimani et al., 2014</xref>), on the plasma membrane at immune synapses for cytotoxic granule exocytosis.</p>
      <p>CTLs survey tissues for aberrant cells and can engage and kill target cells within 2 min through regulated exocytosis of specialized secretory lysosomes (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lopez et al., 2013</xref>). Exocytosis of cytotoxic proteins needs to be stringently controlled. Remarkably, we found accumulation and exocytosis of numerous VAMP8-carrying, Rab11-positive recycling endosomes within seconds of CTL contact with anti-CD3–coated coverslips. The exocytosis of these vesicles not only outnumbered but also preceded that of perforin- and granzyme B–containing cytotoxic granules. On average, 40 or more recycling endosomes fused with the plasma membrane within 4 min of CTL immune synapse formation. By comparison, less than five fusion-like events of cytotoxic granules were observed per cell. Recycling endosomes have previously been implicated in SNARE-dependent accumulation of TCR clusters to the immune synapse (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Das et al., 2004</xref>). Specifically, synaptotagmin 7 and VAMP7 mediate fusion of vesicles containing TCR and LAT, respectively (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Larghi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Soares et al., 2013</xref>). TCR-induced signaling is impaired in VAMP7-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Larghi et al., 2013</xref>). Whether these vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane or form intracellular signaling platforms is disputed. Our data suggest that VAMP8 mediates recycling endosome fusion with the plasma membrane for delivery of molecules required for cytotoxic granule exocytosis but is not crucial for T cell activation. There is quite possibly heterogeneity in the lymphocyte recycling endosome compartment, where different vesicles may contribute to intracellular signaling versus delivery of cargo to the plasma membrane. Importantly, we find that VAMP8 is required for deposition of Stx11, an effector molecule of cytotoxic granule fusion (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bryceson et al., 2007</xref>), at the immune synapse. Thus, we posit a two-step sequential process for lymphocyte cytotoxicity in which VAMP8-mediated recycling endosome fusion brings effector proteins to the plasma membrane for SNARE complex formation and subsequent cytotoxic granule exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). Our data suggest that recycling endosome fusion is clustered toward the center of the immune synapse, possibly reflecting involvement of the microtubule-organizing complex in both recycling endosome and cytotoxic granule exocytosis. It is possible that additional engagement of integrins at cytotoxic immune synapses would further promote polarization of the recycling endosome compartment to a focal site of exocytosis (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Stinchcombe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, although our data suggest recycling endosome fusion is critical for delivery of Stx11 to the immune synapse, it is also possible that VAMP8-mediated recycling endosome fusion with the plasma membrane provides other proteins required for cytotoxic granule exocytosis. It is worth noting that Munc13-4 also resides on Rab11-positive recycling endosomes (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ménager et al., 2007</xref>). Besides mediating cytotoxic granule to plasma membrane fusion, Munc13-4 has been previously proposed to promote late endosome to lysosome fusion, facilitating cytotoxic granule maturation (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Ménager et al., 2007</xref>). It will therefore be interesting to address how distinct Munc13-4 isoforms may be involved in regulating exocytosis of recycling endosomes and cytotoxic granules (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cichocki et al., 2014</xref>). In summary, our findings unravel a novel component of vesicular fusion for lymphocyte cytotoxicity, providing a new layer of control in the carefully orchestrated process of target cell killing.</p>

          <p><bold>Proposed sequential model for cytotoxic lymphocyte exocytosis.</bold> (A) After target cell recognition, numerous small recycling endosomes (RE) carrying VAMP8 and Stx11 (1) traffic to the CTL immune synapse and (2) undergo VAMP8-dependent fusion with the plasma membrane, possibly through interaction with plasma membrane Stx4 and SNAP-23 SNARE complex partners. Such exocytosis of recycling endosomes deposits high amounts of Stx11 molecules in the plasma membrane, which may (3) lead to the formation of Stx11 and SNAP-23 SNARE complexes. Initial activity at the immune synapse thus forms “active zones” where (4) docking through interactions of R-SNARE proteins on larger cytotoxic granules (CGs) with plasma membrane Stx11–SNAP-23 complexes can facilitate (5) cytotoxic granule exocytosis that releases cargo necessary for target cell killing. </p>

      <p>Several genes required for cytotoxic granule exocytosis have been linked to development of early onset, often fatal hyperinflammatory syndromes such as HLH. Loss-of-function mutations in <italic>VAMP8</italic> have so far not been associated with HLH. The very small coding region of <italic>VAMP8</italic> may explain why deficiencies in VAMP8 are exceedingly rare, and patients have not been described to date. Alternatively, VAMP8 deficiency may lead to a disparate clinical presentation. Notably, one third of <italic>Vamp8</italic> knockout mice die before the age of 1 mo (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kanwar et al., 2008</xref>). By comparison, <italic>Prf1</italic> knockout mice are healthy until challenged by viral infection (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kägi et al., 1994</xref>), suggesting that VAMP8 mediates vital physiological functions in addition to lymphocyte cytotoxicity. Such functions may include pancreatic secretion. Thus, VAMP8 deficiency in humans may give rise to a distinct phenotype or be embryonically lethal.</p>
      <p>VAMP8 was originally identified as a widely expressed R-SNARE predominantly localized to the early endocytic pathway (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 1998</xref>). Blocking studies in cell lines using antisera suggest that VAMP8 mediated homotypic fusion of early as well as late endosomes (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Antonin et al., 2000b</xref>). Although VAMP8 has not been previously linked to recycling endosome fusion with the plasma membrane, several recent studies have implicated VAMP8 in secretory exocytic pathways of various cell types. In the pancreas, VAMP8 facilitates release of zymogen from acinar cells secretory granules by forming a SNARE complex with Qa-SNARE Stx4 and the Qb/Qc-SNARE SNAP-23 (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Studies of knockout mice have revealed that VAMP8, but not VAMP2 or VAMP3, is required for secretory granule exocytosis in platelets (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, studies of human and mouse mast cells have shown that VAMP8 mediates release of serotonin from lysosomal secretory granules (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Puri and Roche, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sander et al., 2008</xref>). However, these studies did not establish the localization or trafficking of VAMP8 by high-resolution microscopy. Our data investigating the subcellular localization of endogenous, as well as ectopically expressed VAMP8, in CTLs clearly established localization of VAMP8 to a subset of Rab11a-positive recycling endosomes. Moreover, using luminal tags or pH-sensitive probes, we demonstrated that VAMP8-carrying vesicles undergo fusion with the plasma membrane at immune synapses before secretory/cytotoxic granule exocytosis. In light of our novel insights into the vesicle fusion processes regulating lymphocyte cytotoxicity, dissections of VAMP8-dependent secretory granule exocytosis pathways in other cell types using high-resolution imaging are warranted. It is an intriguing possibility that VAMP8-mediated recycling endosome fusion may also represent a previously unrecognized step in the release of secretory granule contents by these other cell types, potentially revealing additional layers of complexity to their exocytic pathways.</p>
      <p>The identity of other components of the SNARE complex mediating recycling endosome fusion in CTLs is not clear. VAMP8 can form a complex with Stx7, Stx8, and Vti1b for late endosome to lysosome fusion (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Antonin et al., 2000a</xref>). In primary human CTLs, Stx4 localizes to the plasma membrane and accumulates at the immune synapse (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Pattu et al., 2012</xref>), making it a strong SNARE candidate for the recycling endosome fusion. Preliminary immunoprecipitation experiments in our laboratory indicated that VAMP8 also interacts with Stx4 in CTL but failed to show any interaction with Stx7 or Stx8 (unpublished data). Additional experiments are required to verify the identity and spatiotemporal dynamics of the other SNARE complex partners, mediating recycling endosome to plasma membrane fusion in lymphocytes.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our findings reveal a role for VAMP8 in fusion of recycling endosomes with the plasma membrane. In CTLs, our data demonstrate that VAMP8-dependent recycling endosome fusion mediates plasma membrane delivery of proteins, i.e., Stx11, specifically required for cytotoxic granule exocytosis. Our data provide a new mechanistic view of cytotoxic lymphocyte exocytosis. In conjunction with the literature on VAMP8, our findings may warrant further high-resolution functional dissection of exocytosis in other cell types in which VAMP8 has been implicated in release of secretory granule content.</p>

Lysates were rotated for 30 min at 4°C, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 RCF. The protein concentration in lysates was determined using Bradford assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE; Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen), and blocked by incubation with 5% skim milk powder in 20 mM Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4, and TBS for 2 h or overnight and blotted with specific antibodies. Blots were developed using enhanced chemoluminescence reagents (SuperSignal West Dura Chemoluminescent Substrate; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and scanned. For expression analysis, the pixel area and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) were determined with ImageJ v1.46 (National Institutes of Health).

        <p>To conjugate CTLs with target cells, Raji cells were pulsed with 10 µg/ml SEA at 37°C for 30 min. The stimulation of Raji cells was performed in 96-well plates with a maximum of one million cells resuspended in 100 µl AIM V medium. The CTL- and SEA-pulsed Raji cells were washed once with AIM V and resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml. CTLs were mixed with target cells at a 1:1 ratio and left in suspension for 5 min at 37°C. The cell suspension was then diluted to a concentration of 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml with AIM V medium and plated onto poly-ornithine–coated 12-mm glass coverslips and incubated at 37°C for 15 min. Cells were fixed in ice-cold 4% PFA in Dulbecco’s PBS (Invitrogen) and stained with antibodies. The SIM setup was a prototype obtained from Carl Zeiss. Images were acquired with a 63× Plan-Apochromat (NA 1.4) with laser excitation at 488, 561, and 635 nm and then processed to obtain higher resolutions (Zen 2009; Carl Zeiss). For analysis of colocalization, Pearson’s and Mander’s coefficients were determined using the JACoP plugin of ImageJ v1.46r.</p>

        <title>TIRF microscopy</title>
        <p>The setup consisted of an inverted microscope (Optical IX70; Olympus), a solid-state laser system (85YCA010; Melles Griot) emitting at 561 nm, a TILL-TIRF condenser (T.I.L.L. Photonics), and an Acousto Optical Tunable Filter-nC (AA Opto-Electronic). The excitation/emission wavelengths were visualized with a dual-view camera splitter (Visitron Systems) to separate the red and green channels and a monochromator (Visichrome; Visitron Systems) to acquire images in epifluorescence. The setup was equipped with a camera (MicroMAX 512 BFT; Princeton Instruments) controlled by MetaMorph (Visitron Systems). A 100×/1.45 NA TIRF objective (Olympus Optical) was used. For some experiments, cells were imaged using a multiphoton confocal microscope (A1R; Nikon) with a 60×/1.49 NA Plan Apochromat objective using 488- and 561-nm lasers and a camera (iXon X3; Andor Technology). The exposure time was 100–150 ms. Experiments were performed at room temperature. Images were acquired using MetaMorph version 6.3 or NIS Elements (Nikon).</p>
        <p>For live-cell imaging, human bead-stimulated CTLs were transfected with plasmids, washed, and resuspended in 30 µl AIM V medium and allowed to settle on anti-CD3– and anti-CD28–coated coverslips in an isotonic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free modified Ringer’s solution (mM: 155 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 5 Hepes, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 glucose; 300–310 osM). Cells were then perfused with modified Ringer’s solution containing 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> to optimize Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during secretion and subsequently imaged for 15–20 min.

        <title>Image analysis</title>
        <p>Images and time-lapse series were analyzed using MetaMorph 6.3, ImageJ 1.46r, or the FIJI package of ImageJ. For vesicle dwell time and fusion analysis, analysis was performed with ImageJ 1.46r. Vesicles were defined as constituting 4–6 pixels. Dwell times in the TIRF plane were calculated manually for all vesicles in a cell. Cytotoxic granule fusion analysis was performed using ImageJ plugin Time Series Analyzer v.2.0. A sudden drop in the fluorescence within or &lt;300 ms (three frames) was defined as a (fusion-like) fluorescence dispersion event.</p>
        <p>Accumulation analysis was performed with ImageJ 1.46r. In brief, raw data files obtained from TIRF microscopy acquisitions were converted to 8 bits, and background was subtracted from the raw data of TIRF stacks using a Lipschitz filter with a top hat of 10. A threshold for vesicle accumulation was set as the mean gray value of background added 2 SD. The mean fluorescence of the area above threshold was obtained for every frame of the time-lapse video for each individual cell. A ratio was made between the threshold area and number of vesicles for a minimum of 10 frames for every cell (area/no. of vesicles = ratio). The threshold area was then divided by this ratio for all the time frames to get the number of vesicles for each frame. The mean number of vesicles in several cells was then plotted against the time (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Pattu et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
        <p>To quantify the F-actin clearance ratio at the immunological synapse, the MFI of the whole cell actin (MF1) was subtracted from the inner circular region of interest in the center of the immune synapse (MF2). Thus, a negative value indicates that the outer region has higher mean intensity than the inner region. The actin intensities were then divided by the actin footprint (MF1 × area of MF1) to normalize the data, averaged, and plotted against time.</p>

        <p>For evaluation of VAMP8 surface expression or cytotoxic granule exocytosis, human PBMCs were isolated from healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation (Lymphoprep). CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were isolated from PBMCs by negative magnetic selection (CD8<sup>+</sup> negative isolation kit) and stimulated with antibody-coated beads (Dynabeads Human T-Activator CD3/CD28) in complete medium. The bead-stimulated CTLs were transfected with constructs encoding VAMP8-TFP, VAMP8-3×FLAG-TFP, or siRNA as indicated. CTLs were supplemented with 10 µg/ml anti-CD3 and 30 µg/ml anti-CD28 antibodies and mixed with P815 cells for the indicated time points at 37°C. Thereafter, the cells were surface stained on ice with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry (LSR Fortessa; BD). FLAG expression was quantified on gated CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>TFP<sup>+</sup> CTLs, and the frequency of CD107a<sup>+</sup> cells was determined among total CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs with FlowJo software (v.9.7.5; Tree Star).</p>
        <p>For assessment of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization, bead-stimulated CTLs were incubated with 10 µg/ml anti-CD3 or IgG control antibody in 50 µl HBSS with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Biosource) supplemented with 1% FBS for 30 min on ice. The cells were subsequently loaded with Fluo-4 and Fura red dyes on ice and prepared for flow cytometry as previously described (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bryceson et al., 2006</xref>). The cells were preincubated for 5 min at 37°C, and then, baseline was acquired on the flow cytometer for 30 s followed by addition of 5 µg goat anti–mouse F(ab′)<sub>2</sub> antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and further flow cytometric evaluation. CTLs were gated on forward scatter/side scatter plots. The ratio between the MFI of FL-1 and FL-3 was calculated and plotted as a function of time using FlowJo software (v.9.7.5).</p>

        <p>Fig. 1 shows colocalization of endogenous and ectopically expressed VAMP8. Fig. S2 shows that VAMP8 vesicles localize with Rab11a on recycling endosomal structures. Fig. S3 shows that VAMP8-carrying vesicles are rapidly recruited to and fuse with the plasma membrane at cytotoxic lymphocyte immune synapses. Fig. S4 shows that VAMP8 is not colocalized with granzyme B–containing granules. Fig. S5 shows that VAMP8 expression is strongly down-regulated and proximal TCR signaling is normal when VAMP8 expression in down-regulated by siRNA. Video 1 shows that VAMP8 accumulates and disperses at the immune synapse upon antigen receptor engagement. Video 2 shows that VAMP8 vesicles traffic and accumulate at the immune synapse with recycling endosomes markers upon antigen receptor engagement. Video 3 shows that VAMP8-carrying recycling endosomes are rapidly recruited to and fuse with the plasma membrane at immune synapses. Video 4 shows that VAMP8-carrying and perforin-containing vesicles have different spatial and temporal characteristics. Video 5 shows that VAMP8 and granzyme B have different spatial and temporal characteristics. Video 6 shows that recycling endosome fusion is inhibited upon knockdown of endogenous VAMP8 expression. Video 7 shows that cytotoxic granule fusion is inhibited upon knockdown of endogenous VAMP8 expression. Video 8 shows deposition of Stx11 and the immune synapse upon knockdown of endogenous VAMP8 expression.

        <p><italic>C. elegans</italic> transition zone structures are dispensable for axoneme assembly but are required for cell–matrix interactions during neurite extension, revealing an unexpected role for the transition zone in cell adhesion.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Cilia are cellular projections that perform sensory and motile functions. A key ciliary subdomain is the transition zone, which lies between basal body and axoneme. Previous work in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> identified two ciliopathy-associated protein complexes or modules that direct assembly of transition zone Y-links. Here, we identify <italic>C. elegans</italic> CEP290 as a component of a third module required to form an inner scaffolding structure called the central cylinder. Co-inhibition of all three modules completely disrupted transition zone structure. Surprisingly, axoneme assembly was only mildly perturbed. However, dendrite extension by retrograde migration was strongly impaired, revealing an unexpected role for the transition zone in cell adhesion.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The cilium is an evolutionarily ancient structure found in most eukaryotic lineages (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hodges et al., 2010</xref>). Projecting from the cell surface, cilia mediate sensory perception and developmental signaling. A subset of cilia is also motile, enabling movement of cells and fluids. Cilia dysfunction has been linked to a spectrum of human disorders, known as ciliopathies (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fliegauf et al., 2007</xref>), ranging from disorders affecting a single type of cilium to broad-based disorders affecting multiple tissues and organs.</p>
      <p>All cilia arise from a centriole-derived basal body, connected to the plasma membrane via transition fibers. The axonemal microtubules constituting the core of the cilium are extensions of basal body microtubules. Immediately distal to the basal body lies the transition zone, distinguished by several conserved features, including a central cylinder or apical ring that lies internal to the microtubule doublets and Y-links connecting axonemal microtubules to the ciliary membrane (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Reiter et al., 2012</xref>). The ciliary membrane is contiguous with the plasma membrane but is compositionally distinct, as is the underlying cytoplasm, suggesting that structures at the ciliary base (the transition fibers and/or transition zone) control access to the ciliary compartment (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>During ciliogenesis, centrioles dock to a membrane, either to a vesicle in the cytoplasm that fuses with the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Sorokin, 1962</xref>) or to the plasma membrane itself. Docking requires the transition fibers (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>), which in vertebrates are derived from appendages present on mature centrioles. Finally, motor-driven intraflagellar transport (IFT; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 1998</xref>) extends the ciliary axoneme. While the molecular mechanisms underlying axoneme extension are comparatively well understood, less is known about basal ciliary structures and their role in the early stages of ciliogenesis (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Reiter et al., 2012</xref>). For the transition zone, proteomic approaches in vertebrates identified three distinct ciliopathy-associated multiprotein complexes or modules: the MKS, NPHP-1,-4,-8 (NPHP) and NPHP-5,-6 (CEP290) modules (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Gonzalo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Sang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chih et al., 2012</xref>). These are supported by genetic analyses in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, which have established independent assembly pathways for two modules (MKS and NPHP; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). It is currently unclear where these modules fit within the transition zone structure or how it assembles during ciliogenesis. Further, while the transition zone clearly functions as a ciliary gate, there is some uncertainty as to what extent it is also required for axoneme assembly, with loss of transition zone components in vertebrates resulting in loss of cilia in some tissues but not others (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Gonzalo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Sang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chih et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>The nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> has emerged as a major experimental model to study centrioles and cilia. A key feature of <italic>C. elegans</italic> is that cilia are limited to the dendritic endings of postmitotic sensory neurons and are dispensable for viability and fertility, which facilitates loss-of-function studies (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Inglis et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we take advantage of this experimental model to dissect the assembly and function of the transition zone. We identify a <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologue of CEP290 and show it to be a component of a third, independently targeted transition zone module required to form the central cylinder, which acts as an inner scaffolding structure for transition zone assembly. Simultaneous inhibition of all three modules completely disrupts transition zone structure. Surprisingly, axoneme assembly is not significantly impaired. Instead, perturbing the transition zone disrupts cell–matrix interactions during dendrite extension, revealing an unexpected role for the transition zone in cell adhesion.</p>

      <title>Results and discussion</title>
      <p>Increasing evidence points to the transition zone being organized into multiple protein complexes or modules with distinct functions. Best characterized are the MKS and NPHP modules, which are composed of proteins mutated in the ciliopathies Meckel syndrome and nephronophthisis. Previous work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> showed these to be recruited independently of each other and function redundantly in assembly of transition zone Y-links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). Proteomic analysis in vertebrates identified a potential third module including the key ciliopathy protein CEP290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Sang et al., 2011</xref>). Reciprocal BLAST searches identified a <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologue encoded by the predicted gene <italic>Y47G6A.17</italic>, which we named CCEP-290 for <italic>C. elegans</italic> CEP290 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201501013/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1, A and B</ext-link>). Phylogenetic analysis found CEP290 to be conserved across all major eukaryotic phyla, supporting a central role for this protein at the transition zone (Fig. S1 C; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hodges et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

      <p>Generation of a single-copy GFP transgene under control of endogenous regulatory sequences revealed expression exclusively in ciliated neurons in a manner dependent on the transcription factor DAF-19 (Fig. S1 D), which serves as a master regulator of ciliogenesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Swoboda et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with localization to transition zones, CCEP-290 was found distal to the basal body marker HYLS-1 (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dammermann et al., 2009</xref>) but proximal to the axoneme positive for polyglutamylated tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Comparisons by high-resolution two-color fluorescence imaging (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2009</xref>) using HYLS-1 as a point of reference showed this localization to be distinct from that of the MKS and NPHP module components MKSR-2 and NPHP-4. Whereas MKSR-2 and NPHP-4 localized to the transition zone periphery, consistent with localization to Y-links or the ciliary membrane, CCEP-290 occupied a more central position (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201501013/DC1" id="supp3">Fig. S2, A and B</ext-link>). CCEP-290 recruitment was unaffected in mutants of MKS-5, MKSR-2, and NPHP-4, the most upstream components of the MKS and NPHP assembly pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). CCEP-290 therefore independently targets to the transition zone.</p>
      <p>Since <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons are refractory to RNAi, we obtained an in-frame deletion mutant, <italic>ccep-290(tm4927)</italic>, hereafter referred to as <italic>ccep-290</italic>, affecting the N terminus of the protein (Fig. S1 E). We also generated a complete gene deletion, <italic>ccep-290Δ</italic>, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing (Fig. S1 F). Both mutants, as well as two additional C-terminal truncation mutants, were found to be viable and fertile, with no apparent morphological defects (Fig. S1 G and not depicted). Examining other transition zone proteins in <italic>ccep-290Δ</italic> mutants, we observed no change in localization of NPHP-4. In contrast, MKSR-2 at transition zones appeared much reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>), which is consistent with recent findings in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Basiri et al., 2014</xref>). Localization of downstream components of the MKS pathway was also perturbed (Fig. S2 C). Closer inspection revealed that MKSR-2 still targeted to cilia (70.1 ± 16.0% of controls, <italic>t</italic> test, P &lt; 0.0001). However, most of the protein (61.8 ± 16.4%) was now found dispersed along the axoneme, with MKSR-2 particles moving in a manner characteristic of diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201501013/DC1" id="supp4">Video 1</ext-link>). Instead of targeting MKSR-2 as expected for an upstream component in the MKS assembly pathway, CCEP-290 therefore tethers MKSR-2 to the transition zone.</p>
      <p>Examination of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> transition zone by serial-section electron microscopy reveals two prominent ultrastructural features: Y-links connecting axonemal microtubules to the ciliary membrane and the central cylinder to which axonemal outer doublet and inner singlet microtubules are attached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Perkins et al., 1986</xref>). Tomographic reconstructions show both structures to be contiguous along the longitudinal axis of the transition zone, forming elongated sheets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201501013/DC1" id="supp5">Video 2</ext-link>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Previous work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> had implicated MKS and NPHP proteins in assembly of Y-links. Loss of these connectors results in detachment and dilation of the ciliary membrane, while leaving the central cylinder and associated axonemal microtubules intact (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). The same role had been ascribed to CEP290 in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, although Y-links were still observed, albeit rarely, in <italic>cep290</italic> mutants (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Craige et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, loss of CCEP-290 in <italic>C. elegans ccep-290Δ</italic> mutants resulted in fragmentation of the central cylinder, disrupting the radially symmetric array of axonemal microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). Unlike in MKS/NPHP mutants, there was no detachment of the ciliary membrane and Y-links could still be found in some sections (arrowheads). <italic>ccep-290Δ;nphp-4</italic> mutants displayed an intermediate phenotype, with 5/11 transition zones appearing fragmented and the remainder fully disorganized. Finally, disruption of all three modules in <italic>ccep-290;mksr-2;nphp-4</italic> triple mutants resulted in a complete loss of transition zone structures, with axonemal microtubule doublets dissociated from each other and the ciliary membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). These results are consistent with our high-resolution localization data and highlight the distinct roles of CCEP-290 and MKS/NPHP proteins at the transition zone, with CCEP-290 serving as a core component of the central cylinder, which appears to act as an inner scaffold for transition zone assembly, while MKS/NPHP proteins function in assembly of peripheral Y-links.</p>
      <p>We next examined the consequences of transition zone perturbations on cilia assembly. A commonly used method to assess cilia integrity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is the dye-fill assay, which monitors uptake of the lipophilic dye DiI (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Inglis et al., 2007</xref>). This dye is taken up by a subset of ciliated neurons (12 amphid neurons in the head, 4 phasmid neurons in the tail) through their exposed ciliated endings and accumulates in their cell bodies. Defective dye-filling (Dyf) is often indicative of compromised cilia structure. As previously reported for other transition zone mutants (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), <italic>ccep-290</italic> mutants individually did not display significant dye-fill defects. However, double mutants with either <italic>nphp-1</italic> or <italic>nphp-4</italic> were strongly Dyf. In contrast, no genetic interactions were detected with <italic>mksr-2</italic>. Dye-filling was restored by expression of the appropriate GFP transgene, confirming specificity of the mutant phenotypes and functionality of our GFP reporters (Fig. S1 H; Fig. S2, D and E; and not depicted). These results would appear to support a role for the transition zone in cilia assembly. However, direct visualization of phasmid cilia using the IFT marker CHE-11:GFP failed to reveal any major defects. Most strikingly, ∼83% of cilia were found to remain in <italic>ccep-290;mksr-2;nphp-4</italic> triple mutants in which all three transition zone modules are inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Cilia lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>) and IFT rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D, E</xref>) were also largely normal. Ciliary ultrastructure was also unaffected with the exception of occasional displaced doublet microtubules, likely reflecting disorganization within the transition zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). We conclude that loss of transition zone structures has only mild effects on axoneme assembly and organization in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

      <p>While cilia assembly was largely unaffected in transition zone mutants, neuronal morphology was strongly perturbed. This was most clearly seen in phasmids, where dendrites collapsed almost entirely, with cilia found immediately adjacent to the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). This phenomenon was previously reported in certain combinations of transition zone mutants (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Loss of contact with the external environment rather than ciliogenesis defects could explain the observed lack of dye-filling, and dendrite lengths do correlate with dye-fill phenotypes (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3 C</xref> and S2 E).

      <p>Dendrite extension in amphids has been shown to occur by retrograde extension, whereby the cell body migrates backward while the dendritic tip remains anchored in place (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Heiman and Shaham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201501013/DC1" id="supp8">Video 3</ext-link>). Failure of dendrite extension in transition zone mutants could reflect a failure of cell migration or dendrite anchorage. The stochastic nature of the phenotype and bilaterally symmetric organization of phasmids allowed us to distinguish between these possibilities. In cases where one set of phasmids displayed collapsed dendrites, their cell bodies were positioned opposite their counterparts with normally extended dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>), indicating that cell migration occurred normally while dendrite attachment was defective. Interestingly, dendrite lengths are bimodally distributed, either normal or fully collapsed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Thus, attachment only occurs at the tip of the dendrite. If that attachment is lost, the dendrite collapses entirely.</p>
      <p>Cilia could contribute to neuronal morphology in a variety of ways, including by signaling. However, dendrite extension occurs before cilia are fully formed (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fujiwara et al., 1999</xref>) and was normal in IFT mutants in which axoneme assembly was inhibited (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Snow et al., 2004</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201501013/DC1" id="supp9">Fig. S3 H</ext-link>). Because signaling requires an intact cilium, this would support a direct anchoring role rather than an indirect signaling one, mediated by some structure at the ciliary base. A unique feature of <italic>C. elegans</italic> is that centrioles degenerate early during ciliogenesis (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dammermann et al., 2009</xref>) and do not persist at the base of mature cilia (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Perkins et al., 1986</xref>). While transition zone proteins are present at the time of dendrite elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>), centriole degeneration is well underway at this time (Fig. S3 I), making it unlikely that centrioles or centrosomes contribute to dendrite anchorage. Finally, loss of the basal body protein HYLS-1 only mildly perturbed dendrite extension in a manner synergistic with loss of NPHP-4 (Fig. S3 H), likely reflecting transition zone disorganization in <italic>hyls-1</italic> mutants. Our results are therefore most consistent with a direct anchoring function mediated by the transition zone.</p>
      <p>Dendrite extension in PQR neurons has been reported to occur in the canonical, anterograde manner by growth cone crawling (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kirszenblat et al., 2011</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that dendrites in PQR neurons are unaffected (Fig. S3, E and F). In contrast, both amphid and phasmid dendrites form by retrograde extension. Why the more severe phenotype in phasmids? We speculate that this is due to cooperativity in attachment between neurons sharing the same channel. Indeed, dendrites of the two neurons sharing each phasmid channel always succeeded or failed to extend together, whereas there was no correlation between dendrite extension on the left and right sides of the animal (65% displayed collapsed dendrites on the left; 63% on the right; 41% both sides, the expected probability for two independent events; <italic>n</italic> = 46 animals). With 13 transition zones per amphid compared with two per phasmid, cooperative attachment could make amphid dendrites more resistant to collapse. Differences in cell morphology may also contribute. It is notable in this context that failure of dendrite extension in phasmids, unlike in amphids (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Heiman and Shaham, 2009</xref>), is not accompanied by failure of sheath glia extension (Fig. S3 G).</p>
      <p>For a structure at the dendritic tip to provide anchorage during retrograde extension, it must interact with neighboring cells or other immobile structures. For amphids, that structure is the extracellular matrix, composed in part of the tectorin-related proteins DEX-1 and DYF-7. Loss of either protein results in loss of anchorage and dendrite collapse (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Heiman and Shaham, 2009</xref>). This was also true for the strong loss-of-function mutant <italic>dyf-7(m537)</italic> in phasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>), indicating that dendrites are secured to the extracellular material as in amphids. This adhesive matrix remains in place in transition zone mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>). If transition zones and tectorins function together in cell adhesion, we should be able to observe genetic interactions between mutants in both structures. Indeed, hypomorphic mutants of <italic>dex-1</italic> and <italic>dyf-7</italic> were found to synergize with mutations in <italic>nphp-4</italic>, which alone do not result in dendrite phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and F</xref>). Thus, transition zones mediate dendrite attachment via interactions with the extracellular matrix.</p>
      <p>In summary, our work has helped clarify the molecular architecture and function of the ciliary transition zone (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). By combining perturbation of CCEP-290, which affects the central cylinder, with previously described perturbations that affect the Y-links (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2011</xref>), we were able to completely disrupt transition zone structure. Our finding, that axoneme assembly remains relatively normal when the transition zone is lost, argues that there is no fundamental requirement for the transition zone in axoneme assembly. The picture has been less clear in vertebrates, where loss of transition zone components has been reported to result in ciliary defects in some tissues but not others (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Gonzalo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Sang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chih et al., 2012</xref>). One possible explanation for this context dependence is that it relates to transition zone function in ciliary gating (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Craige et al., 2010</xref>). Perturbed entry of ciliary components could affect cilia assembly in some cases but not others. Alternatively, loss or impairment of transition zone structures could affect cilia stability. As previously shown for basal bodies in <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bayless et al., 2012</xref>), cilia motility or fluid flow over nonmotile cilia results in mechanical stresses that could damage cilia unless stabilized by structures at their base. In less challenging environments, such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> cilia protected inside the cuticle of the worm, impaired stability might have less deleterious consequences.</p>

Based on protein localization and mutant phenotypes, CCEP-290 is an essential component of the central cylinder (this study), whereas MKS and NPHP module components function in assembly of Y-links (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2011</xref>).

      </fig>
      <p>A second major conclusion of our work is that the transition zone is required for adhesion to the extracellular matrix to allow dendrite extension. While cilia have not previously been implicated in cell adhesion, signs of crosstalk have been observed for many years. Thus, NPHP proteins localize to cell–cell and cell–matrix junctions (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Benzing et al., 2001</xref>) and have been found to be required for epithelial morphogenesis (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Delous et al., 2009</xref>). Conversely, junctional proteins have been found at cilia (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Sfakianos et al., 2007</xref>). Cilia have been linked to many developmental processes in vertebrates and we speculate that cilia-mediated adhesion contributes to some of these processes. For example, during development of the cerebral cortex, delamination of neural precursors from the apical adherens belt is an important determinant of cell fate. These precursors are ciliated, and it has been shown that the position of the primary cilium determines whether a daughter cell delaminates after mitosis (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Wilsch-Bräuninger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Paridaen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Importantly, cilia repositioning precedes any change in polarity and is therefore the driving force behind loss of attachment. While it is possible that cilia-dependent signaling underlies this phenomenon, we suggest an alternative explanation: a direct, mechanical role for the cilium in cell adhesion. As in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, analysis of IFT mutants (impairing cilia-dependent signaling but not transition zone function) could distinguish between these possibilities.</p>

Transgenic strains expressing fluorescently tagged CCEP-290, HYLS-1, MKSR-2, and NPHP-4 were generated by cloning the corresponding genomic loci, including 5′ and 3′ regulatory sequences and N-terminal LAP-GFP/mCherry into the appropriate targeting vector and Mos1-mediated transposition (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Frøkjaer-Jensen et al., 2008</xref>). Strains expressing GFP:CCEP-290, DYF-7:GFP, MKS-2:GFP, MKS-6:GFP, MKSR-1:GFP, and Pnas-31:mCherry/OSM-6:GFP from extrachromosomal arrays were generated by coinjection with the marker plasmid pRF4. All strains were maintained at 23°C.</p>

        <title>Immunofluorescence and fixed imaging</title>
        <p>Immunofluorescence experiments were performed as described previously (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Oegema et al., 2001</xref>) using Cy3/Cy5-labeled affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against HYLS-1 (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dammermann et al., 2009</xref>) and SAS-4 (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dammermann et al., 2004</xref>), as well as unlabeled mouse monoclonal antibodies against polyglutamylated tubulin (GT335; provided by C. Janke, Institut Curie, Paris, France). Residual fluorescence signal was used to detect GFP/mCherry-tagged protein in fixed embryos. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against S-peptide (MA1-981; Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used to detect LAP-tagged CCEP-290 in embryos also expressing other GFP fusions. In brief, worms were permeabilized by freeze crack, fixed in −20°C methanol for 20 min, rehydrated in PBS, blocked for 20 min in AbDil (PBS, 2% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100), incubated with primary antibodies (1 µg/ml HYLS-1/SAS-4/MA1-981, 4 µg/ml GT335) in AbDil for 1.5 h, washed with PBST (PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100), incubated with secondary antibodies (15 µg/ml Cy2/Cy3/Cy5-labeled donkey anti-mouse antibody; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) in AbDil for 1 h, washed with PBST, and incubated with 1 µg/ml Hoechst 33342 in PBS for 5 min before mounting in 0.5% p-phenylenediamine, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.8, and 90% glycerol. 3D wide-field datasets were acquired using a 100× 1.4 NA Super Plan-Apochromat lens on a microscope (DeltaVision; Applied Precision) equipped with a 7-Color SSI module and a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (CoolSNAP-HQ2; Photometrics), computationally deconvolved using the enhanced ratio constrained iterative deconvolution algorithm, and maximum-intensity projected in SoftWorx (Applied Precision), before being imported into Photoshop (Adobe) for panel preparation. No nonlinear gamma corrections were performed during image processing.</p>

        <title>Live imaging</title>
        <p>Where possible, worms expressing fluorescent markers were examined without fixation, anaesthetized with 10 mM tetramisole, and mounted on 2% agarose pads. Imaging was performed at room temperature on the set-up described above. For examination of neuronal morphology and localization interdependencies, 3D wide-field datasets were acquired, deconvolved, and processed as described above. Exposure conditions and scaling were kept constant when comparing signal across mutant backgrounds. At least 10 animals were examined per condition. Dendrite lengths (from cell body to ciliary base) and cilia dimensions (base to tip) were measured in MetaMorph on strains expressing CHE-11:GFP. For examination of protein localization at high spatial resolution, L4 larvae coexpressing GFP-tagged transition zone proteins and mCherry:HYLS-1 were imaged with the additional use of a 1.6× optovar, and deconvolved image stacks were analyzed in MetaMorph. Where phasmid cilia lay flat within the image plane, the dimensions of GFP and mCherry signals were measured using the linescan function and averaged over &gt;20 cilia per strain. Potential shifts between GFP and mCherry signals due to chromatic aberration were excluded by imaging a strain coexpressing the same protein in both colors. For time-lapse imaging of neurite extension, single-plane GFP and transmitted light images were acquired every 2 min in embryos expressing myristoylated GFP under a pan-neuronal promoter, using low-power LED illumination to avoid photodamage. For analysis of IFT and GFP:MKSR-2 trafficking in <italic>ccep-290Δ</italic> mutants, single-plane GFP images of phasmid cilia in L4 larvae were acquired every second. Anterograde movement rates for the middle segment were determined by single-particle tracking in MetaMorph (<italic>n</italic> = 40–140 particles per strain). Kymographs along the ciliary axis were similarly generated in MetaMorph.</p>

        <p>L4-stage worms were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/liter sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, overnight at 4°C. Samples were postfixed in 0.5–2% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer, washed in ddH<sub>2</sub>O, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in Agar100 resin. 70-nm serial sections were poststained with aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Morgagni 268D microscope (FEI) equipped with an 11-megapixel Morada CCD camera (Olympus-SIS) and operated at 80 kV. At least five animals were examined per condition. For electron tomography, 200-nm sections were examined with a microscope (Tecnai G2 20; FEI) equipped with a CCD camera (Eagle 4k HS; FEI) and operated at 200 kV. Single axis tilt series were acquired using SerialEM (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>) by stepwise tilting the sample on average from −60° to +60° in 1° increments. Tomogram reconstruction with 10-nm gold beads as fiducials and model generation was performed using the IMOD software package (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>).</p>

    <p>Cdk1 and regulatory proteins such as cyclin B1, Plk1, and Aurora A cooperate to initiate mitosis. To exit mitosis, cells destroy the regulatory proteins, an effect triggered by the APC/C when it is bound to its coactivator Cdh1. Cdk1 adds phosphates to Cdh1 that prevent it from attaching to the APC/C, but the phosphatase Cdc14B removes them. Cdh1, Cdc14B, and the components of the APC/C are present at the centrosome, but it is unclear how cells rein in Cdc14B activity during early mitosis to prevent premature activation of the APC/C-Cdh1 combo.</p>
    <p>Lim et al. discovered that hydrogen peroxide helps control Cdc14B activity. The amount of hydrogen peroxide in a cell starts to rise as it enters G2, but the researchers found that an enzyme called peroxiredoxin I shelters the centrosome. Cells phophorylated and inactivated peroxiredoxin I near the beginning of mitosis, causing a surge in hydrogen peroxide around the centrosome that spurred mitotic progression. Targeting an enzyme that neutralizes hydrogen peroxide to the centrosome delayed cells’ entry into mitosis.</p>
    <p>The rise in hydrogen peroxide at the centrosome shut down phosphatases such as Cdc14B, allowing phosphorylation of Cdh1 and inactivation of the APC/C. Later in mitosis, phosphatases PP1 and PP2A stepped in to dephosphorylate and reactivate peroxiredoxin I, cutting hydrogen peroxide levels and allowing the APC/C to begin its work.</p>

        <p>Reversible oxidative inactivation of centrosome-bound protein phosphatases such as Cdc14B by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is likely responsible for the inhibition of Cdk1-opposing phosphatases during early mitosis, which prevents premature degradation of mitotic activators.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Proteins associated with the centrosome play key roles in mitotic progression in mammalian cells. The activity of Cdk1-opposing phosphatases at the centrosome must be inhibited during early mitosis to prevent premature dephosphorylation of Cdh1—an activator of the ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome—and the consequent premature degradation of mitotic activators. In this paper, we show that reversible oxidative inactivation of centrosome-bound protein phosphatases such as Cdc14B by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is likely responsible for this inhibition. The intracellular concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increases as the cell cycle progresses. Whereas the centrosome is shielded from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> through its association with the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-eliminating enzyme peroxiredoxin I (PrxI) during interphase, the centrosome-associated PrxI is selectively inactivated through phosphorylation by Cdk1 during early mitosis, thereby exposing the centrosome to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and facilitating inactivation of centrosome-bound phosphatases. Dephosphorylation of PrxI by okadaic acid–sensitive phosphatases during late mitosis again shields the centrosome from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and thereby allows the reactivation of Cdk1-opposing phosphatases at the organelle.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Activation of the Cdk1–cyclin B complex occurs first at the centrosome during prophase, and its amplification through multiple feedback loops involving cyclin B, Cdc25B, Cdc25C, Plk, and Aurora A also occurs at this organelle (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Jackman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bonnet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lindqvist et al., 2009</xref>). Successful cell cycle progression requires that many cell cycle regulators—including cyclins A and B, Plk1, and Aurora A—be degraded in a timely manner. Degradation of these regulators by the 26S proteasome results from their ubiquitination by the multisubunit ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Activation of APC/C occurs at the centrosome and requires Cdc20 or Cdh1 as an activator protein (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Peters, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Pesin and Orr-Weaver, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">van Leuken et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wurzenberger and Gerlich, 2011</xref>). Cdh1 is prevented from interaction with APC/C when Cdh1 is phosphorylated by Cdks. APC/C–Cdh1 activity thus depends on both Cdks as well as Cdk-opposing phosphatases. The dual-specificity protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), Cdc14B, and the Ser/Thr phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A, have been proposed to function as Cdk1-opposing enzymes in mammalian cells (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bassermann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Mochida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Mocciaro and Schiebel, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Schmitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Domingo-Sananes et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>A fraction of each of APC/C, Cdc20, Cdh1, and Cdk1-opposing phosphatases (Cdc14B, PP1, and PP2A) is present at the centrosome (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Leach et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Peters, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Schmitz et al., 2010</xref>), as are Cdk1, Cdc25, cyclin B, Plk1, and Aurora A. At the onset of mitosis, Cdk1–cyclin B activity begins to increase as a result of positive feedback loops including cyclin B, Cdc25, Plk1, and Aurora A. The low level of incipient Cdk1 activity is likely insufficient to allow the accumulation of phosphorylated Cdh1 at the centrosome in the absence of concurrent suppression of the activity of Cdk1-opposing phosphatases, which, together with Cdh1, are enriched at this organelle. In the absence of such suppression of centrosomal phosphatase activity, further activation of Cdk1 would not be expected to occur because of the premature degradation of cyclin B, Plk1, and Aurora A.</p>
      <p>Here, we find that the centrosomal levels of cyclin B, Plk1, and Aurora A as well as mitotic entry are likely regulated by the local concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> around the centrosome. We were led into this study by our previous observation that PrxI is inactivated when phosphorylated on Thr<sup>90</sup> by purified Cdk1–cyclin B (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2002</xref>). Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are a major class of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-eliminating enzymes (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Rhee et al., 2012</xref>). Mammalian cells express six Prx isoforms (PrxI to PrxVI), which are implicated in a variety of cellular processes.</p>

        <title>Phosphorylation of centrosome-associated PrxI in early mitotic cells</title>
        <p>Whereas high H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels induce cell cycle arrest, low H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels are required for G<sub>1</sub>–S and G<sub>2</sub>–M phase transitions (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Havens et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Yamaura et al., 2009</xref>). The molecular mechanisms by which H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> modulates cell cycle progression have remained unclear, however. To examine the possible link between the role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in cell cycle regulation and PrxI phosphorylation on Thr<sup>90</sup>, we monitored this latter event during the cell cycle in HeLa cells that had been synchronized at the G<sub>1</sub>–S border (0 h) with a double thymidine block and then released for various times. Phosphorylated PrxI (pPrxI) appeared slightly earlier than did the mitotic marker phosphorylated histone H3 (pHH3), and it disappeared in parallel with pHH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). When HeLa or U2OS cells arrested in prometaphase with nocodazole were released from the arrest, pPrxI disappeared rapidly, with the rate of its loss being slightly greater than that for cyclin B1 or pHH3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201412068/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>).</p>

        <p>The amount of pPrxI in prometaphase HeLa cells was estimated to be ∼0.4% of total PrxI (Fig. S1 B). We therefore reasoned that PrxI phosphorylation is likely a localized event, and we searched for its location in asynchronously growing HeLa cells using confocal microscopy. pPrxI was found to colocalize with the centrosome marker γ-tubulin at early stages of mitosis (prometaphase and metaphase) but not during interphase or late mitotic stages (anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The centrosome is composed of a pair of centrioles surrounded by pericentriolar material. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>) revealed that although pPrxI is colocalized with Cep192, a pericentriolar material marker of mitotic cells (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>), there are also regions of Cep192 that do not exhibit pPrxI. This may reflect unphosphorylated PrxI, although this remains to be verified. Release of HeLa cells from G<sub>1</sub>–S arrest revealed that pPrxI was present at early and late prophase, prometaphase, and metaphase, but not during G<sub>2</sub>, anaphase, telophase, or cytokinesis (Fig. S1 C). The appearance of pPrxI specifically at mitotic centrosomes was also detected in A431 and MCF7 cells (Fig. S1 D). The specificity of the antibodies to pPrxI was demonstrated using PrxI-deficient cells (Fig. S1, E and F). The centrosome-specific localization of pPrxI was also shown using biochemically isolated centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>).

        <p>To examine the effect of exposure of the centrosome to cytoplasmic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which would be expected to occur as a result of PrxI phosphorylation (inactivation), we infected HeLa cells with a retroviral vector encoding a modified form of catalase either with a centrosome-targeting pericentrin-AKAP450 centrosomal targeting (PACT) sequence (Cat-PACT) or with the corresponding sequence lacking the centrosome-targeting core (Cat-delPACT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gillingham and Munro, 2000</xref>). The presence of Cat-PACT and the absence of Cat-delPACT at the centrosome were verified by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). HeLa cells that had been infected with the empty, Cat-PACT, or Cat-delPACT vectors were synchronized at G<sub>1</sub>–S by thymidine treatment and released in the presence of nocodazole for 10 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Early mitotic cells were scored on the basis of cell rounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>) and chromosome condensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). The number of mitotic cells (mean of values from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>) for cells expressing Cat-PACT was reduced by ∼45% and ∼35% compared with that for cells infected with the empty vector or the vector encoding Cat-delPACT, respectively. Immunoblot analysis of the infected HeLa cells showed that the level of inactive (Tyr<sup>15</sup> phosphorylated) Cdk1 in Cat-PACT cells was about twice that in Cat-delPACT cells and that the level of pHH3 in Cat-PACT cells was ∼50% of that in Cat-delPACT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>). Such analysis also revealed that Cat-PACT and Cat-delPACT were expressed stably at low levels relative to endogenous peroxisomal catalase, suggesting that any effect of Cat-PACT present in the cytosol instead of at the centrosome as a result of excessive expression was minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). We also monitored mitotic entry by fluorescence imaging of live cells after the release of Cat-PACT and Cat-delPACT cells from G<sub>1</sub>–S arrest. Mitotic entry of Cat-PACT cells was delayed by a mean of ∼2–3 h compared with that of Cat-delPACT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201412068/DC1" id="supp2">Videos 1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201412068/DC1" id="supp3">2</ext-link>).

        <title>Mitotic exit phosphatase Cdc14B, but not entry phosphatases Cdc25B and Cdc25C, is sensitive to oxidative inactivation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></title>
        <p>The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a signaling molecule that regulates various biological processes has been well established. The best characterized H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> effectors are members of the PTP family such as PTP1B and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), which are reversibly inactivated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced in various cells stimulated with growth factors (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Tonks, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Rhee, 2006</xref>). The redox sensitivity of these enzymes is attributable to a low-p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> cysteine residue located within the PTP signature motif (HCX<sub>5</sub>R). Although PTP1B, PTEN, and Cdc14 act on distinct substrates, they are structurally closely related, whereas Cdc25 phosphatases have a different structure, which is similar to that of rhodanese (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mustelin, 2007</xref>).</p>
        <p>Oxidation of PTEN renders its structure more compact as a result of the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond, with the oxidized protein migrating faster than the reduced form during nonreducing SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al., 2004</xref>). Like PTEN, Myc-tagged Cdc14B showed a reversible H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced increase in electrophoretic mobility under nonreducing conditions when tested using HeLa cells expressing Myc-tagged Cdc14B (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201412068/DC1" id="supp6">Fig. S2, A and B</ext-link>), whereas no such mobility shift was observed with Myc-tagged forms of Cdc25B or Cdc25C (Fig. S2 B). Cdc14B appeared to be more sensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than was PTEN (Fig. S2 B). Human Cdc14B contains nine Cys residues in addition to the catalytic Cys<sup>314</sup>. Analysis of various Cys mutants of Cdc14B showed that only Cys<sup>228</sup> and Cys<sup>314</sup> among the 10 Cys residues are required for the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent mobility shift (Fig. S2 C), suggesting that oxidized Cys<sup>314</sup> forms a disulfide bond with Cys<sup>228</sup>.</p>
        <p>Although oxidation of Cys residues does not necessarily result in a gel mobility shift, oxidized Cys can be reliably detected by alkylation of reduced Cys residues followed by reduction of the oxidized cysteines and subsequent biotinylation of the newly formed thiols. We applied the biotinylation method to the cells that had been exposed to exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> maintained at low micromolar levels by incubation of cells with glucose and glucose oxidase. Such analysis also revealed that Cdc14B and PTEN, but not Cdc25B and Cdc25C, are sensitive to oxidation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Fig. S2 D). Collectively, these results suggested that centrosomal Cdc14B might be oxidatively inactivated during early mitosis. Direct evaluation of the oxidation status of centrosomal Cdc14B at different stages of the cell cycle was not possible because biochemical isolation of the centrosome requires treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2008</xref>), which would reduce the disulfide bond of oxidized Cdc14B. The redox sensitivity of PP1 and PP2, which contain a redox-sensitive bimetallic center, has also long been described (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Rusnak and Reiter, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pieri et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al., 2009</xref>).

        <title>Effect of pericentrosomal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on the extent of Cdh1 phosphorylation</title>
        <p>The activation of APC/C–Cdh1 has been proposed to occur initially at the centrosome (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Raff et al., 2002</xref>). Our results suggested that PrxI phosphorylation at the onset of mitosis might give rise to a series of events including an increase in the pericentrosomal concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, inactivation of Cdk1-opposing phosphatases and accumulation of phosphorylated Cdh1. To test this hypothesis, we produced rabbit antibodies to the Ser<sup>40</sup>-phosphorylated form of human Cdh1 (pCdh1). Phosphorylation of Cdh1 is known to occur at as many as 8–11 sites in yeast, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, and mammalian cells (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Jaspersen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al., 2000</xref>). All of these potential Cdk phosphorylation sites were identified indirectly with the use of site-directed mutants. Among them, the amino acid sequence surrounding Ser<sup>40</sup> in human Cdh1 is best conserved (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201412068/DC1" id="supp7">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>). The specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated using Cdh1 phosphorylated by recombinant Cdk1–cyclin B (Fig. S3 B) and Cdh1-depleted HeLa cells (Fig. S3 C). We next examined whether Ser<sup>40</sup> phosphorylation is important for the binding of Cdh1 to APC/C. HA-tagged forms of wild-type Cdh1 or mutants thereof in which Ser<sup>40</sup> is replaced with alanine or aspartic acid (S40A or S40D, respectively) were expressed in HeLa cells, and the amount of HA-Cdh1 that coimmunoprecipitated with the APC/C complex was estimated in nocodazole-arrested cells. The amount of coprecipitated S40D (phosphomimetic mutant) was only ∼30% and ∼20% of that of the wild-type or S40A (nonphosphorylatable mutant) proteins, respectively (Fig. S3, D and E), suggesting that Ser<sup>40</sup> phosphorylation inhibits Cdh1 binding to APC/C.</p>
        <p>Using the antibodies to pCdh1, we investigated the effect of Cat-PACT expression on Ser<sup>40</sup> phosphorylation in nocodazole-arrested cells. The amount of pCdh1 in HeLa cells expressing Cat-PACT was reduced by ∼30% compared with that in cells infected with the empty vector or expressing Cat-delPACT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>), consistent with the notion that Cdh1 phosphorylation is highly influenced by pericentrosomal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level and that pCdh1 undergoes turnover at the centrosome (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Raff et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

        <p>The role of PP1 and PP2A in determining the phosphorylation state of PrxI and Cdh1 was tested in HeLa cells treated with okadaic acid (OA), a potent inhibitor of these phosphatases or silenced for both PP1 and PP2A. The abundance of both pPrxI and pCdh1 was increased by OA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>) or by silencing PP1 and PP2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>), indicating that phosphorylation of PrxI and Cdh1 by Cdk1 is reversed by PP1 and PP2A. Given that Cdc14B is highly concentrated at the centrosome, it is also possible that the OA effect on Cdh1 phosphorylation was mediated indirectly through the inactivation of Cdc14B by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> that accumulates around the centrosome as a result of PrxI phosphorylation. As observed before (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Picard et al., 1989</xref>), OA also promoted mitotic entry as indicated by an increase in the abundance of pHH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>).</p>
        <p>A series of events that are proposed to occur at the centrosome in connection to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>, beginning with PrxI phosphorylation. Whereas the intracellular concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increases as the cell cycle progresses to G<sub>2</sub> phase, the centrosome is shielded from the high tide of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by the peroxidase activity of PrxI associated with the organelle. At the onset of mitosis, Cdk1–cyclin B phosphorylates PrxI, which results in exposure of the centrosome to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and consequent inactivation of Cdk1-opposing phosphatases represented by Cdc14B. Among the many Cdk1-phosphorylated proteins in mammalian cells, at least pCdh1 appears to be a substrate of Cdc14B in vitro and in vivo (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bassermann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Schindler and Schultz, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Mocciaro and Schiebel, 2010</xref>). In late mitosis, PrxI is dephosphorylated, and the centrosome is consequently again shielded from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, allowing sequential reactivation of phosphatases, dephosphorylation of Cdh1, and activation of APC/C-Cdh1. This newly discovered circuit provides a means to integrate input from diverse H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-generating cellular processes. The presence of PrxI at the centrosome might also serve as a safeguard to prevent unscheduled mitotic entry as a result of an accidental increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> abundance.</p>

The cells were then transferred to fresh medium, and samples were harvested every 1–3 h. For arrest in prometaphase, HeLa cells were treated with 2 mM thymidine for 18 h, released into fresh medium for 3 h, and treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 h. The cells were then collected every 0.5–2 h after their transfer to fresh medium. MEFs were synchronized as described previously (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">García-Higuera et al., 2008</xref>), with some modifications. In brief, cells were arrested in G<sub>0</sub> by serum deprivation (0.5% FBS) for 72 h, released in medium containing 10% serum, and in the presence of 0.2 µg/ml aphidicolin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h for G<sub>1</sub>–S synchronization, and then treated with 500 ng/ml nocodazole and 5 µM paclitaxel (Sigma-Aldrich) for 12 h for mitotic synchronization.</p>

        <p>A full-length Cdc14B cDNA was amplified by PCR from a human testis cDNA library (Takara Bio Inc.). The sequences of PCR primers for the first and second reactions were 5′-CCCCCTGACGGGCCGC-3′ (first, forward), 5′-TTCCTTCAGCTCTGGTCACA-3′ (first, reverse), 5′-AATTGGCCGGCCCATGAAGCGGAAAAGCGAGC-3′ (second, forward), and 5′-ATATGGCGCGCCTTAACGCAAGACTCTTTTAGTC-3′ (second, reverse). The amplified coding region was then cloned into the Fse1 and Asc1 sites of the pCS2-Myc vector (cytomegalovirus promoter, 6 Myc epitope; provided by D. Turner, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) for expression of a Myc epitope–tagged protein. Point mutations of Cdc14B were generated with the use of a QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) with pCS2-Myc-Cdc14B as the template. The plasmids pCS2-HA-Cdh1(S40A) and pCS2-HA-Cdh1(S40D) were constructed with the same kit and with pCS2-HA-Cdh1 as the template. Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotides for PrxI and Cdh1 were synthesized by GE Healthcare and were previously validated (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2011</xref>); the target sequences are 5′-AAACTCAACTGCCAAGTGATT-3′ and 5′-CGCTTGTCTGAGGATTACG-3′ for PrxI and 5′-GGAACACGCTGACAGGACA-3′ (siCdh1-1) and 5′-GAAGAAGGGTCTGTTCACG-3′ (siCdh1-2) for Cdh1. A control siRNA for GFP (5′-GTTCAGCGTGTCCGGCGAGTT-3′) was obtained from Samchully Pharma. Pan-PP1 siRNA (for the α, β, and γ isoforms; sc-43545) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotides for PP2A-Cα and PP2A-Cβ were synthesized from GE Healthcare. SMARTpool siRNA target sequences consist of four siRNA targeting multiple sites on PP2A-Cα and PP2A-Cβ.

In brief, cells (10<sup>6</sup> per 100-mm dish) exposed to glucose oxidase in high-glucose medium were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped into 1 ml of the same solution, transferred to a microfuge tube, isolated by centrifugation at 8,000 <italic>g</italic> for 1 min at 4°C, and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1 ml of oxygen-free extraction buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NEM, 10 mM iodoacetic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM NaF, 50 µg/ml leupeptin, 50 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-sulfonyl fluoride) in an anaerobic chamber. The samples were then centrifuged, SDS was added to the harvested supernatants to a final concentration of 1%, and the mixtures were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. 500-µg portions of the denatured proteins were precipitated by the addition of TCA to a final concentration of 10% and incubation for 1 h at room temperature. The precipitates were washed twice with acetone that had been cooled on dry ice and were then reduced by incubation for 30 min at 50°C in 0.1 ml of oxygen-free reducing buffer (50 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.7, 1 mM EDTA, 2% SDS, and 4 mM DTT) in an anaerobic chamber. The reduced proteins containing free sulfhydryl groups were biotinylated by incubation for 30 min at 50°C with 0.9 ml of a solution containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM biotin that had been conjugated to polyethylene oxide–maleimide (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The reaction was stopped by the addition of DTT to a final concentration of 1 mM, and proteins were precipitated by incubation with TCA at a final concentration of 10% for 1 h. The precipitates were washed with dry ice–chilled acetone and then solubilized in 0.2 ml of a solution containing 50 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.7, 1 mM EDTA, and 2% SDS, with ultrasonic treatment for 15 s.

The remaining 360-µl portion of each mixture was diluted further with the same solution without SDS until the final concentration of SDS was 0.5%. Biotinylated proteins were then precipitated by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with 3 µl of packed UltraLink Immobilized NeutrAvidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The beads were washed five times with a solution containing 20 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.7, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5% SDS, and the biotinylated proteins were released from the beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to Cdc14B.

        <p>Reversible depletion of centrioles uncovers a p53-dependent pathway that protects against genome instability following centriole duplication failure.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Centriole function has been difficult to study because of a lack of specific tools that allow persistent and reversible centriole depletion. Here we combined gene targeting with an auxin-inducible degradation system to achieve rapid, titratable, and reversible control of Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4), a master regulator of centriole biogenesis. Depletion of Plk4 led to a failure of centriole duplication that produced an irreversible cell cycle arrest within a few divisions. This arrest was not a result of a prolonged mitosis, chromosome segregation errors, or cytokinesis failure. Depleting p53 allowed cells that fail centriole duplication to proliferate indefinitely. Washout of auxin and restoration of endogenous Plk4 levels in cells that lack centrioles led to the penetrant formation of de novo centrioles that gained the ability to organize microtubules and duplicate. In summary, we uncover a p53-dependent surveillance mechanism that protects against genome instability by preventing cell growth after centriole duplication failure.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s01"><title>Introduction</title><p>Centrosomes are the main microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) of most animal cells and are composed of a pair of centrioles surrounded by pericentriolar material (PCM; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gönczy, 2012</xref>). Centrioles act as the centrosome organizer and thus their duplication controls centrosome number. Like DNA, centrioles duplicate exactly once per cell cycle, with a single new procentriole forming on the wall of each existing centriole (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Tsou and Stearns, 2006</xref>). This tightly controlled process ensures the generation of two centrosomes to form the poles of the bipolar mitotic spindle. Errors in centriole duplication lead to abnormal centrosome number, which can result in chromosome segregation errors and the production of aneuploid progeny (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ganem et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Silkworth et al., 2009</xref>). Aberrations in centrosome number have been associated with several human diseases, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Canonical centriole duplication begins at the G1/S transition with the assembly of a single cartwheel structure on the wall of each preexisting mother centriole. The cartwheel then templates the formation of a procentriole by providing a scaffold onto which microtubules are loaded (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kitagawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">van Breugel et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In addition to this canonical pathway of centriole assembly, de novo centriole formation can occur in the absence of existing centrioles (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Miki-Noumura, 1977</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Szöllosi and Ozil, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Palazzo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Marshall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Suh et al., 2002</xref>). A striking example of this process occurs in mouse embryos, where cell divisions continue in the absence of centrioles until the 64-cell stage, at which point centrioles are created de novo (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Szollosi et al., 1972</xref>). In vertebrate somatic cells, a variable number of de novo centrioles are generated after experimental removal of existing centrioles (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Khodjakov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">La Terra et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Uetake et al., 2007</xref>). It is therefore thought that existing centrioles act to suppress de novo centriole assembly, although the molecular mechanism for this suppression remains unclear.</p><p>Previous approaches to study the immediate consequence of centriole loss in human cells have relied on laser ablation or microsurgery (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Khodjakov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">La Terra et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Uetake et al., 2007</xref>). These elegant approaches only transiently remove centrioles from a small number of cells. Permanent centriole loss has been achieved through the knockout of essential centriole components (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Sir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bazzi and Anderson, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Izquierdo et al., 2014</xref>). Although informative, these studies did not address the immediate effects of centriole duplication failure and were unable to temporally control formation of new centrioles.</p><p>Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) has emerged as a conserved, dose-dependent regulator of centriole copy number and offers an attractive target to reversibly modulate centriole number in populations of cells (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Habedanck et al., 2005</xref>). Plk4 is a self-regulating enzyme that phosphorylates itself to promote its own destruction (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cunha-Ferreira et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Guderian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Holland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Brownlee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Klebba et al., 2013</xref>). This autoregulated destruction plays an important role in controlling the abundance of endogenous Plk4 and thereby helps to limit centriole duplication to once per cell cycle (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Holland et al., 2012b</xref>). RNA interference and knock-in approaches have been used to inhibit Plk4 function, but these strategies are slow acting and are not readily reversible. Inhibition of Plk4 kinase activity offers a powerful alternative to manipulate Plk4 function. However, specific kinase inhibitors are difficult to develop (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Holland and Cleveland, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Mason et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, inhibiting Plk4 activity greatly increases protein abundance, making it challenging to dissect the relative contribution of loss of kinase activity and increased protein abundance (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Holland et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we developed a chemical genetics approach to rapidly and reversibly control Plk4 protein abundance in cells. Manipulating endogenous Plk4 levels allowed the reversible depletion of centrioles from populations of cycling cells and uncovered the existence of a p53-dependent pathway that guards against genome instability by preventing cellular proliferation after centriole duplication failure. By taking advantage of the acute and titratable depletion of Plk4, our data define the threshold level of Plk4 required for centriole assembly and establish the consequence of acute Plk4 depletion on centriole composition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s02"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>A novel system for rapidly and reversibly controlling Plk4 levels</title><p>To study the immediate effects caused by Plk4 depletion, we turned to an auxin-inducible degradation system that allows for posttranslational control of protein abundance with the plant hormone auxin (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>). In plants, auxin promotes the binding of the F-box protein osTIR1 to proteins containing an auxin-inducible degron (AID). In the presence of auxin, osTIR1 recruits AID-containing substrates to the Skp1, Cullin, and F-Box ubiquitin ligase, which ubiquitinates the AID-containing protein and targets it for proteasomal degradation. Ectopic expression of osTIR1 in mammalian cells generates an SCF<sup>TIR1</sup> complex and enables auxin-inducible destruction of AID-tagged transgenes (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Holland et al., 2012a</xref>), suggesting that the AID system could also be applied to posttranslationally regulate the stability and abundance of endogenous Plk4.</p><p>We used sequential rounds of gene targeting to knock-in the AID onto the C terminus of both endogenous Plk4 alleles in nontransformed, telomerase-immortalized, human RPE-1 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201502089/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1, A and B</ext-link>). To facilitate detection, each Plk4<sup>AID</sup> allele was tagged at the C terminus with a HA or 3× FLAG tag. Two Plk4<sup>AID-HA/AID-3xFLAG</sup> (hereafter referred to as Plk4<sup>AID/AID</sup>) clones were obtained and behaved similarly in all assays. Plk4<sup>AID/AID</sup> cells exhibited normal centrosome copy number and cell cycle profiles (Fig. S1, C and D), and both Plk4<sup>AID-HA</sup> and Plk4<sup>AID-FLAG</sup> localized to the centrioles of cells in interphase and mitosis in a manner that was indistinguishable from wild-type Plk4 (Fig. S1 E). We conclude that Plk4<sup>AID</sup> is capable of supporting Plk4 function in centriole duplication.</p><p>We stably expressed osTIR1-9xMyc in Plk4<sup>AID/AID</sup> cells to place the stability of endogenous Plk4<sup>AID</sup> under the control of exogenous auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). To analyze Plk4 protein levels, we immunoprecipitated Plk4<sup>AID-3xFLAG</sup> from cell lysates using a FLAG antibody and determined the abundance of Plk4 by immunoblot. Addition of the auxin indole<italic>-</italic>3<italic>-</italic>acetic acid (IAA) to Plk4<sup>AID/AID</sup> cells led to rapid Plk4 degradation, with Plk4 falling below the limit of detection within 10 min of IAA addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The level of Plk4 at the centrosome was measured at various times after IAA addition using antibodies raised to the FLAG tag or to the C terminus of Plk4. Staining with the monoclonal FLAG antibody revealed that the level of Plk4 at the centrosomes of interphase cells declined by &gt;95% within 30 min of IAA addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>), whereas staining with a polyclonal antibody to the C terminus of Plk4 revealed a &gt;80% reduction during the same time period (Fig. S1 F). Plk4 destruction occurred in all cell cycle phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>) and required the presence of the osTIR1 F-box protein (Fig. S1 G). Importantly, the degradation of Plk4 was fully reversible, with the level of Plk4 at the centriole recovering to original levels within 3 h of IAA removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Med?><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Inducible destruction of endogenous Plk4.</bold> (A) Schematic outlining the strategy for the auxin-inducible destruction of Plk4.

Because Plk4 autoregulates its own stability, generating a progressive reduction in Plk4 protein levels is challenging, as a reduced abundance of Plk4 mRNA may not lead to a comparable down-regulation of Plk4 protein (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Holland et al., 2012a</xref>). We therefore set out to use auxin-inducible destruction to generate a graded reduction in Plk4 levels. We used quantitative microscopy with directly labeled Plk4 primary antibodies to determine the abundance of Plk4 at the centriole in cells treated with various concentrations of IAA. Exposing Plk4<sup>AID/AID</sup> cells to increasing concentrations of IAA resulted in gradual reduction in the average level of Plk4 at the centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). We examined whether centriole duplication occurred successfully with different levels of Plk4 protein. In cells treated with 1 µM IAA, the average level of Plk4 at the centrosome was 81% of that in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Under these conditions, centrioles duplicated in &gt;75% of cells. However, at 10 µM IAA, whereas centrosomal Plk4 levels were maintained at 57% of that in control cells, &lt;10% of cells underwent centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). We conclude that Plk4 levels are finely balanced and that a less than twofold reduction in the level of Plk4 at the centrosome leads to a failure of centriole duplication.</p></sec><sec id="s05"><title>The centriole localization of STIL is uniquely sensitive to the levels of Plk4</title><p>RNA interference of Plk4 leads to slow protein depletion, making it challenging to distinguish between direct and indirect effects of Plk4 removal. The ability to rapidly remove Plk4 from cells provided an opportunity to identify proteins that directly depend on Plk4 for recruitment to the centriole. We used immunofluorescence microscopy to examine the abundance of 10 proteins (CPAP, CEP135, CEP152, CEP192, SAS6, CNAP1, CEP164, Centrin, γ-tubulin, and STIL) at the centrosome 1 h after Plk4 destruction with IAA. Because the abundance of several centriole proteins are reduced after mitosis (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Strnad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Arquint et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arquint and Nigg, 2014</xref>), our measurements were made in S/G2 cells that were marked by the presence of CENP-F (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hussein and Taylor, 2002</xref>). Of the 10 proteins examined, the localization of STIL was uniquely sensitive to a reduction in Plk4 levels: the abundance of STIL at the centriole was reduced by &gt;75% 1 h after IAA addition, whereas total protein levels remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). These data are consistent with a recent study showing that Plk4 binds to STIL (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>). STIL has been proposed to recruit SAS6 to the centriole through a direct, phosphorylation-dependent interaction (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dzhindzhev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>). However, whereas STIL levels declined dramatically by 1 h after acute Plk4 destruction, we observed only a modest change in centriole SAS6 levels, suggesting STIL is not required to maintain existing SAS6 at the centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s06"><title>Cells lacking Plk4 undergo a cell cycle arrest</title><p>We next examined the chronic effect of Plk4 depletion in RPE1 cells.

Interphase Plk4<sup>AID/AID</sup> cells exhibited a dramatic reduction in centriole number by 24 h after IAA addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Centriole number decreased further by 48 h after Plk4 degradation, giving rise to 22% of cells that lack centrioles. After this time, centriole content changed only slowly, consistent with the fact that the vast majority of cells cease proliferating by 48 h after IAA addition.</p><fig id="fig3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Med?><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Plk4 depletion leads to a failure of centriole duplication followed by a cell cycle arrest.</bold> (A) Graph showing the fold increase in cell number after IAA addition.

However, by the second day after IAA addition the duration of mitosis increased to a mean time of 84 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Nevertheless, all cells progressed to anaphase and successfully executed cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>).

We therefore investigated whether an increased mitotic duration could account for the cell cycle arrest observed after centriole duplication failure. We first set out to determine the window of tolerance for prometaphase duration in Plk4<sup>AID/AID</sup> cells. Plk4<sup>AID/AID</sup> cells were treated with 0.08 µM nocodazole for 6 h and the proliferative fate of daughter cells was monitored using time-lapse microscopy. Similar to the parental RPE1 cells, prolonging the duration of prometaphase in Plk4<sup>AID/AID</sup> cells to &gt;97 min caused a cell cycle arrest in all resulting daughters (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201502089/DC1" id="supp6">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>). Addition of IAA to parental RPE1 cells shortened the window of prometaphase tolerance to 60 min (Fig. S3 B). Consequently, we considered 60 min to be the prometaphase threshold for IAA-treated cells.</p><p>We next traced the lineage of individual Plk4<sup>AID/AID</sup> cells treated with IAA (Fig. S3 C). Only cells that entered the first division within 6 h of IAA addition were considered in our analysis. As a consequence, the first mitosis nearly always occurred with two centrioles at each spindle pole and all daughter cells continued to proliferate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>). In subsequent divisions, centriole number was successively reduced as expected from failed centriole duplication and continued cell growth. 48% of daughter cells arrested after the second mitosis, whereas 78% of daughters arrested after the third mitosis and all daughter cells arrested after the fourth mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). The delayed growth arrest after Plk4 destruction strongly suggests that a stress associated with a failure of centriole duplication not loss of Plk4, per se, is responsible for the proliferative arrest.</p><p>In the second division after Plk4 destruction, nearly all daughters of mothers that spent &gt;60 min in prometaphase arrested as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). However, 37% of the daughters of mothers that spent &lt;60 min in prometaphase also arrested and this fraction increased to 52% and 100% in the third and fourth divisions, respectively. It was previously shown that continuous inhibition of p38 MAPK activity with the small molecule SB203580 overcame the proliferative block caused by a prolonged prometaphase induced by transient nocodazole treatment. However, inhibition of p38 MAPK activity did not prevent or delay the cell cycle arrest caused by Plk4 loss (Fig. S3 D). We conclude that the cell cycle arrest caused by centriole duplication failure is not simply a result of a prolonged prometaphase duration (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Uetake and Sluder, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Previous work has shown that DNA damage, Hippo pathway activation, or excessive oxidative stress can cause cell cycle arrest (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ganem et al., 2014</xref>).

To confirm that chronically treated Plk4<sup>AID/AID</sup>;p53 shRNA cells lacked centrioles, we performed immunostaining for a variety of centriole components (CPAP, SAS6, STIL, CEP135, CEP152, and CEP192), but failed to observe centriole foci in the vast majority of cells (unpublished data). We therefore used thin-section EM to evaluate the presence of centrioles. Whereas centrioles were identified in 37/138 transverse sections of control cells, we never observed centrioles in 320 sections from chronically IAA-treated cells. Thus, the failure to detect Centrin foci almost certainly reflects an absence of centrioles in the vast majority of chronically treated Plk4<sup>AID/AID</sup>;p53 shRNA cells (hereafter referred to as acentriolar cells). Consistent with a lack of centrioles, the PCM component γ-tubulin was diffusely localized throughout the cytosol of interphase cells lacking centrioles and failed to concentrate at acentriolar spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). However, 55% of interphase acentriolar cells contained a single focus of the PCM component Pericentrin, suggesting that Pericentrin may have the capacity to self-organize in the absence of centrioles (Fig. S4 E).</p><p>To directly examine the divisions of cells lacking centrioles, acentriolar cells coexpressing TagRFP-tubulin, EGFP-Histone H2B, and EGFP-Cep63 were monitored by time-lapse microscopy.

Acentriolar divisions exhibited an increased mitotic duration (mean of 147 min, compared with 42 min for untreated cells) and were associated with a higher frequency of chromosome segregation errors (40% in acentriolar cells vs. 17% in control cells) and cytokinesis failure (22% in acentriolar cells vs. 1% in control cells) compared with untreated control Plk4<sup>AID/AID</sup>;p53 shRNA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Consistent with the increased incidence of cytokinesis failure, a subpopulation of acentriolar cells contained a tetraploid DNA content (Fig. S4 F).

Similarly, deletion of CPAP in the developing mouse brain also resulted in increased cell death, which was rescued by removal of p53 (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Insolera et al., 2014</xref>). The contrast between the apoptotic response in mouse embryos and the arrest we observed in human cells suggests that embryonic and adult cell types have different proclivities for initiating apoptosis or senescence after centriole loss. Interestingly, in contrast to the situation in mouse and human cells, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> cells lacking centrioles do not arrest or die (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Basto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Lecland et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that cell cycle checkpoints for eliminating acentriolar cells are more stringent in vertebrates.</p><p>Whereas mouse embryos proceed through many cell divisions without centrioles before initiating apoptosis, we found that many human somatic cells ceased dividing before the total loss of centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Importantly, we did not observe detectable increases in Hippo pathway activation, DNA damage, or cytokinesis failure in the two to three cell cycles that occur after Plk4 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3 E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4 E</xref>). We did, however, observe an increase in chromosome segregation errors in cells with a reduced centriole number (9% at day 1, 19% at day 2, and 14% at day 3 after IAA addition; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). Although chromosome segregation errors can lead to a p53-dependent arrest (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Thompson and Compton, 2010</xref>), the frequency of these errors was too low to account for the reduction in proliferation after Plk4 loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). In mouse embryos that lack centrioles, the stabilization of p53 was proposed to arise as a result of a modest (∼10 min) increase in mitotic duration (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bazzi and Anderson, 2014</xref>). However, using single-cell lineage tracing, we show that an extended mitosis cannot, by itself, explain the cell cycle arrest that occurs in human cells that fail centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Further investigation will therefore be required to establish the underlying cause of the proliferative arrest that occurs after Plk4 loss.</p><p>Removal of p53 allowed human cells to proliferate indefinitely despite the absence of centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). As centrosomes increase the speed of spindle assembly, these acentriolar cells formed bipolar spindles at a considerably slower rate than cells containing centrioles. In addition, acentriolar cells displayed chromosomal instability and frequent cytokinesis failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Similar mitotic errors have been reported in acentriolar <italic>D. melanogaser</italic> cells and transformed vertebrate cell lines, highlighting the important role of centrioles in ensuring the fidelity of cell division in adult cells (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Khodjakov and Rieder, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Basto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Debec et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Sir et al., 2013</xref>). Surprisingly, however, acentriolar mouse embryos showed no detectable increase in chromosome segregation errors (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bazzi and Anderson, 2014</xref>). The first five rounds of cell division in the mouse embryo are naturally acentriolar (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Szollosi et al., 1972</xref>) and it is therefore possible that mouse embryonic divisions are less dependent on centrioles for faithful chromosome segregation.</p><p>Overexpression of Plk4 did not promote de novo centriole formation in acentriolar mouse zygotes (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Coelho et al., 2013</xref>), but was capable of inducing de novo centriole formation in unfertilized fly eggs (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Peel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Rodrigues-Martins et al., 2007</xref>) and activated <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Eckerdt et al., 2011</xref>). Here we have shown that restoring endogenous levels of Plk4 induces de novo centriole formation in acentriolar human somatic cells. We speculate that de novo centrioles are created from Plk4 foci that form stochastically in the cytosol of acentriolar cells (Fig. S5 G). Once these foci surpass a threshold level of Plk4 activity, cartwheel assembly would be initiated, leading to centriole formation. Consistent with this idea, we were able to observe recruitment of the cartwheel components STIL and SAS6 to Plk4 foci as an early event occurring before incorporation of Centrin into de novo centrioles (Fig. S5 G).</p><p>De novo centrioles assembled very efficiently (within two to three cell cycles) after restoration of Plk4 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). This is in accordance with previous work examining the kinetics of de novo centriole formation in somatic human cells (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">La Terra et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Uetake et al., 2007</xref>) and green algae (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Marshall et al., 2001</xref>). Procentrioles formed in S phase are normally modified during mitosis to activate their ability to recruit PCM and function as MTOCs in the next cell cycle (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). In our experiments, cells that lack centrioles undergo a prolonged prometaphase, providing increased time for newly created de novo centrioles to be modified and converted into MTOCs. Consistently, we observed that in the first cell cycle the vast majority of de novo centrioles recruited small amounts of PCM in mitosis and were capable of segregating themselves on the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>). De novo centrioles duplicated in the second cell cycle after their creation, consistent with a previous study demonstrating that newly formed centrioles are modified in mitosis to license their duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, A and D</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A single centriole was shown to suppress de novo centriole assembly in the vast majority of cells, supporting the conclusion that existing centrioles inhibit the de novo assembly pathway (Fig. S5 E; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Marshall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">La Terra et al., 2005</xref>). Like canonical centriole assembly, de novo centriole formation requires Plk4 activity (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). An intriguing possibility, therefore, is that existing centrioles sequester an activator of Plk4 and thereby act to inhibit the cytosolic pool of Plk4 and suppress de novo centriole formation. The ability to induce timed de novo centriole biogenesis in populations of cycling acentriolar cells offers an excellent tool to dissect the molecular events involved in centriole formation and how existing centrioles antagonize the de novo pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s11"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s12"><title>Antibody production</title><p>A C-terminal Plk4 fragment (aa 510–970) was cloned into a pET-23b bacterial expression vector (EMD Millipore) containing a C-terminal 6xHis tag.

To generate the Plk4 targeting construct we cloned an AID degron followed by a 3xFLAG epitope tag, a translational stop codon, the Plk4 3′ UTR, and 150 bp of adjacent genomic sequence into the pBluescript derivative pNY to create the AID-3xFLAG-3′UTR;<italic>loxP</italic>-Neo<sup>R</sup>-<italic>loxP</italic> vector. 5′ and 3′ homology arms were PCR amplified from genomic RPE1 DNA and cloned on either side of the central AID-3xFLAG-3′UTR;<italic>loxP</italic>-Neo<sup>R</sup>-<italic>loxP</italic> cassette.

    <p>Cytotoxic T cells can dispatch tumor cells and cells infected by pathogens, killing their target within minutes by releasing the contents of specialized lysosomes known as cytotoxic granules. In general, exocytosis requires that R-SNARE proteins on vesicles interlock with Q-SNARE proteins on the plasma membrane, enabling the two membranes to fuse. One SNARE protein involved in granule release is the Q-SNARE syntaxin-11 (Stx11). Evidence from knockout mice also implicates VAMP8, which belongs to a family of R-SNARE proteins.</p>
    <p>Marshall et al. found that VAMP8 built up at the immunological synapse, the junction between a cytotoxic T cell and its victim. To their surprise, the researchers found that VAMP8 did not associate with cytotoxic granules. Instead, it rode on recycling endosomes, organelles that normally return proteins to the plasma membrane. These endosomes fused with the plasma membrane at the immunological synapse.</p>
    <p>Depleting VAMP8 not only prevented recycling endosomes from fusing with the plasma membrane, but it also abolished cytotoxic granule exocytosis. The team discovered that the VAMP8-carrying recycling endosomes arrived at the synapse before the cytotoxic granules and brought an important cargo—Stx11.</p>
    <p>The study indicates that recycling endosomes outfitted with VAMP8 deliver Stx11 to the immunological synapse. The researchers hypothesize that Stx11 then latches onto an unidentified SNARE on cytotoxic granules, connecting them to the plasma membrane and allowing them to jettison their contents.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Although Schwann cell myelin breakdown is the universal outcome of a remarkably wide range of conditions that cause disease or injury to peripheral nerves, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that make Schwann cell–mediated myelin digestion possible have not been established. We report that Schwann cells degrade myelin after injury by a novel form of selective autophagy, myelinophagy. Autophagy was up-regulated by myelinating Schwann cells after nerve injury, myelin debris was present in autophagosomes, and pharmacological and genetic inhibition of autophagy impaired myelin clearance. Myelinophagy was positively regulated by the Schwann cell JNK/c-Jun pathway, a central regulator of the Schwann cell reprogramming induced by nerve injury. We also present evidence that myelinophagy is defective in the injured central nervous system. These results reveal an important role for inductive autophagy during Wallerian degeneration, and point to potential mechanistic targets for accelerating myelin clearance and improving demyelinating disease.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s01"><title>Introduction</title><p>In peripheral nerves, myelin breakdown, or demyelination, is a universal outcome of a remarkably wide range of conditions that involve disturbance to Schwann cells or the nerve environment, whether due to genetic or acquired disease, toxicity, or nerve transection/crush. It has also become clear from studies on cut nerves that, perhaps surprisingly, Schwann cells themselves have the ability to turn against their own myelin and initiate myelin breakdown, in addition to being able to call on macrophages for myelin phagocytosis (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hirata and Kawabuchi, 2002</xref>). The maintenance of healthy myelin and normal nerve function depends on tight control of this intrinsic potential for myelin destruction. In contrast to Schwann cells, the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocytes, appear to be unable to digest myelin, a feature that has been linked to poor regenerative ability of CNS tissue (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Brosius Lutz and Barres, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In spite of the central position of myelin breakdown in Schwann cell biology and pathology, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that make Schwann cell–mediated myelin digestion possible have not been established. While earlier authors were often cautious about myelin breakdown mechanisms (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Holtzman and Novikoff, 1965</xref>), more recent literature frequently invokes phagocytosis as the mechanism by which Schwann cells digest their myelin after nerve transection/crush. But this notion is problematic. This is because phagocytosis is a process by which cells ingest cell-extrinsic material, but myelin is initially an intrinsic Schwann cell component, being an integral part of the Schwann cell membrane. Furthermore, there is no evidence that myelin separates from Schwann cells during the first, Schwann cell–dependent phase of myelin breakdown (see further below in the Introduction), although this would be required if myelin were to be phagocytosed by Schwann cells. Rather, in a process requiring actin polymerization, the myelin sheath breaks up into intracellular oval-shaped myelin segments that gradually fragment into smaller intracellular debris (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2011b</xref>). In the present work, we have examined the mechanism by which Schwann cells initiate digestion of intracellular myelin using nerve transection as a model for demyelination.</p><p>Schwann cells possess an unusual degree of phenotypic plasticity, and nerve transection triggers a large-scale transformation of the myelin and nonmyelin (Remak) cells of undisturbed nerves to form the repair (Bungner) Schwann cells of injured nerves (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Brosius Lutz and Barres, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Jessen et al., 2015</xref>). A major component of this cellular reprogramming is the removal of myelin. In the first phase of myelin clearance, the Schwann cells themselves break down 40–50% of the myelin during the first 5–7 d after injury (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Perry et al., 1995</xref>). Subsequently, macrophages that invade injured nerves play the major role in myelin breakdown by phagocytosis in conjunction with antibodies and complement. It is likely that Schwann cells take part in phagocytosis of myelin debris during this second phase of myelin clearance (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hirata and Kawabuchi, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Ramaglia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Vargas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Dubový et al., 2013</xref>). The importance of the initial Schwann cell–mediated phase of demyelination is underscored by the observation that 7 d after cutting, myelin is cleared normally from the nerves of CCR2<sup>−/−</sup> mice, although macrophages do not accumulate significantly in injured nerves in this mutant (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Niemi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Macroautophagy is an inducible degradation system by which cells break down their own organelles and large macromolecules. Autophagy involves the formation of an isolation membrane that extends around cytoplasmic cargo to form an autophagosome, which transfers cargo to the lysosome for degradation (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Rubinsztein et al., 2012</xref>). During starvation, autophagic degradation of cytoplasmic constituents provides a protective mechanism for energy release. In addition, specialized forms of autophagy mediate the delivery of specific cargo to the autophagosome, including intracellular pathogens (xenophagy; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Levine et al., 2011</xref>), cellular organelles (mitophagy, ribophagy; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kiel, 2010</xref>), and storage vesicles such as lipid droplets (lipophagy; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>While it has been understood for a long time that the first phase of myelin digestion in injured nerves is performed by Schwann cells, the cellular mechanism that enables Schwann cells to destroy their own myelin has not been established. Most nerve pathology involves breakdown of the myelin sheath, although demyelination occurs most acutely after injury, as part of the cellular reprogramming from myelin cells to repair cells. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of Schwann cell–mediated demyelination in injured nerves potentially has broader implications. Here, we present evidence that autophagy, a mechanism by which many cells digest their intrinsic cellular components, plays a central role in Schwann cell myelin breakdown. We show that nerve injury triggers strong activation of Schwann cell autophagy, find myelin debris in autophagosomes, and demonstrate a strong requirement for autophagy in myelin digestion, revealing a novel form of selective autophagy of the myelin sheath, myelinophagy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s02"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>Autophagy is induced in Schwann cells in response to nerve injury</title><p>Transcriptional regulation of autophagy-related genes coincides with autophagy induction in several systems (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Klionsky et al., 2012</xref>).

We analyzed levels of LC3 II in response to injury in vivo and observed a clear increase in its levels, peaking at 5 d and decreasing thereafter. Conversely, levels of the autophagy substrate NBR1 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Klionsky et al., 2012</xref>) showed a clear decrease in injured nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). p62, another autophagy substrate, could not be used since we found its levels to be transcriptionally regulated by nerve injury, unlike NBR1 (unpublished data). To confirm that this increase reflected an induction of autophagy, we examined autophagic flux in nerve segments maintained in vitro. In this established model of Schwann cell demyelination, short nerve segments are cultured in vitro, leading to progressive myelin breakdown, similar to the changes seen in vivo. Myelin breakdown is mainly performed by Schwann cells because invading macrophages are absent (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez-Valle et al., 1995</xref>). We found that treatment with the lysosome inhibitor NH<sub>4</sub>Cl led to a strong accumulation of LC3 II and NBR1 in demyelinating nerve segments cultured in vitro for 5 d (5D Cut), but not in freshly isolated nerve segments (Uncut). Net LC3 II flux calculations confirmed the significantly higher autophagic flux in the demyelinating segments, compared with uncut segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). To confirm these findings, we examined autophagy flux in dissociated Schwann cell cultures. In this model, highly pure myelinating Schwann cells, obtained from sciatic nerves of 8–10 d old rats, are plated and cultured over a period of time, leading to progressive myelin degradation in the cells. We found an accumulation of LC3 II and NBR1 in demyelinating cultures but not in freshly plated cells. These findings were confirmed by net LC3 II calculations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Collectively, this indicates that up-regulation of LC3 II and breakdown of the autophagy substrate NBR1 after injury is a result of a strong and rapid autophagy induction, concurrent with the onset of myelin degradation.</p><p>To show that autophagy was induced specifically in demyelinating Schwann cells, we used mice expressing a GFP-tagged LC3 transgene, a model widely used to monitor autophagy in vivo (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mizushima et al., 2004</xref>). In cultured nerves from these mice, we observed the appearance of cleaved GFP bands, indicative of autophagic breakdown of cargo (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Klionsky et al., 2012</xref>), during active demyelination (2, 5, and 7 d) but not when demyelination is essentially complete (10 d; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). This confirmed our findings that autophagy is induced during active demyelination at 2–7 d after injury and down-regulated thereafter.</p><p>Uninjured myelinated fibers from these mice contained few or no GFP-LC3 punctate structures. In contrast, numerous GFP-LC3 puncta, representing autophagosomes (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Klionsky et al., 2012</xref>), were associated with degenerating myelin in nerve segments maintained in vitro for 3–7 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, G and H</xref>). The lysosomal marker LAMP1 has been shown to be associated with degenerating myelin fragments 3 and 7 d after nerve injury (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2011a</xref>). Similar results were obtained with dissociated Schwann cell cultures, where numerous GFP-LC3 puncta were observed in actively demyelinating Schwann cells (MPZ<sup>+</sup>), whereas myelin-negative cells were largely negative for GFP-LC3 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>). Together this indicates that in individual cells, autophagosome formation correlates with active myelin digestion.</p><p>To confirm that the Schwann cell autophagy machinery is selectively targeted to myelin during active digestion, electron microscopy of cultured nerve segments and Schwann cell cultures were performed. We found myelin debris clearly enclosed in double membrane vesicles typical of autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>).

To test whether the JNK/c-Jun pathway regulated myelinophagy, we examined autophagic flux in nerves from WT mice treated with SP600125 and nerves from WT and c-Jun cKO mice. Autophagic flux was significantly reduced in SP600125-treated and c-Jun cKO nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>).

Phagocytosis has often been suggested to be the mechanism by which Schwann cells digest their myelin, in spite of the fact that myelin is initially an intrinsic Schwann cell component (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Holtzman and Novikoff, 1965</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2011b</xref>). While Schwann cells may well assist macrophages in phagocytosing myelin debris at later times after injury, we show here that autophagy, a mechanism by which a wide variety of cells break down their own intrinsic cellular components, is an important mechanism by which Schwann cells initiate the degradation of myelin proteins and lipids after nerve injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Med?><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Outline of myelinophagy.</bold> (left) A transverse section through a myelin Schwann cell in an uninjured nerve.

The proposed role of autophagy in digesting these fragments is illustrated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_201503019_Fig8"/></fig><p>Autophagy-associated genes and autophagic flux were strikingly induced in transected nerves, and myelin-containing double-membrane autophagosomes were found in demyelinating Schwann cells. Genetic inhibition of autophagy inhibited myelin protein and lipid breakdown in injured nerves, and similar results were obtained with pharmacological autophagy inhibitors. When the bulk of myelin breakdown was accomplished, Schwann cells down-regulated autophagy, and myelin-negative cells were largely negative for GFP-LC3 autophagosomes, indicating a cell-autonomous mechanism for reduction of autophagy once myelin is digested. Collectively, these observations indicate that after injury of peripheral nerves, myelin proteins and lipids are selectively targeted for degradation by activation of myelin autophagy in Schwann cells.</p><p>This injury-induced Schwann cell myelinophagy is mTOR-independent. Namely, it is not activated by suppression of mTOR, the classical mechanism for autophagy activation, as we found that mTOR was activated, rather than suppressed, in transected nerves (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kroemer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Ravikumar et al., 2010</xref>). mTOR-independent autophagy has been described in other systems, and can be stimulated by lithium and ceramide (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Ravikumar et al., 2010</xref>), both of which also promoted myelin autophagy in Schwann cells. The mechanism for activation of autophagy by mTOR suppression also exists in Schwann cells, however, because mTOR inhibition by starvation or rapamycin activates autophagy in Trembler J mice, where it functions to clear PMP22 myelin protein aggregates and improve myelination (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Rangaraju et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our data show that activation of autophagy is an important component of the reprogramming of Schwann cells that is triggered by nerve cut (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Jessen et al., 2015</xref>). In injured nerves, we see activation of mTOR, a pathway that drives major biosynthetic processes and accelerates catabolism and growth. These functions are likely to be required during the dynamic Schwann cell response to injury, which, in addition to myelin breakdown, involves major reorganization of the molecular and morphological profile of myelin and nonmyelin (Remak) cells to generate repair (Bungner) Schwann cells (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012</xref>). The coexistence of autophagy to promote removal of redundant myelin and mTOR activation therefore makes biological sense.</p><p>The JNK1/c-Jun pathway stimulates autophagy in several cell types, and ceramide stimulates autophagy in part by activating this pathway (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Pattingre et al., 2009</xref>). In line with this, we find that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of JNK1/c-Jun reduces Schwann cell autophagic flux. Because nerve injury rapidly activates JNK1/c-Jun in Schwann cells (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Parkinson et al., 2008</xref>), it is likely that the delay in myelin clearance seen when the JNK1/c-Jun pathway is inhibited pharmacologically or genetically is in part mediated by defective autophagy (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mirsky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012</xref>). Another potential link between JNK1/c-Jun and autophagy is seen in uninjured nerves of C3 mice that model CMT1A demyelinating neuropathy. We found that in these nerves, high Schwann cell c-Jun expression (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hantke et al., 2014</xref>) is accompanied by elevated LC3 II, which is consistent with autophagy activation.</p><p>Myelin breakdown in the CNS is ineffective. In line with this, we found a marked difference between the injured optic and sciatic nerves, as LC3 II levels, a key indicator of autophagy, were not significantly elevated in the injured optic nerve in contrast to the sciatic. It is intriguing that elevation of c-Jun in cut optic nerves is also minimal relative to that seen in Schwann cells (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Vaudano et al., 1996</xref>), although the relevance of this to myelin breakdown and regeneration remains to be established.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified myelinophagy as a major mechanism for Schwann cell–mediated myelin breakdown in injured nerves. We also provide evidence that myelin autophagy is aberrantly regulated in demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, and defective in CNS glia after injury. Identifying an endogenous Schwann cell mechanism for the myelin breakdown that takes place when nerves are cut has broader implications, since activation of autophagy can now be considered to be a plausible candidate mechanism for myelin breakdown in other situations. This includes acquired and inherited demyelinating disease and the age-related degeneration of myelin. Therefore, the recognition of this mechanism in Schwann cells potentially provides novel targets for manipulating demyelination in injury and disease. It also throws new light on the remarkable absence of myelin breakdown by oligodendrocytes. It would be important in future studies to test whether modulation of myelinophagy improves repair in both the injured peripheral nervous system and CNS, and prevents myelin breakdown in demyelinating neuropathies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s08"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s09"><title>Animals</title><p>Animal experiments conformed to UK Home Office guidelines under the supervision of UCL Biological Services, and to the Spanish/European regulations on animal use under the supervision of the institutional committee at CIC bioGUNE (AAALAC-accredited facility) and the Instituto de Neurociencias de Alicante.</p><p><italic>Atg7<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were made by insertion of <italic>loxP</italic> sequences and a stop codon within introns 13 and 14 of the a<italic>tg7</italic> gene (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Komatsu et al., 2005</xref>).

A peak list containing the differential peptides was generated for each comparison, and searched against a database using the Mascot Search engine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.matrixscience.com">www.matrixscience.com</ext-link>). Only proteins with at least two peptides passing the FDR &lt;1% filter were considered for further analysis. Finally, only proteins with ANOVA P &lt; 0.05 and a ratio &gt;1.5 in either direction were considered as significantly deregulated. To calculate total protein volumes, searches with unfiltered data were also performed following the same approach. The fold change between cut nerves and their respective control uncut nerves were then calculated for each replicate.</p></sec><sec id="s21"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Nerves from surgical transection or cultured nerve segments were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and transferred to tubes containing 10–12 10B lysing matrix beads and 100 µl of lysis buffer (5 M urea, 2.5% SDS, 50 mM Tris, and 30 mM NaCl). Samples were placed in a Fastprep homogenizer for 45 s at level 6, chilled on ice, and then subjected to a repeat homogenization at the same setting. Lysates were then centrifuged at 4°C at 10,000 rpm for 2 min. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes and centrifuged again at the same settings. New supernatants were collected and stored at −80°C.</p><p>Cultured Schwann cells were extracted by cell scraping. Cells on 35-mm tissue culture dishes were washed twice with PBS before addition of 100 µl of lysis buffer (T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were scraped with a plastic cell lifter and the lysate was collected. Lysates were then centrifuged at 4°C at 10,000 rpm for 2 min. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes and centrifuged again at the same settings. New supernatants were collected and stored at −80°C.</p><p>Between 5 µg and 40 µg of protein samples were loaded onto acrylamide gels and run alongside prestained standard molecular weight markers (PageRuler prestained protein ladder; Thermo Fisher Scientific) to enable identification of band sizes. Gels were run using the mini Protean II gel electrophoresis apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond ECL; Amersham Biosciences) or PVDF (Immobilon-P; EMD Millipore) membranes using the Bio-Rad Laboratories semi-dry system.</p><p>Membranes were blocked in 5% fat-free milk powder (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 1 h (at room temperature) and subsequently incubated overnight at 4°C in primary antibodies diluted in 5% milk/PBS on a slow rotator (Gallenkamp). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2,000) were used (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and membranes were developed with ECL reagent (GE Healthcare). Experiments were repeated at least three times with fresh samples and representative pictures are shown. Densitometric quantification of Western blots was performed using ImageJ analysis software or Image Lab 4.1 (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The measurements were normalized to loading controls (GAPDH or β-Actin), and for each experiment, at least three different biological replicates were used.</p></sec><sec id="s22"><title>Behavioral tests</title><p>All experiments were performed according to UK Home Office guidelines. Four mice from each genotype were tested and at least three measurements from each mouse were taken to obtain mean values.</p><sec id="s23"><title>Walking beam</title><p>Mice walked along a wooden beam 1 m long, 20 cm high, and 0.5 cm wide to assess sensorimotor function. Foot slips and beam falls were counted over the middle distance of 70 cm. A performance score was given as follows: 0 and 1 foot slips = a score of 1; 2–5 foot slips = a score of 2; &gt;5 foot slips or at least 1 beam fall = a score of 3. Mice were first accustomed to the beam in training sessions on two days that included walking on wider beams of 2 cm and 1.2 cm. At the end of the second day, mice were scored on the 0.5 cm beam.</p></sec><sec id="s24"><title>Sciatic function index (SFI)</title><p>Paw prints were taken from 6-wk-old mice to calculate the SFI. The SFI formula correlates mouse paw prints with nerve function, as described previously (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Inserra et al., 1998</xref>). The hind limb paws of the mice were painted on the plantar surface with black paint. Mice then walked down a 54 × 5-cm wooden corridor lined with 200 gsm highly absorbent paper (Goldline). Prints were subsequently scanned (Perfection 3100; Epson) to generate digital paw prints. Toe spread (the distance between the first and fifth toes) and print length (the distance between the third toe and the heel) were measured using ImageJ, and Excel (Microsoft) was used to convert the measurements into SFI values using an established formula (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Inserra et al., 1998</xref>). The SFI formula is: SFI = 118.9 (ETS − NTS/NTS) − 51.2 (EPL − NPL/NPL) − 7.5, where ETS is experimental toe spread, NTS is normal toe spread, EPL is experimental paw length, and NPL is normal paw length. An SFI value of −100 represents complete loss of function.</p></sec><sec id="s25"><title>Hanging wire test</title><p>Masking tape was placed around the perimeter of a cage lid. Mice were placed individually on top of the lid, which was then slowly turned around with the mouse hanging on upside down by all four legs. Mice were allowed to hang for 2 min. Latency until fall was noted, unless mice remained on the lid for the full 2 min.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s26"><title>Net LC3 II flux</title><p>Net LC3 II flux was calculated by analyzing LC3 II turnover by Western blotting in the presence or absence of lysosomal inhibitors. In brief, net LC3 II flux was calculated by subtracting the densitometry value of normalized (relative to GAPDH) LC3 II in the sample treated with lysosomal inhibitor by the value in the control sample (untreated). A minimum of three biological replicate experiments were performed for net LC3 II flux calculations.</p></sec><sec id="s27"><title>Statistics</title><p>Values are given as means ± SEM (<italic>n</italic> = 3 unless otherwise stated). Statistical significance was analyzed with the Student’s <italic>t</italic> test and p-values &lt;0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec id="s28"><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows qPCR analysis of autophagy-related genes from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>. Fig. S2 shows densitometric quantification of Western blots from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>. Fig. S3 shows that uninjured Atg7 cKO nerves are normal using behavioral and biochemical analyses. Fig. S4 shows that Atg7 cKO nerves have reduced autophagy activation after nerve injury, and that this retards myelin degradation. Fig. S5 shows that myelinophagy is mTOR-independent, and is regulated by ceramide and lithium. Table S1 shows the list of primers used for qPCR analysis. Table S2 shows changes in levels of individual lipid species after nerve injury in ATG7 WT and cKO mice as determined by UPLC analysis of purified myelin.

        <p>Cnn and PLP directly interact at two defined sites to coordinate the cell cycle–dependent rearrangement and scaffolding activity of the centrosome to permit normal centrosome organization, cell division, and embryonic viability.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Pericentriolar material (PCM) mediates the microtubule (MT) nucleation and anchoring activity of centrosomes. A scaffold organized by Centrosomin (Cnn) serves to ensure proper PCM architecture and functional changes in centrosome activity with each cell cycle. Here, we investigate the mechanisms that spatially restrict and temporally coordinate centrosome scaffold formation. Focusing on the mitotic-to-interphase transition in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryos, we show that the elaboration of the interphase Cnn scaffold defines a major structural rearrangement of the centrosome. We identify an unprecedented role for Pericentrin-like protein (PLP), which localizes to the tips of extended Cnn flares, to maintain robust interphase centrosome activity and promote the formation of interphase MT asters required for normal nuclear spacing, centrosome segregation, and compartmentalization of the syncytial embryo. Our data reveal that Cnn and PLP directly interact at two defined sites to coordinate the cell cycle–dependent rearrangement and scaffolding activity of the centrosome to permit normal centrosome organization, cell division, and embryonic viability.</p>

  <body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s01"><title>Introduction</title><p>Centrosomes are composed of a pair of centrioles embedded in pericentriolar material (PCM) and function as microtubule (MT) organizing centers (MTOCs; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Gould and Borisy, 1977</xref>). In mitosis, centrosomes organize the bipolar spindle, while in interphase they direct cell migration, traffic cargoes, and build cilia (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Doxsey et al., 2005</xref>). These functional changes are linked to oscillations in PCM levels. Centrosomes gain MTOC activity by increasing PCM levels, or maturing, before mitosis. The process is then reversed during mitotic exit (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Khodjakov and Rieder, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Palazzo et al., 2000</xref>). Elucidating the regulation of PCM dynamics is critical to understanding how centrosome function is normally modulated and deregulated in disease (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Super-resolution microscopy has revised our view of PCM from an amorphous cloud to a structured architecture (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Fu and Glover, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Lawo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Mennella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Sonnen et al., 2012</xref>). PCM organization into distinct zones appears conserved across taxa (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Lüders, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Mennella et al., 2014</xref>), and some proteins, such as Pericentrin (Pcnt)-like protein (PLP; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Kawaguchi and Zheng, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Campos et al., 2004</xref>), and its mammalian orthologue, Pcnt, radially extend across zones (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Lawo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Mennella et al., 2012</xref>). Understanding how proteins function within these subdomains is key to understanding the cell cycle dynamics, regulation, and function of PCM.</p><p>One question that emerges from the discovery of the PCM organization is the identification of the molecular glue, or scaffold, that holds the structure together. A centrosome scaffold was first proposed upon resolving Pcnt and γ-Tubulin (γTub) to a reticular, tubelike lattice (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Dictenberg et al., 1998</xref>). Much of our understanding of the scaffold comes from studies of the syncytial <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryo, where a constitutively active MTOC serves several essential functions: proper nuclear migration/spacing, actin organization, rapid progression through abridged nuclear cycles (NCs) that lack gap phases, and cellularization (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Callaini and Riparbelli, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Rothwell and Sullivan, 2000</xref>). Increasing evidence suggests that Centrosomin (Cnn) forms an oligomerized scaffold required to recruit other PCM proteins (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Megraw et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Vaizel-Ohayon and Schejter, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Megraw, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kao and Megraw, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Conduit et al., 2010</xref><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">, 2014a</xref><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">,b</xref>). Thus far, a conserved motif at the N terminus of Cnn (CM1; <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Megraw, 2007</xref>), a direct interaction between Cnn and Spd2 (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Conduit et al., 2014b</xref>), and phosphorylation of Cnn by Polo kinase (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Conduit et al., 2014a</xref>) have all been implicated in Cnn scaffold assembly. However, how the Cnn scaffold efficiently assembles with each rapid NC remains poorly understood.</p><p>In humans, mutations in Pcnt and the Cnn orthologue, Cdk5rap2/Cep215, are associated with microcephaly (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bond et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Rauch et al., 2008</xref>). Because a functional interaction between Pcnt and Cep215 may provide a mechanistic link between these disorders (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Buchman et al., 2010</xref>), further understanding the interplay between these molecules may contribute to our understanding of disease etiology.

Mutant analysis supports a role for PLP in coordinating the cell cycle–dependent rearrangement of the Cnn scaffold that is essential for normal centrosome function.

At embryonic centrosomes, Cnn dramatically rearranges from a compact sphere in mitosis to an expanded interphase structure that is defined by a central bolus of PCM and extended radial fibers (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Li and Kaufman, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Megraw et al., 2002</xref>); for clarity, we refer to these fibers as Cnn flares. In addition, Cnn particles are released into the cytoplasm primarily during interphase (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Megraw et al., 2002</xref>). This leads to an attractive model whereby the cell cycle–dependent modulation of Cnn organization directly regulates centrosome activity. However, mechanisms regulating this reorganization remain poorly understood, and the physiological significance of centrosome shape changes is currently unknown.</p><p>To study Cnn during the rapid early divisions, it is critical to precisely track the timing of its reorganization. By imaging recombineered Cnn in embryos coexpressing the nuclear marker H2A-RFP, we find that Cnn is a compact structure during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201503117/DC1" id="supp1">Video 1</ext-link>). Upon mitotic exit and throughout interphase, Cnn becomes expansive and particulate, ultimately extending reticulated flares that greatly increase centrosome volume and eject particles into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, 4:06). These findings are in agreement with a seminal study of Cnn dynamics (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Megraw et al., 2002</xref>). To monitor the conspicuous changes to centrosome size and shape, we visualized Cnn distribution by SIM. SIM resolves mitotic Cnn as a hollow sphere with a discernable strand-like substructure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B–B</xref>″) with few cytoplasmic particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>‴). In contrast, interphase centrosomes form a more elaborate shape with extended flares of uneven thickness and length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C–C</xref>″). These flares are sites of Cnn particle release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>‴), which appear analogous to mammalian centriole satellites (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Rattner, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Balczon et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Megraw, 2007</xref>), as both are ejected from the centrosome and bidirectionally move during interphase (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Kubo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Megraw et al., 2002</xref>).

Retention of Cnn at the interphase centrosome is consistent with the constitutive activity of embryonic centrosomes throughout the cell cycle, which is thought to permit efficient NC progression (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Callaini and Riparbelli, 1990</xref>). These findings suggest that embryonic Cnn does not follow the paradigm of PCM shedding and total centrosome dematuration during mitotic exit, and only a small amount of Cnn is released into the cytoplasm as particles.

Thus, the outer edge of the PCM zone expands as embryos enter interphase. The major structural change to the interphase centrosome is the addition of extensive Cnn flares, which protrude well beyond the PCM zone. We term this zone the interphase flare zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, brown shading; and Fig. S1, A and B).

Sas4 and Bld10/Cep135 are also enriched in the centriole zone, but show low levels at discrete foci within the flare zone (Fig. S1 C, enhanced image). Polo, a key regulator of maturation, radially extends into the PCM zone, while low levels of PLK4/SAK, a key regulator of centriole duplication, localize to small foci within the flare zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2 C</xref> and S1 C).

SIM resolves PLP satellites as rings with a diameter of 187 ± 22.9 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 40). Based on the unique localization of PLP satellites to the tips of the extended interphase centrosome, we hypothesized that PLP functions as a molecular scaffold that stabilizes Cnn flares and contributes to centrosome shape and, in turn, centrosome function.</p></sec><sec id="s06"><title>PLP satellites and Cnn flares share similar dynamics and coassemble</title><p>To investigate the function of PLP satellites in detail, we examined live embryos expressing full-length PLP-GFP (PLP<sup>FL</sup>), which mirrors endogenous PLP distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>) and fully rescues <italic>plp<sup>−</sup></italic> viability (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Galletta et al., 2014</xref>).

Injecting embryos expressing PLP-GFP and Cnn-mCherry with colchicine results in the concomitant compaction of Cnn and PLP (Fig. S2 C).

Another correlation is observed upon examination of mother and daughter centrosomes. It was previously noted that higher levels of Cnn accumulate on the mother as compared with the daughter (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Conduit et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, we note that greater amounts of PLP associate with the larger, Cnn-rich mother centrosome than the smaller daughter centrosome (Fig. S2 D).

Our data show that motifs outside of PLP-F5 are sufficient to generate PLP satellites and maintain colocalization with Cnn within flares and cytoplasmic particles.</p><p>Notably, PLP<sup>Δ5</sup> satellites are less structured and extend farther from the centriole (1.5 ± 0.5 µm vs. 1.2 ± 0.3 µm for PLP<sup>FL</sup> and 1.2 ± 0.3 µm for endogenous PLP; <italic>n</italic> = 20 centrosomes).

Surprisingly, live imaging reveals that PLP<sup>Δ5</sup> satellites persist throughout the cell cycle (<italic>n</italic> = 6/6 embryos; Fig. S4 C and Video 10), which is unlikely due to overexpression of PLP, as PLP<sup>FL</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3 A</xref>) or PLP<sup>Δ5</sup> in the WT background do not perturb the normal centrosome structures (Fig. S4 A). Importantly, the PLP<sup>Δ5</sup> gain-of-function phenotype in mitosis lends support to the hypothesis that PLP satellites act to organize Cnn, because the abnormal mitotic PLP<sup>Δ5</sup> satellites also organize abnormal interphase-like Cnn flares (Fig. S4, B and E). Even when only one mitotic centrosome at a nucleus displays PLP<sup>Δ5</sup> satellites, it also extends Cnn flares (Fig. S4 D, solid box), whereas the PLP satellite-free centrosome shows compact Cnn that is characteristic of normal mitotic centrosomes (Fig. S4 D, broken box), implicating local regulation of centrosome organization by the PLP–Cnn complex. Overall, these data suggest that PLP-F5 is dispensable for PLP satellite and Cnn flare formation, but is required for their proper organization and mitotic compaction.

Our data show that PLP undergoes a major rearrangement that is entrained to the cell cycle and is critical for proper Cnn dynamics, distribution, and functions upstream of γTub.</p><p>Interestingly, our imaging of Cnn during mitotic exit is highly suggestive of Cnn forming a reticular, strand-like structure that is compact in mitosis, but unravels as the cell enters interphase to form a giant centrosome with constitutive MTOC activity. The mechanisms that control these Cnn dynamic movements will require further studies, including the use of fluorescence photoconversion methods. What mediates this cell cycle–dependent transition in centrosome architecture? One compelling candidate is Polo, which is known to phosphorylate Cnn and promote its lattice formation (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Conduit et al., 2014a</xref>). What is the role and significance of this cell cycle–dependent transition in centrosome architecture? Our collective data support a model where this temporal regulation of PCM expansion and compaction likely ensures normal MT organization to avoid erroneous MT attachments, collisions with neighboring nuclei, and the ensuing DNA damage and embryonic lethality.</p><p>Moreover, we uncovered PLP localized to the tip of each Cnn flare. These PLP satellites are distinct from a PCM pool of PLP predicted by FRAP analysis of PACT-GFP (a GFP fusion with a motif from the C terminus of PLP; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Campos et al., 2004</xref>), as we find that PACT-GFP is absent from PLP satellites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Thus, PACT is not an accurate predictor of PLP localization, at least not beyond the centriole pool (see also <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Fu and Glover, 2012</xref>). More recently, FRAP of PLP-GFP also showed nonuniform recovery within the centrosome, but a second major peak corresponding to PLP satellites at distances beyond the PCM zone at 650 nm was not reported (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Conduit et al., 2014b</xref>). Thus, our work is the first to describe the dynamic behavior of PLP satellites, which define the end of Cnn flares and the outer margin of the interphase centrosome.</p><p>Several recent studies support a model of Cnn scaffold formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Polo phosphorylates Cnn at sites within Cnn-F2 near the centriole wall, which is required for the formation of higher-order Cnn structures (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Conduit et al., 2014a</xref>). The Cnn scaffold then migrates into the PCM zone (between 200 and 600 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>). Spd2 is critical for this process (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Fu and Glover, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Conduit et al., 2014b</xref>), where it functions in a positive feedback loop with Cnn to form a Spd2–Cnn PCM scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>, gray box, 1), which is consistent with earlier studies showing that Cep192/Spd2 recruits PCM (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dix and Raff, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Gomez-Ferreria et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Giansanti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Haren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Fu and Glover, 2012</xref>). Our work suggests that PLP satellites and Cnn form a second, spatially distinct scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>, outside of gray box) located in the interphase centrosome flare zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>, 600–1,400 nm). These two scaffolds are likely interactive, as our live imaging suggests that Cnn emerges from the PCM zone and extends into the flare zone in an MT-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>, 2). Additionally, a conserved motif at the N terminus of Cnn, CM1, is required for the extension of Cnn flares (<xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Megraw, 2007</xref>). We speculate that CM1 may link Cnn to MTs and drive scaffold expansion in embryos and/or centrosome dematuration in other cell types.</p><p>Although related, the two scaffolds are likely functionally unique. The Spd2–Cnn scaffold is the main anchor of γTub within the PCM zone, whereas the PLP–Cnn scaffold functions to anchor Cnn within the flare zone, effectively preventing interphase centrosome dematuration by resisting MT-dependent particle release forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>, 4 and 5). Critically, unlike the Spd2–Cnn scaffold, the PLP–Cnn scaffold is exclusive to interphase centrosomes. We conclude that each architectural subdomain that comprises the centrosome structure is subject to multiple layers of regulation, some being zone specific. This stratification of regulatory organization defines the function of each zone.</p><p>Our Y2H studies show that PLP and Cnn likely interact at two defined domains. Analysis of PLP<sup>Δ5</sup> suggests that the Cnn(F1)–PLP(F5) interaction is required to properly organize Cnn flares and PLP satellites, and is required to dampen Cnn particle release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>, 5). However, this large truncation includes the PACT domain and may disrupt other PLP interactions. Nevertheless, we can conclude that the Cnn(F1)–PLP(F5) interaction is not essential for PLP–Cnn scaffold formation, because Cnn and PLP still colocalize at flares and cytoplasmic particles. The second interaction between Cnn-F3 and PLP-F2 requires the Cnn CM2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>, 6) and is disrupted by the <italic>cnn</italic><sup>B4</sup> mutation. However, this mutation also disrupts an interaction with Cen required for actin furrow assembly (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kao and Megraw, 2009</xref>). Formally, we cannot rule out the possibility that the <italic>cnn</italic><sup>B4</sup> mutation may disrupt Cnn function due to protein destabilization. In addition, because gross actin aberrations were not observed in <italic>plp</italic><sup>−</sup> mutants (unpublished data), it is likely that Cnn CM2 mediates several interactions involved in distinct pathways that are disrupted in the <italic>cnn</italic><sup>B4</sup> mutant background. Nevertheless, the <italic>cnn</italic><sup>B4</sup> mutation does lead to a loss of PLP satellites, with no effect on the PLP centriole pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>, 3). This intriguing result supports a model where PLP satellites and Cnn flares are functionally interdependent within the interphase flare zone, analogous to the interdependence of Spd2 and Cnn within the PCM zone. Moreover, the <italic>cnn</italic><sup>B4</sup> mutation demonstrates a specific separation of PLP function at satellites versus centrioles. Our data show the disordered localization of Cnn and γTub, as well as NUF and embryonic lethality, is more severe in <italic>cnn</italic><sup>B4</sup> than in <italic>plp</italic><sup>−</sup> mutants. These data suggest that Cnn functions to organize interphase centrosome structure through multiple pathways, with only one requiring PLP activity.</p><p>Previous work on the regulation of Cnn by Polo and Spd2, combined with our functional analysis of direct interactions with PLP, paints a complex portrait of the Cnn molecule. We propose that the coregulation of PLP satellites and Cnn flares is required for their anchorage to the centrosome, preventing interphase centrosome inactivation, and maintaining robust MT asters throughout the cell cycle. Disruption of this interphase PLP–Cnn scaffold leads to increased cytoplasmic PCM particles that act as platforms for MTs, leading to the formation of an aberrant interphase MT array in the embryo. These effects on MTs then cause defects in centrosome separation, nuclear spacing, and spindle assembly, culminating in chromosome missegregation, DNA damage, and embryonic lethality. Together, our data emphasize the fundamental importance of regulating interphase centrosome form and function for viability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s13"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s14"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>The following mutant strains and transgenic lines were used: the <italic>plp</italic><sup>2172</sup> allele is a P-element insertion that interrupts the PLP sequence (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Spradling et al., 1999</xref>) and was recombined onto the FRT<sup>2A</sup> chromosome to generate <italic>plp</italic><sup>2172</sup>; FRT<sup>2A</sup> chromosomes were used for the generation of germline clones (<italic>plp</italic><sup>−</sup> embryos) by the FLP/<italic>ovoD</italic> method (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chou and Perrimon, 1996</xref>); the <italic>tacc</italic><sup>1</sup> allele is a strong hypomorph (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gergely et al., 2000</xref>); and Df(3R)Excel<sup>6142</sup> (Bloomington Stock Center), <italic>msps</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> (Vienna Drosophila Resource Center transformant 21982), and maternal-Tubulin GAL4 expressed GAL4 under the control of the maternal Tubulin promoter (Bloomington Stock Center); <italic>cnn</italic><sup>B4</sup> is a hypomorphic allele caused by an R1141H single amino acid mutation (<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Vaizel-Ohayon and Schejter, 1999</xref>), Ubi-GFP-γ-Tub23C expresses GFP-γ-Tub23C under the Ubiquitin promoter, and P<sub>Bac</sub>-GFP-SAS6 is a recombineered GFP-SAS6 construct (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Lerit and Rusan, 2013</xref>); UASp-Bld10-GFP expresses Cep135/Bld10-GFP under UAS (upstream activating sequence) regulator elements (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Mottier-Pavie and Megraw, 2009</xref>); Ubi-GFP-PACT is a fusion of GFP with the PACT domain of PLP expressed under the Ubiquitin promoter (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Campos et al., 2004</xref>); Ubi-GFP-SAK expresses GFP-SAK/Plk4 under the Ubiquitin promoter (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Basto et al., 2008</xref>); GFP-Polo expresses GFP-Polo with a Polo promoter (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Moutinho-Santos et al., 1999</xref>); Ubi-D-TACC-RFP expresses TACC-RFP under the Ubiquitin promoter (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Conduit et al., 2010</xref>); Ubi-GFP-SAS4 expresses GFP-SAS4 under the Ubiquitin promoter (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dix and Raff, 2007</xref>); H2AvD-mRFP expresses H2A-RFP under endogenous regulatory elements (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Pandey et al., 2005</xref>); Ubi-GFP-α-Tubulin expresses GFP-α-Tubulin under the Ubiquitin promoter (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Rebollo et al., 2004</xref>); and mCherry-Cnn (a gift from P.

The embryos and coverslip were inverted onto a 50-mm gas-permeable lumox dish (Sarstedt) fitted with two halves of a broken #1 coverslip used as spacers. Images were collected at 0.25-µm intervals over a 5–10 µm volume at 30-s time intervals or imaged at 500-ms intervals in a single optical plane as noted. Images were assembled using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health), Photoshop (Adobe), and QuickTime Player Pro 7 (Apple) software to crop regions of interest, adjust brightness and contrast, separate or merge channels, and generate maximum-intensity projections.</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Total fluorescence intensity projections of the entire centrosome/centriole volume were used to measure the peak (P) and outer edge (OE) position of Sas6, Asl, and PLP, and the OE position of γTub and Cnn. Single optical sections through the middle of the centrosome were used for P measurements of γTub and Cnn. All line scans were single-pixel-wide line scans of 5 µm generated by the Plot Profile tool in ImageJ. Line scans were converted to a −2.50 to 2.50 scale such that the 0.0 µm position marked the center of the centriole. Average background fluorescence was subtracted from each pixel along the line scan. GraphPad Software was then used to fit each line scan to a Gaussian curve from which the mean (μ) and SD (Gaussian RMS) was calculated. μ represents the position of the Gaussian peak (P), which is the peak fluorescence intensity. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) was calculated for each curve using 2.35482×SD. The protein’s OE was calculated as μ + (0.5×FWHM). The mean P and OE for each measured centrosome protein is reported in Fig. S1 A. For Sas6, the entire −2.5 to 2.5 line scan was used to fit the Gaussian curve, for all other proteins two independent curves were generated along the −2.5 to 0.0 and 0.0 to 2.5 positions. For the γTub and Cnn within the PCM zone, a Gaussian Blur tool in ImageJ was used to smooth the edges of the PCM such that the fitted Gaussian produced an R<sup>2</sup> &gt;0.90 (Fig. S1 B). Comparisons of individual native and blurred line scans indicate a negligible impact of the blurring function on position measurements. For OE measurements of PLP satellites and Cnn flares, a half-Gaussian curve was fitted to the distal edge of the flare. A mirror image of this curve was added to generate the full-Gaussian from which μ and SD were calculated (Fig. S1 B, OE flare).</p><p>Cytoplasmic Cnn flares (not continuous with the centrosome or satellites) were manually counted from a 20 × 20-µm (400 µm<sup>2</sup>) box from three random areas in at least five different embryos for each genotype and cell cycle stage.

        <p>The fission yeast cytoskeleton is completely reorganized upon quiescence entry: the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton is drastically reshaped as quiescent cells assemble a large spindle pole body–associated MT bundle composed of stable antiparallel MTs.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Cells perpetually face the decision to proliferate or to stay quiescent. Here we show that upon quiescence establishment, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> cells drastically rearrange both their actin and microtubule (MT) cytoskeletons and lose their polarity. Indeed, while polarity markers are lost from cell extremities, actin patches and cables are reorganized into actin bodies, which are stable actin filament–containing structures. Astonishingly, MTs are also stabilized and rearranged into a novel antiparallel bundle associated with the spindle pole body, named Q-MT bundle. We have identified proteins involved in this process and propose a molecular model for Q-MT bundle formation. Finally and importantly, we reveal that Q-MT bundle elongation is involved in polarity reestablishment upon quiescence exit and thereby the efficient return to the proliferative state. Our work demonstrates that quiescent <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells assemble specific cytoskeleton structures that improve the swiftness of the transition back to proliferation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Microtubules (MT) are hollow cylindrical polymers that are essential in all eukaryotic cells. They are formed by the non-covalent interaction of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers. MTs are nucleated at MT organizing centers (MTOCs) by a γ-tubulin–containing complex that acts as a MT template. As a MTOC stays attached to MT, it stabilizes the so-called MT minus end (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Kollman et al., 2011</xref>). At the opposite end, the plus end, MTs elongate by the addition of GTP tubulin. During assembly, the β-tubulin–bound GTP is hydrolyzed and a stable GDP+Pi tubulin intermediate is generated. The eventual Pi release causes a change in tubulin–tubulin interaction that favors MT depolymerization (catastrophe) that can be rescued by de novo GTP tubulin addition (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Carlier and Pantaloni, 1981</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Nogales and Wang, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Alushin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Mitchison, 2014</xref>). In fact, MT plus ends are thought to be protected from catastrophe by a stabilizing GTP tubulin “cap” (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Horio and Murata, 2014</xref>). Thus, MTs alternate periods of growth and shrinkage, a behavior called dynamic instability (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>). In vivo, this dynamic is regulated by plethora of MT-associated proteins (MAPs) that modulate MT length by influencing the polymerization or depolymerization rates and/or the catastrophe or rescue frequencies (<xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Wade, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">van der Vaart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Horio and Murata, 2014</xref>). Finally, other MAPs are involved in MT organization into diverse structures such as asters, spindles, or bundles, each of which is required for a particular cellular process. One of the key questions is therefore how cells can spatially and temporally control the assembly of distinct MT-containing structures to elicit specific cellular functions.</p>
      <p>Fission yeast has proven to be a powerful model to study how different MT structures are constructed all along the cell cycle (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Hagan, 1998</xref>). Depending on the cell cycle stage, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> displays three different classes of MTOCs. In mitosis, the spindle pole body (SPB), a yeast MTOC equivalent to the centrosome, nucleates MTs that form the mitotic spindle required for chromosome segregation. After mitosis completion, an equatorial MTOC appears as a ring in the cell center and nucleates a post-anaphase array of MTs involved in cell septation during cytokinesis. After cell division, the equatorial MTOC breaks down to form multiple interphase MTOCs that localize all around the nuclear membrane. The SPB stays linked to the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope and can possibly nucleate interphase MT. Thus, in interphase, fission yeast cells display three to five long MT bundles that extend along the long axis of the cell (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Hagan and Petersen, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Sawin and Tran, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>Interphase MT bundles are composed of about four dynamic antiparallel MTs (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Drummond and Cross, 2000</xref>). The formation of these structures relies on the Mto1/2 complex that recruits and activates the γ-tubulin–containing complex on the cytoplasmic face of the SPB, at nuclear membrane–associated interphase MTOCs, and onto preexisting MTs, thus allowing the nucleation of new MTs (<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Venkatram et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Janson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Samejima et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Zimmerman and Chang, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Lynch et al., 2014</xref>). In the latter case, the newly nucleated MT is pulled toward the minus end of the underneath MT template via the motor activity of the kinesin-14 Klp2, until Ase1, a homodimeric MT bundling protein, acts as a brake (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Carazo-Salas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Carazo-Salas and Nurse, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Janson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Braun et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The MT length is regulated by several MT plus end tracking proteins including Mal3 (the EB1 homologue) and Tip1 (the Clip170 homologue), two proteins that favor MT rescue (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Beinhauer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Brunner and Nurse, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Busch and Brunner, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Höög et al., 2013</xref>), Alp14 (a TOG orthologue) that has a MT polymerase activity (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Al-Bassam et al., 2012</xref>), and the kinesins-8 Klp5 and Klp6 that promote catastrophe (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Unsworth et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Tischer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Erent et al., 2012</xref>). This complex interplay between diverse MAPs results in a typical interphase MT bundle organization, such as within the bundle the overlapping stable MT minus ends are found near the nucleus whereas the dynamic plus ends are extending toward the cell tips (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Drummond and Cross, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Piel and Tran, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Hachet et al., 2012</xref>). This dynamic arrangement enables the MT plus ends to produce a balance of pushing forces that position the nucleus at the center of the cell (<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Tran et al., 2001</xref>) and will ultimately lead to a symmetrical cell division (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Daga and Chang, 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>Interphase MT bundles have an additional physiological function. Just after division, cells initiate growth at the preexisting cell end, the old end. Dynamic interphase MTs play an active role in this process. Indeed, by touching the cell cortex, growing MT plus ends deliver polarity factors to cell extremity. One of these factors, the Kelch repeat–containing protein Tea1, docks onto its membrane-associated receptor, the prenylated protein Mod5 (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Snaith and Sawin, 2003</xref>). Once at the cell tip, Tea1 recruits the Formin For3 and its associated partners, such as Bud6, enabling the nucleation of actin filaments that will be subsequently assembled into actin cables. Actin cables will then serve as tracks for the myosin V–dependent polarized transport of all the building blocks required for cell growth. Hence, in interphase, MTs establish the site of polarized growth and mutations that impinge on interphase MT bundle organization or dynamics consequently affect cell shape (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Martin, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Martin, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Hachet et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>Like other eukaryotes, upon nutrient exhaustion, <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells stop growth and proliferation and enter a temporary non-dividing state called quiescence (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Sajiki et al., 2009</xref>). While quiescence may encompass very different physiological situations depending on the nature of the exhausted nutrient (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Costello et al., 1986</xref>), it is clear that fission yeast quiescence establishment is accompanied by profound modifications of the cell transcriptome, proteome (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Marguerat et al., 2012</xref>), and metabolome (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Sajiki et al., 2013</xref>) and by the acquisition of a variety of features including an enhanced resistance to harmful external conditions or the accumulation of storage molecules (<xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 1996</xref>). We have previously shown that upon carbon source exhaustion, the fission yeast proteasome exits the nucleus and forms a specific cytoplasmic structure called proteasome storage granule (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Laporte et al., 2008</xref>). Such relocalization has also been reported in budding yeast (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Laporte et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, actin filaments collapse into actin bodies (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Sagot et al., 2006</xref>), and various chaperones (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Tapia and Morano, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), enzymes (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Noree et al., 2010</xref>), or kinases (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al., 2014</xref>) are relocalized upon quiescence entry. Some of these reorganizations have been observed in metazoans (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Noree et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that they may be conserved among eukaryotes.</p>
      <p>In this study, we show that fission yeast cytoskeletons are completely reorganized upon quiescence entry. Indeed, we primarily observed that the MT cytoskeleton is drastically reshaped as quiescent cells assemble a large SPB-associated MT bundle composed of astonishingly stable antiparallel MTs. Importantly, we also report that quiescence establishment comes along with a massive rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and the loss of cell polarity. We finally demonstrate that quiescent cell MT elongation is strictly required for cell polarity reestablishment upon quiescence exit.</p>

        <title>Upon quiescence entry, <italic>S. pombe</italic> reorganizes its MT cytoskeleton as a single bundle linked to the SPB</title>
        <p>Upon carbon source exhaustion, fission yeast cells leave the cell cycle and enter quiescence from interphase (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bostock, 1970</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Costello et al., 1986</xref>). In these conditions, we have analyzed MT organization in wild-type (WT) cells expressing the α-tubulin 2 (Atb2) fused to GFP. As expected, proliferating interphase cells displayed two to five long cytoplasmic bundles composed of 4 ± 1 MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Höög et al., 2007</xref>). Strikingly, we observed that after carbon exhaustion, the number of MT bundles progressively decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Four days after carbon exhaustion, the majority of the cells displayed a single MT bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref> and Fig. S1 A) that we named Q-MT bundle, standing for quiescent cell MT bundle. This unique MT bundle was composed of more than 15 MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>) that were not necessarily of the same length, as exemplified by the arrow shape of the bundle extremities (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201502025/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1 B</ext-link>). In fact, in ∼15% of the cells, the Q-MT bundle could display internal thickness variations (Fig. S1 C). Importantly, by imaging cells coexpressing GFP-Atb2 with the SPB-associated protein Sfi1 fused to CFP and the nuclear membrane protein Cut11 fused to RFP, we observed that the Q-MT bundle was generally associated with the SPB (&gt;70% of the cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C, D, and G</xref>), even when quiescence was prolonged (Fig. S1 D). Yet, MT bundles not associated with the SPB displayed the same length and intensity than the SBP-associated ones (Fig. S1, E and F). EM analysis of quiescent WT cells showed that within the Q-MT bundle MTs were regularly spaced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D–G</xref>; and Fig. S1 G). Finally, the Q-MT bundle organization and localization within the cell were confirmed by 3D models constructed using serial section electron tomograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>).</p>

        <title>MT stabilization is not primarily caused by GTP depletion but rather involves the SPB</title>
        <p>Tubulin binds GTP and can hydrolyze this nucleotide. The influence of the tubulin nucleotide status on MT dynamics in vivo is still a mater of debate (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Kueh and Mitchison, 2009</xref>).

        <title>A variety of MAPs colocalizes with the Q-MT bundle and influences its length or thickness</title>
        <p>To get insights into the mechanism of Q-MT bundle formation, we looked for MAPs colocalizing with this structure. First, we found that astonishingly, in quiescent cells, Mto1 and Mto2 were no longer found as dots around the nuclear envelope but rather localized exclusively onto the Q-MT bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201502025/DC1" id="supp3">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>). Line scan analyses revealed that Mto1/2 localized as dots that most likely mark the MT ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref> and Fig. S3 A), in agreement with Mto1/2 being a MT minus end binding complex (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Sawin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Venkatram et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Samejima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Janson et al., 2007</xref>). Second, the regular spacing between MTs within the Q-MT bundle observed by EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>) strongly suggested the presence of a MT bundling protein, and, accordingly, we found that Ase1 localized all along the Q-MT bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the CLASP family member Cls1 (Peg1) has been involved in MT stabilization and is known to localize to the overlapping zone of interphase MT bundle (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bratman and Chang, 2007</xref>). Similarly, in quiescent cells, we found that Cls1 localized with the denser region of the Q-MT bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Finally, the MT plus end tracking proteins Alp7 (the TACC protein orthologue) and Alp14 and Dis1 (two TOG-related proteins) localized as dots that probably correspond to MT extremities within the Q-MT bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>), just like the MT minus end–directed kinesin-14 Klp2, although fewer and fainter Klp2 dots were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>).

However, in some mutants, whereas the steady-state level of total α-tubulin remained constant (Fig. S3 B), the Q-MT bundle was either both thicker and longer (<italic>klp5Δklp</italic>6<italic>Δ</italic>, <italic>alp7Δ</italic>, and <italic>dis1Δ</italic>), just thinner (<italic>ase1Δ</italic>), or both shorter and thinner (<italic>mal3Δ</italic> and <italic>alp14Δ</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, E and F</xref>).

In ∼5 min, dynamic MTs polymerizing from the Q-MT bundle touched the cell poles. Of note, tracking SPB movement upon quiescence exit clearly demonstrated that the Q-MT bundle was attached to the SPB (Fig. S4 E). The MT plus end–tracking protein Alp14, although immobile onto the Q-MT bundle in quiescence (Fig. S4 F), was found at the tip of elongating MTs upon quiescence exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5 B</xref> and S4 F). In contrast, the minus end–associated protein Mto2 stayed immobile on the elongating Q-MT bundle (Fig. S4 G). Later (&gt;15 min), new MT bundles were assembled de novo at the nuclear periphery. Interestingly, as for other quiescent cell-specific structures (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Laporte et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), the sole addition of glucose onto quiescent cells trigged both Q-MT bundle elongation and assembly of new interphase MT bundles at the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>).

This was confirmed by the absence of variation of the Q-MT bundle fluorescence intensity for at least 20 min after cell refeeding in the presence of CHX alone (Fig. S4 H). Obviously, a TBZ treatment prevented de novo interphase MT bundle formation at the nuclear membrane. As a control, we showed that inhibiting MT polymerization upon quiescence exit did not influence Q-MT bundle stability. Indeed when quiescent cells were refed with new medium in the presence of CHX, and afterward incubated 10 min with MBC (Fig. S4 I), Q-MT bundle length and fluorescence intensity stayed constant for at least 20 min, whereas MT dynamic was clearly recovered. In fact, Q-MT bundles start to disassemble only 1 h after cells refeeding (Fig. S4 I). Collectively these data demonstrated that a free tubulin pool was present in quiescent cell cytoplasm and that MT elongation upon quiescence exit was caused by free tubulin polymerization at the Q-MT bundle extremities.</p>

        <title>Q-MT bundle elongation is required for polarity reestablishment upon quiescence exit</title>
        <p>Upon quiescence exit, we found that cells rapidly repolarized. Indeed, within minutes, Tea1 returned to the cell tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>) as did Tip1 and Pob1 (Fig. S5 B). In parallel, actin bodies quickly disassembled and actin patches reassembled at the cells extremities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>, Fim1, Acp2, and App1; and Fig. S5 B, Bud6).

        <p>To decipher the potential role of the Q-MT bundle in cell repolarization upon quiescence exit, cells exiting quiescence were treated with MBC, a drug that prevents MT bundle elongation and de novo interphase MT bundle formation at the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5 C</xref> and S5 C). In these conditions, we found that repolarization of Tea1 and the actin components Fim1, Acp2, and App1 was impaired in &gt;60% of the cells and drastically delayed in the remaining 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). At later time points, these polarity defects translated into major cell shape defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>) that were not observed in the control experiments done with proliferating cells. This strongly suggested that Q-MT bundle elongation and the return to dynamic MT was required for polarity reestablishment upon quiescence exit.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, we found that quiescent <italic>alp14Δ</italic> cells were incapable of Q-MT elongation and interphase bundle reassembly upon refeeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, C and D</xref>). This later defect was not the result of an impaired relocalization of Mto1/2 onto the nuclear membrane (Fig. S5 E). This demonstrated that Alp14 was required for Q-MT bundle elongation. Further, as MBC treated cells, <italic>alp14Δ</italic> cells displayed a strong cell shape defect upon quiescence exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>), another proof of the involvement of the Q-MT bundle elongation in cell repolarization upon quiescence exit.</p>
        <p>To definitively address this point, we used <italic>mto1Δ</italic>, a mutant known to be unable to nucleate cytoplamic MTs (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Sawin et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, after 5 d, <italic>mto1Δ</italic> cells do not assemble a bona fide Q-MT bundle but instead display a unique long and thin MT-containing structure composed of MTs that are sensitive to a cold treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, E and F</xref>). As <italic>mto1Δ</italic> cells are unable to nucleate cytoplasmic MTs, a shift back to 30°C after a cold treatment did not allow de novo MT polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref> and not depicted). Using this mutant, we were able to get rid of MTs in quiescence and address the phenotype of cells exiting quiescence in the absence of MTs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref> (E and F), the vast majority of the cold-treated <italic>mto1Δ</italic> cells exiting quiescence without MT exhibit strong polarity and shape defects (see also Fig. S5 F).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we have shown that when fission yeast cells enter quiescence after carbon source exhaustion, they remodel their MT cytoskeleton into a unique MT bundle (Q-MT bundle). This Q-MT bundle is composed of more than 15 stable and regularly spaced antiparallel MTs. Importantly, this structure is associated with the SPB, a MTOC that seems to be involved in Q-MT bundle MT stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). We have also observed that the actin cytoskeleton is drastically reshaped as cells disassemble actin patches and cables and assemble actin bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>), stable F-actin–containing structures (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Sagot et al., 2006</xref>). In parallel, polarity markers, such as Cdc42, the exocyst components, and Tea1, are lost from cell tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). All these rearrangements result in a loss of cell polarity in quiescence. When cells exit quiescence, the Q-MT bundle immediately elongates from both extremities and actin bodies dissociate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Within an hour, a typical interphase organization is restored, i.e., three to four thin and dynamic MT bundles extend along the long axis of the cell, actin patches and cables assemble at cell tips, and cells start to grow in a polarized manner.</p>
      <sec id="s11">
        <title>What are the molecular mechanisms involved in Q-MT bundle formation?</title>
        <p>Upon quiescence establishment, the SBP-associated MT bundle rapidly becomes more stable compared with other MT bundles present in the cell cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>, <italic>t</italic> + 6 h). Within &lt;2 d after carbon exhaustion, the SPB-associated MT bundle is fully resistant to treatments that destabilize dynamic MTs. This stabilization will be discussed below. As a second step toward Q-MT bundle formation, we propose that the binding of Mto1/2 onto the SPB-associated MTs allows the nucleation of new MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>, step 2). The displacement of the equilibrium toward de novo MT nucleation by Mto1/2-activated γ-tubulin onto the stable SPB-associated MT bundle may be favored by the concomitant loss of Mto1/2 affinity for the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). As a result, new MTs would pile up onto the SPB-associated MT bundle that progressively thicken, helped by MT bundling activities, including the one of Ase1 (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Loïodice et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>) and Clasp (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bratman and Chang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>, steps 3 and 4). Interestingly, MAPs that regulate the thickness and the length of interphase MT bundles also influence the Q-MT bundle shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Indeed, both in interphase and in quiescence, MT bundles are shorter in a <italic>mal3Δ</italic> mutant (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Beinhauer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, D to F</xref>) or longer in a <italic>klp5Δklp6Δ</italic> mutant (<xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">West et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, D to F</xref>), in agreement with the molecular activities of these proteins that, respectively, promote MT rescue or catastrophe (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Unsworth et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Tischer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Erent et al., 2012</xref>). Alp14 has a MT polymerase activity in vitro (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Al-Bassam et al., 2012</xref>) and, accordingly, <italic>alp14Δ</italic> cells display both shorter interphase MT bundles (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Al-Bassam et al., 2012</xref>) and shorter Q-MT bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, D–F</xref>). Furthermore, just like interphase MT bundles in proliferating <italic>alp7Δ</italic> cells (<xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>), the Q-MT bundle is longer in quiescent <italic>alp7Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, D–F</xref>). Finally, consistent with Ase1 bundling activity (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Loïodice et al., 2005</xref>), we found that the Q-MT bundle is thinner in quiescent <italic>ase1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, D–F</xref>). The Q-MT bundle formation may therefore hypothetically rely on a self-assembling mechanisms similar to the one proposed for interphase MT bundles (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Carazo-Salas and Nurse, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Daga et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Carazo-Salas and Nurse, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Janson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian and Kapoor, 2012</xref>).</p>

        <title>How to explain MT stability in quiescence?</title>
        <p>During proliferation, nearly 100% of the cells display SPB-associated MTs. In quiescence, ∼75% of the Q-MT bundles are associated with the SPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1 C</xref> and S1 D). We have never directly observed a Q-MT bundle “detaching” from the SBP. Therefore, whether free Q-MT bundles result from SPB detachment events or if their stabilization occurred independently of the SPB remain an open question. Yet, whether they are SPB associated or not, Q-MT bundles have an apparent constant length and contain MTs that are insensitive to treatments that destabilize dynamic MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2</xref>, S1 [E and F], and S2 [A and B]).</p>
        <p>The molecular events leading to MT stabilization within the Q-MT bundle are still unknown. We can speculate that an enhanced MT cross-linking activity specifically associated with the Q-MT bundle may prevent its depolymerization. Upon quiescence entry, the SPB-associated bundle may recruit proteins that will either modify the bundling activity of known MT cross-linkers, such as Ase1, or load quiescence-specific MT bundling proteins that remain to be identified.</p>
        <p>However, an increased MT bundling activity does not explain why MTs apparently do not elongate. We cannot rule out that residual polymerization/depolymerization cycles occur at the MT plus ends. In this scenario, MT elongation would be undetectable using classic fluorescence microscopy because the equilibrium between growth and shrinkage would be displaced toward depolymerization, for example, through the activation of a MT depolymerase. An alternative possibility could be that upon quiescence entry, a MT plus end “capper” would be recruited specifically onto the SPB-associated Q-MT bundle. Although no MT-capping activity has been identified to date, we can envision that a MT plus end tracker, such as a TOG domain–containing protein, for example, could lock MT plus ends, thereby preventing tubulin addition. Finally, the absence of detectable MT elongation in quiescent cells could result from the lack of free polymerizable tubulin. However, we have clearly shown that a free tubulin pool is present in the quiescent cell cytoplasm. Indeed, upon cell refeeding, the Q-MT bundle elongates, even if the de novo protein synthesis is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and C</xref>). This elongation occurs without any detectable Q-MT bundle depolymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5 C</xref> and S4, H and I). Could the quiescent cell–free tubulin pool be unable to polymerize? We have shown that quiescence entry is associated with a drastic decrease of the GTP intracellular pool. Yet, an artificial GTP concentration drop does not influence MT dynamic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> A–C</xref>), at least within early time points. Further, in vitro experiments have demonstrated that GDP tubulin can polymerize given that few GTP tubulin dimers are present (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Valiron et al., 2010</xref>). As GTP seems not to be involved, we can speculate that in quiescent cells, free tubulin cannot add on MT ends either because of a posttranslational modification or a tubulin dimer sequestering protein.</p>

        <title>Q-MT bundle elongation upon quiescence exit</title>
        <p>Whatever the mechanism responsible for the absence of MT dynamics in quiescence, Q-MT bundle elongation is rapidly triggered by glucose upon quiescence exit. This swift event, which does not depend on de novo protein synthesis, probably relies on signaling cascades involving nutrient catabolism (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Laporte et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, we have shown that Q-MT bundle elongation requires Alp14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, C and D</xref>), a protein displaying MT polymerase activity (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Al-Bassam et al., 2012</xref>). In interphase, Alp14 is not strictly required for MT elongation, probably because its absence is compensated by a protein with a similar activity. In quiescence, this compensating activity may be inhibited or absent. Consequently, Alp14 would be needed for feeding the elongating Q-MT bundle plus ends upon quiescence exit. This is in agreement with the observation that Alp14 stays poised onto the Q-MT bundle plus ends in quiescence and follows MT elongation upon quiescence exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Importantly, we have demonstrated that Q-MT bundle elongation and the recovery of MT dynamics is necessary for an efficient quiescence exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figs. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8 B</xref>). Indeed, cells in which the Q-MT bundle elongation is inhibited either pharmacologically or by the deletion of Alp14 exhibit profound cell shape defects. In these cells, polarity markers relocalize to unspecific cortical regions, leading to a random actin repolarization and ultimately to a branched or triangular cell shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). This abnormal cell repolarization upon quiescence exit is a functional proof of the cell polarity loss in quiescence. Further, it explains the long standing observation that mutants impaired for MT dynamic or polarity factors, such as <italic>tea1Δ</italic> mutant, exhibit more T-shaped cells after a starvation period than during proliferation (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Browning et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Snaith and Sawin, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Sawin and Snaith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

        <title>Why would cells need to reorganize their cytoskeletons upon quiescence establishment?</title>
        <p>We have previously shown that when budding yeast cells enter quiescence after glucose exhaustion, they assemble a stable MT bundle emanating from the SPB (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>). Yet, in contrast to the fission yeast cytoplasmic Q-MT bundle, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> stable MT array is nuclear and composed of parallel MTs (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Laporte and Sagot, 2014</xref>). We do not know what the rationales for these structural differences are, and a wide range of speculations based on various physiological differences between these two species can be drawn. It is intriguing that in both yeasts SPB-associated MTs are stabilized. Could the SPB be a platform that integrates nutritional signals and translates them into MT cytoskeleton reorganizations?</p>
        <p>All quiescent cells need to preserve their ability to proliferate and must produce a healthy progeny (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Coller, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">O’Farrell, 2011</xref>). For microorganisms competing for an environmental niche, quiescence exit must be efficient to guarantee the prevalence of the species. Upon quiescence entry, we have shown that <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells reorganize both their MT and their actin cytoskeletons to form stable structures (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Sagot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>; this study). Whether these reorganizations are just a passive consequence or actively participate in the process of quiescence establishment is a critical question (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Daignan-Fornier and Sagot, 2011a</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Actin and tubulin are very abundant proteins required for cell growth and division. The degradation or the damaging of these proteins in quiescence would require their resynthesis to allow proliferation resumption. This step would need a large amount of amino acids and energy and would require some time that may negatively impinge on the swift reentry into the proliferation cycle. Protein damage might to be a major cause of cell death during a long-term nonproliferative state. Might actin and tubulin be better protected from external damages when packed up into stable polymers rather than as free monomers in the cytoplasm? To definitively address the requirement for actin bodies and stable MT-containing bundles for yeast cell survival in quiescence, conditional mutants or experimental procedures to transiently disassemble these structures in quiescence need to be found.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, here, we have uncovered a physiological function for a quiescent cell–specific structure, as we have shown that fission yeast Q-MT bundle elongation is mandatory for an efficient quiescence exit. As such, this structure clearly participates in the fitness of <italic>S. pombe</italic>, a single-celled eukaryote in competition with numerous other species. Moreover, our study sheds light on the conservation of the reorganization and stabilization of both the actin and the MT cytoskeletons upon quiescence establishment in two phylogenetically distant unicellular eukaryote species. One obvious direction for future studies is to address this conservation in multicellular organisms.</p>

For cold treatment, cells were shifted at 4°C for the indicated time, and then shifted back to 30°C and imaged. For drug treatments, cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml MBC (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2 mg/ml benomyl (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mg/ml TBZ (Sigma-Aldrich), or 180 µM CHX (Sigma-Aldrich) for the indicated time. These concentrations are 10 times higher than the one commonly used with proliferating cells. For quiescence exit in the presence of drugs, cells were preincubated 1 h in the presence of the drug before quiescence exit. For quiescence exit in the sole presence of glucose, cells were washed twice with water, inoculated at OD<sub>600nm</sub> = 2 in a solution containing 2% glucose, and incubated at 30°C. Cell viability was addressed after cell incubation for 5 min in a solution containing 0.2% of methylene blue (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2% sodium citrate (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 7. In this study, all experiments were at least duplicated and for each time point, unless specified, &gt;200 cells were scored.</p>

        <p>High pressure ionic chromatography experiments were done as described previously (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Hürlimann et al., 2011</xref>). In brief, cellular extracts were prepared by an ethanol extraction. Cells were harvested by rapid filtration, immediately dropped into 5 ml ethanol/10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2 (4/1 vol/vol), and incubated at 80°C for 3 min. Samples were evaporated using a rotavapor apparatus. Residues were resuspended in water and insoluble particles were eliminated by centrifugation. Separation of metabolites was performed on a CarboPac PA1 column, linked to a chromatography workstation (ICS3000; Dionex), using a sodium hydroxide/sodium acetate (50–800 mM) gradient. Nucleotide derivatives were detected with a UV diode array detector (Ultimate 3000RS; Dionex). MPA (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at the final concentration of 100 µg/ml. Guanine was used at the final concentration of 0.3 mM in 0.1 M sodium hydroxide.</p>

        <p>For immunofluorescence experiments, cells were harvested by rapid filtration and fixed by washing the filter with methanol at −20°C. Cells were further processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Mata and Nurse, 1997</xref>). Anti-tubulin staining used the TAT1 monoclonal tissue culture supernatant (gift of K. Gull, Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford, UK; <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Woods et al., 1989</xref>) at 1:15 followed by Alexa Fluor 488–goat anti–mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) at 1:500.</p>
        <p>For actin phalloidin staining, cells were fixed 1 h with freshly made paraformaldehyde (3.8% final [Sigma-Aldrich] in PEM [0.1 M Pipes, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, pH 6.9, with 5 N sodium hydroxide]), vortexed every 10 min for 1 h at 70°C, and then centrifuged 5 min at 3,000 rpm. Cells were then washed twice with PEM and resuspended in 1.5 ml PEM + 1% Triton X-100. Proliferating and quiescent cells were incubated for 30 s and 3 min, respectively. Samples were then washed twice in 1.5 ml PEM and resuspended for 24 h at 4°C in PEM containing 1/10 V of Alexa Fluor Phalloidin (Invitrogen). Finally, cells were washed twice, resuspended in a mounting solution containing 70% glycerol and 5 mg/l paraphenylenediamine, and imaged at room temperature as described previously (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Sagot et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
        <p>For MT behavior after cold experiment (Fig. S2 A), samples were fixed 1 min with formaldehyde (3.8% final; Sigma-Aldrich), washed, resuspended in a mounting solution as above, and imaged.</p>

        <title>Fluorescence microscopy</title>
        <p>Cells were observed in a fully automated inverted microscope (Axiovert 200M; Carl Zeiss) equipped with a stage (MS-2000; Applied Scientific Instrumentation), a 300-W xenon light source (Lambda LS; Sutter Instrument), a 100× 1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat objective, and a five-position filter turret. For GFP imaging, we used a FITC filter (excitation, HQ487/25; emission, HQ535/40; beam splitter, Q505lp). For RFP imaging, we used a Cy3 filter (excitation, HQ535/50; emission, HQ610/75; beam splitter, Q565lp). For CFP imaging, we used a CFP filter (excitation, HQ436/20; emission, HQ480/40; beam splitter, 455dclp). For YFP imaging, we used a YFP filter (excitation, HQ500/20; emission, HQ535/30; beam splitter, Q515lp). All the filters were purchased from Chroma Technology Corp. Images were acquired using a CoolSnap HQ camera (Roper Scientific). The microscope, camera, and shutters (Uniblitz) were controlled by SlideBook software 5.0 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). Images are, unless specified, 2D maximal projection of Z-stacks performed using a 0.3-µm step. For live cell imaging, 2 µl of the cell culture were spotted onto a glass slide and immediately imaged at room temperature.</p>
        <p>For fluorescence intensity measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1 B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4 F</xref>, S1 F, and S4 I), a line scan (i1) of <italic>n</italic> pixel width (three to eight, depending on the binning acquisitions parameters) containing both GFP signal and background was drawn along MTs using ImageJ software. A line of 2n pixel width at the same location was drawn to calculate the intensity of the surrounding background (i2). The real intensity (ir) was calculated as follow: ib = (i2 × Area i2) − (i1 × Area i1) and ir = i1 − [ib/(Area i2 − Area i)]. To calculate the number of MTs per structure, individual MT fluorescence was determined by three methods: the fluorescence intensity was measured in proliferation cell on either one MT growing or on the nonoverlapping or overlapping region of the spindle, described to contain 11 MTs (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 1993</xref>). According to these measurements for a single MT, fluorescence intensity measured upon quiescence entry was converted in MT numbers.</p>
        <p>To measure MT length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs. 4 E</xref> and S1 E), positions of the MT-containing structure extremities were followed over time and compared with a fixed point in the cell using MTrackJ plugin (ImageJ). Euclidian distances (D) between two positions over time were calculated as D = √[(x2 − x1)<sup>2</sup> + (y2 − y1)<sup>2</sup>]. In time-lapse series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>), the first measured length was set to zero. The same protocol was applied to measure MT dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>) and SPB movement in quiescence and upon exit (Fig. S4 E). To measure MT dynamics, four z-frames were acquired every 4 s on proliferating cells treated or not with MPA (2 h). After using a rolling average filter (i.e, the MT extremity fix-point length [w] is the mean of w − 1, w, and w + 1 values), the length was plotted over time and growth/shrinkage speed was calculated over a 300-s observation period.</p>
        <p>FRAP experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>) was done as previously described (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>). Experiments were done on an inverted microscope (DMI 6000; Leica) equipped with a spinning disk confocal head (CSU-X1; Yokogawa Electric Corporation), a QuantEM camera (Photometrics), and a scanner FRAP system (Roper Scientific). The diode lasers used were at 408 and 491 nm. The objective used was an HCX PL APO CS 100× oil with 1.4 NA. The Z-stacks were done with an objective scanner (Piezo P721.LLQ; Physik Instrumente). This system was controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Recovery from photobleaching was monitored in time-lapse mode. Fluorescence recovery was corrected for background noise and continuous photobleaching using the ImageJ software. Fluorescence was then normalized using a rolling average filter (i.e, the fluorescence intensity y is the mean intensity of y − 1, y, and y + 1). The fluorescence was then normalized to the one measured before bleach (<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Vavylonis et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
        <p>For line scan analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>; and Fig. S3 A), the real measured intensities (ir) were set to percent, with 100% being the maximum calculated along the line. Slopes were manually aligned to zero, with zero being when ir &gt; 0. The same protocol was applied to compare the different slopes after line scan analysis (Fig. S1, B and C).</p>
        <p>Mander’s colocalization coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>) were calculated using ImageJ software as described in <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Jimenez et al. (2014)</xref>. In brief, Z-stacks were first maximum projected and cells were individually selected in both GFP and RFP channels. The same threshold was applied for each channel and signals were binarized (i.e., pixel &lt; threshold = 0 and pixel &gt; threshold = 255). The percentages of GFP pixel (Mto2-GFP signal) that colocalize with RFP pixel (RFP-Atb2 signal) were determined using the JACoP plugin (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>).</p>
        <p>For Q-MT bundle fluorescence measurements upon quiescence exit (Fig. S4 H), a line scan of 8-pixel width was drawn along Q-MT bundle using ImageJ software. The fluorescence intensities were measured in function of time and were corrected for photobleaching. Photobleaching was measured on Q-MT bundles in quiescence images with the same acquisitions conditions.</p>
        <p>To calculate the theoretical stabilization of MT upon quiescence entry, we started with the mean number (N) of MT bundles observed for cells before treatment (i.e., for 6 h after carbon exhaustion [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>] the mean number of MT bundle per cell N was 2.7 and for 42 h [Fig. S2 D] N was 3.3). We noted n<sub>i-single</sub>, the initial percentage of cells with only a single MT bundle. We noted n<sub>multi-before</sub> and n<sub>multi-after</sub>, the percentage of cells with more than one MT bundle observed before and after benomyl treatment, respectively. For each time point, Δ<sub>n-multi</sub> is equal to n<sub>multi-before</sub> − n<sub>multi-after</sub>. For the random stabilization model, we considered that 1/N of the MT bundle is stabilized, regardless of the association with the SPB. Thus, for each time point, the prediction of the percentage of cells that should display a single MT bundle associated for the SPB is (1/N × Δ<sub>n-multi</sub>) + n<sub>i-single</sub>. For the nonrandom stabilization, we considered that only the MT bundle associated with the SPB is stabilized. Thus, for each time point, the prediction of the percentage of cells that should display a single MT bundle associated for the SPB is (Δ<sub>n-multi</sub>) + n<sub>i-single</sub>.</p>

        <p>Freezing, freeze substitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>), and immunostaining (Fig. S1 G) were performed as described previously (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>). In brief, cells were washed with glycine, and then with fetal calf serum, and incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-Tat1 (the <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> α-tubulin) antibodies diluted 1:250 (a gift of K. Gull; <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Woods et al., 1989</xref>). After a wash with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated for 45 min at room temperature with anti–mouse IgG conjugated to 10-nm gold particles (BioCell Laboratories, Inc.). For freeze substitution, yeast were deposited on a copper grid (400 mesh) coated with Formvar. Grids were immersed in liquid propane held at −180°C by liquid nitrogen and then transferred in a 4% osmium tetroxide solution in dry acetone at −82°C for 72 h. Grids were then shifted to room temperature and washed three times with dry acetone. Cell were stained with 1% uranyl acetate and then washed once with dry acetone. Samples were gradually unfiltered with araldite (Fluka). Ultra-thin sections were contrasted with lead citrate and observed in an electron microscope (80 kV; 7650; Hitachi) at the EM facility of the Bordeaux Imaging Center.</p>
        <p>For tomography analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>), 150-nm-thick sections were placed on formvar-coated 150-mesh copper grids and poststained 1 min with lead citrate 2% in water. Images were acquired using a Spirit Twin (FEI Tecnai) operated at 120 kV. Images were recorded with a 4k Eagle charge coupled device camera system (FEI Tecnai) at a nominal magnification of 30,000 (sample D7) or 26,000 (sample C10) using a –65 to 65 tilt for Cell 1 or a −65 to 39 for Cell 2 with 2° increments. Tomography tilt series were taken using the batch tomography software (FEI Tecnai). They were then aligned, cropped, and binned using the ETomo program from the IMOD suite. The 3D tomography reconstructed visualization was done using Amira Resolve RT 5.2.0.</p>
        <p>For MT distance measurements between two MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>), the centroid of each MT was determined and the Euclidian distance was determined as D = {√[(x2 − x1)<sup>2</sup> + (y2 − y1)<sup>2</sup>]}. This distance was then subtracted for the two MTs’ radiuses (∼22 nm). Gaussian fit on these values was then determined using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software).</p>

  <body>
    <p>Cilia hoist dust out of the lungs, propel sperm toward the egg, and enable us to catch the scent of fresh coffee. The structures also help some cells attach to their surroundings, <related-article id="d35e78" related-article-type="article-reference" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1083/jcb.201501013">Schouteden et al.</related-article> reveal (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p>
    <p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><caption><p><bold>FOCAL POINT</bold>  (Top row, left to right) Clementine Schouteden, Mate Palfy, Daniel Serwas, and Alexander Dammermann investigated the role of the protein CCEP-290 in the transition zone of cilia. They found that the transition zone isn’t necessary for forming the axoneme of a cilium, but it does help certain neurons attach to surfaces. (Bottom row) In this time series of a developing worm, the cell bodies of neurons (green) migrate away from their dendrites, which are anchored by cilia.</p><p>PHOTOS COURTESY OF DAMMERMANN LAB (SCHOUTEDEN); FRANZISKA FRIEDRICH, MPI-CBG (PALFY); AND HARALD KOTISCH (SERWAS AND DAMMERMANN)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_2101if_Fig1"/></fig>A cilium is built around the axoneme, an internal shaft of microtubules that sprouts from a structure known as the basal body. Between the axoneme and the basal body lies the transition zone, whose distinctive architecture includes a central cylinder and so-called Y-links that fasten the axoneme to the membrane of the cilium. Researchers are still trying to determine the transition zone’s functions. It may serve as a gate to control which molecules move into the cilium (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Some evidence also supports the notion that the transition zone promotes cilium assembly (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p>
    <p>By studying ciliopathies, genetic diseases in which cilia are faulty, researchers have discovered three protein complexes that reside in the transition zone: MKS, NPHP, and CEP290. The roles of the individual complexes are unclear. However, research in <italic>C. elegans</italic> linked proteins in the MKS and NPHP complexes to the formation of the Y-links in the transition zone (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).<disp-quote><p>“The axoneme above the transition zone was pretty much structurally normal.”</p></disp-quote></p>
    <p>Schouteden et al. probed the function of the protein that gives the CEP290 complex its name. The cilia of nematodes contain a version of this protein known as CCEP-290. Only a few sensory neurons in nematodes sport cilia, and the worms appear to get along fine without these cells, so researchers can manipulate the cilia without undermining the animals’ survival or reproduction.</p>
    <p>The team found that CCEP-290 is located in the middle of the transition zone, whereas proteins from the MKS and NPHP complexes are found at its edge. In mutant worms lacking CCEP-290, the Y-links were present but the central cylinder was fragmented, suggesting that the CEP290 complex helps assemble this latter structure.</p>
    <p>The researchers next asked what would happen if they disrupted all three transition zone complexes. They found that, in mutant worms, the transition zone structures largely collapsed. But the axoneme didn’t. “The axoneme above the transition zone was pretty much structurally normal,” says senior author Alexander Dammermann. Contrary to what researchers suspected, the transition zone isn’t essential for assembly of the axoneme.</p>
    <p>So what does the transition zone accomplish? One answer came from neurons whose dendrites carry cilia and extend through an unusual mechanism. Rather than stretching out, each dendrite anchors to the surface and lets the body of the cell crawl away from it. Schouteden et al. determined that cells lacking CCEP-290 or other transition zone proteins moved the same distance as normal cells, but their dendrites didn’t adhere.</p>
    <p>Those findings imply that cilia anchor dendrites to their substrate. The axoneme isn’t likely to make the connection, however. During worm development, dendrites extend before axoneme assembly is complete. Dendrites also latch on even if they lack a key protein from the basal body, suggesting that this structure isn’t directly involved in attachment either. Instead, the researchers’ results indicate that the transition zone gets a grip on the surface, linking to two proteins in the extracellular matrix: DEX-1 and DYF-7.</p>
    <p>“We say that in addition to their well-described roles in signaling and motility, there’s also a role for cilia in cell morphology by functioning in this adhesion process,” says Dammermann. Cilia might anchor cells in other situations, he and his colleagues suggest. For example, during development of the cerebral cortex in vertebrates, cilia might provide traction for certain neural precursors as they push away from an epithelial zone known as the apical adherens belt. The research opens up several questions about cilia assembly and function, including what the role of cilium-mediated anchoring is in ciliopathies and how the axoneme forms without the aid of the transition zone.</p>

        <p>Rpgrip1l regulates proteasomal activity at the basal body via Psmd2 and thereby controls ciliary signaling.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Mutations in <italic>RPGRIP1L</italic> result in severe human diseases called ciliopathies. To unravel the molecular function of RPGRIP1L, we analyzed <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse embryos, which display a ciliopathy phenotype and die, at the latest, around birth. In these embryos, cilia-mediated signaling was severely disturbed. Defects in Shh signaling suggested that the Rpgrip1l deficiency causes an impairment of protein degradation and protein processing. Indeed, we detected a cilia-dependent decreased proteasomal activity in the absence of Rpgrip1l. We found different proteasomal components localized to cilia and identified Psmd2, a component of the regulatory proteasomal 19S subunit, as an interaction partner for Rpgrip1l. Quantifications of proteasomal substrates demonstrated that Rpgrip1l regulates proteasomal activity specifically at the basal body. Our study suggests that Rpgrip1l controls ciliary signaling by regulating the activity of the ciliary proteasome via Psmd2.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Primary cilia act as antenna-like structures, transducing signals from the environment to control essential cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and differentiation. Cilia consist of three different compartments—the basal body (BB), the transition zone (TZ), and the axoneme. The BB is a modified centriole from which the ciliary microtubule-based framework, the axoneme, grows out. The intermediate region between the BB and the axoneme is called the TZ. Mutations in the gene <italic>RPGRIP1L</italic> lead to a broad spectrum of severe human diseases, which are based on cilia dysfunction commonly summarized as ciliopathies (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Arts et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Delous et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Wolf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Zaghloul and Katsanis, 2010</xref>). <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic> is an evolutionary conserved gene encoding a protein that is located at the base of cilia (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Arts et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Delous et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Vierkotten et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Gonzalo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Mahuzier et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse embryos display a ciliopathy phenotype with defects in numerous organs and die, at the latest, around birth (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Vierkotten et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Besse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gerhardt et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p>Protein degradation is an essential process to ensure proper cellular signaling and hence a normal development of an organism (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). In eukaryotes, ∼80–90% of all proteins are degraded by the 26S proteasome (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Lilienbaum, 2013</xref>), which functions as catalytic component of the ubiquitin–proteasome system that consists of 19S and 20S subunits. Proteins become phosphorylated as well as ubiquitinated and bind to the 19S regulatory complex. Subsequently, they are degraded by the multiple peptidase activities containing 20S subunit (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Coux et al., 1996</xref>). In addition to controlling protein degradation, the proteasome is able to cleave one or more peptide bonds of a target protein to modify its activity, an event known as proteolytic processing. As a result of its importance for the degradation or processing of proteins, the ubiquitin–proteasome system is involved in the regulation and proper functioning of numerous signaling pathways. For example, the proteasome is responsible for the degradation of β-Catenin, the mediator of canonical Wnt signaling, as well as for the processing of Gli3, an important component of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway. In case of Shh signaling, the presence of the ligand Shh induces the activation of Gli3-190 which then switches on the transcription of Shh target genes. In the absence of Shh, Gli3-190 is proteolytically processed to Gli3-83, the predominant repressor of Shh target gene transcription (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2000</xref>). Previously, different studies described an association between proteasomal degradation and ciliary proteins. For example, the loss of Bbs4, Bbs7, and Ofd1 results in a decreased proteasomal activity, respectively (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gerdes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gascue et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, proteasomal degradation is involved in ciliogenesis and the intraflagellar transport (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Zalli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kasahara et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
      <p>Interestingly, a link between primary cilia and the autophagy–lysosome system, another protein degradation mechanism, has been found (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Pampliega et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). Autophagy is characterized by the formation of autophagosomes, double-membrane vesicles. These autophagosomes enclose their targets and then fuse their external membrane with lysosomes to degrade their cargo. Targets of autophagy can be long-lived or aggregated proteins as well as intracellular pathogens and cellular organelles (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Farré et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kraft et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Orvedahl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Rott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Klionsky, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Thurston et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Lilienbaum, 2013</xref>). It was shown that ciliary signaling induces autophagy (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Pampliega et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p>Analyzing the molecular background of ciliopathies based on Rpgrip1l deficiency in this study, we uncovered that Rpgrip1l regulates proteasomal activity. However, it does not control total cellular proteasomal activity per se but exclusively at primary cilia. Our data reveal the localization of proteasomal components at the ciliary base and a decreased activity of the ciliary proteasome in the absence of Rpgrip1l. We show that Rpgrip1l interacts with Psmd2, a proteasomal 19S subunit component, at the ciliary TZ. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that Rpgrip1l realizes the regulation of proteasomal activity at the ciliary base via Psmd2.</p>

        <title>Rpgrip1l is located at the ciliary TZ in G<sub>0</sub> phase and at centrosomes during mitosis</title>
        <p>Originally, Rpgrip1l has been shown to be a BB protein (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Arts et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Delous et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Vierkotten et al., 2007</xref>). More recent reports describe a more detailed localization at the ciliary TZ (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Gonzalo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Mahuzier et al., 2012</xref>). We choose mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as in vitro system for analyzing Rpgrip1l function. In these primary cells, Rpgrip1l is located at the TZ during G<sub>0</sub> phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>) and at both centrosomes during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). In embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) limb cilia, Rpgrip1l is also present at the TZ and at centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). This means that in vivo studies of limbs, a well-known system for studying functional mechanisms, can be used to complement the data of MEFs.</p>

        <title>Rpgrip1l regulates proteasomal activity at the ciliary base</title>
        <p>The observations of significant elongation of cilia in our in vitro and in vivo model systems led us to the question if ciliary signaling is affected in these systems. Previously, we found an elevated Gli3-190/Gli3-83 ratio in <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse embryos as a result of a reduced proteolytic processing of Gli3 (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Vierkotten et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with this suspicion, the Gli3-190/Gli3-83 ratios are also elevated in <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs and isolated limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Because previous studies showed that the deficiency of other TZ proteins affects events upstream of Gli3 in the Shh signal cascade (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Gonzalo et al., 2011</xref>) and since Smo regulates Gli3 modification via the Evc–Evc2 complex (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Dorn et al., 2012</xref>), we analyzed the amount of Smo and Evc in cilia of SAG (Shh agonist)-treated <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs. We could not detect any alteration in the amount of either protein in cilia of <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201408060/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1, A and B</ext-link>) making it likely that Rpgrip1l affects Shh signaling at the level of Gli3. In search of the cause for the increased Gli3-190/Gli3-83 ratio, we investigated proteasomal activity. However, changes in overall cellular proteasomal activity were not detected in <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Because Gli3-processing is dependent on cilia (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Haycraft et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Besse et al., 2011</xref>), we could not exclude that proteasomal activity is reduced exclusively at cilia. Potentially, an alteration of proteasomal degradation specific at cilia is undetectable in measurements of general proteasomal substrates. To test this hypothesis, we measured the amount of phospho-(S33/37/T41)-β-Catenin, a well-known proteasomal substrate (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aberle et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hart et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kitagawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Latres et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Winston et al., 1999</xref>). A previous study showed a localization of phospho-(S33/37/T41)-β-Catenin at the ciliary base (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Corbit et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that this is the location of its degradation. In total lysates of serum-starved <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs (on average, 82% of all cells had cilia), the amount of phospho-(S33/37/T41)-β-Catenin is significantly increased in comparison to serum-starved WT MEFs (on average, 88.6% of all cells produced cilia; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>), whereas non–phospho-(S33/37/T41)-β-Catenin is unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). In total lysates of non–serum-starved <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs (on average, 4% of all cells possessed cilia), the amount of phospho-(S33/37/T41)-β-Catenin is not changed in comparison to non–serum-starved WT MEFs (on average, 6.67% of all cells had cilia; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>), demonstrating that the degradation of phospho-(S33/37/T41)-β-Catenin is cilia dependent. The amount of phospho-(S33/37/T41)-β-Catenin is significantly increased at the ciliary base of <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>).

        <p>If proteasomal degradation occurs at the ciliary base, ubiquitinated proteins should accumulate there. We used an antibody specifically recognizing an epitope of ubiquitin proteins and detected an accumulation at cilia of WT MEFs. In <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs, there are significantly more ubiquitinated proteins at the ciliary base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>) consistent with a decrease of proteasomal activity in the absence of Rpgrip1l. In line with these findings in our in vitro model, the amount of phospho-(S33/37/T41)-β-Catenin and Ubiquitin is also significantly elevated at the ciliary base of <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, G and H</xref>). Additionally, the ciliary amount of Gli3-190 is significantly elevated in <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 I</xref>). To test whether the elevation of the different proteins at cilia of <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs could be caused by a dysfunction of the proteasome, we treated WT MEFs with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Rock et al., 1994</xref>) and expected to provoke a situation comparable to the <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> state. After MG132 treatment, the amount of phospho-(S33/37/T41)-β-Catenin is significantly increased at the ciliary base of WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 J</xref>). Furthermore, MG132 treatment results in a significant elongation of MEF cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 K</xref>), mimicking the increased ciliary length of <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In a parallel approach, we tested whether a fluorescence reporter system could be used to evaluate whether the activity of the proteasome is decreased in the absence of Rpgrip1l. In general, these reporters are rapidly diffusing and do not accumulate at specific subcellular localizations. Therefore, they may not be ideal for measuring proteasomal activity at the ciliary base. However, differential proteasomal activity in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of MBECs and HepG2 cells using the Proteasome Sensor Vector has been previously reported (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>). This vector encodes the ZsProSensor-1 protein, a fusion of a GFP with a degradation domain, which targets the protein for rapid degradation by the proteasome. We transfected the Proteasome Sensor Vector into WT as well as <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs and detected the green fluorescence signal at 88.9% of all analyzed <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEF cilia (<italic>n</italic> = 16 out of 18 cilia) but never at WT cilia (<italic>n</italic> = 0 out of 37 cilia; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 L</xref>), demonstrating a diminished activity of the proteasome. Consequently, the amount of ZsProSensor-1 is significantly elevated at the ciliary base of <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 L</xref>). Interestingly, the accumulation of the green fluorescence signal in <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs was observed exclusively at cilia and not at centrosomes or other subcellular locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 L</xref>).</p>
        <p>Based on these observations, it appears that Rpgrip1l regulates proteasomal activity in a cilia-dependent manner. Because Rpgrip1l localizes to the ciliary TZ, it is possible that it controls proteasomal activity directly at primary cilia. To our knowledge, the existence of a ciliary proteasome (a proteasome that localizes and functions at cilia) has been assumed (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Wen et al., 2010</xref>) but not proven until now.</p>
        <p>A prerequisite for a proteasome to function at the base of cilia is the presence of components of the 19S and 20S proteasomal subunits. Psmd2, Psmd3, and Psmd4, which are components of the 19S proteasomal subunit, are found at the BB of WT MEF cilia by using 3D-SIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A–C</xref>), supporting the assumed existence of a ciliary proteasome. Psma5, which is a component of the 20S proteasomal subunit is detected at the ciliary base (BB as well as TZ) and along the axoneme of WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, D and E</xref>), indicating a transport of Psma5 through the cilium. Assuming a transport of Psma5 along the cilium, we propose the BB as the location were the ciliary proteasome localizes and functions. This is the most likely scenario because we never detected components of the 19S proteasomal subunit along the axoneme of MEF cilia.</p>

        <p>Proteasomes have been detected in the nucleus, in the microsomes, in the cytosol, at the centrosomes and at the base of cilia (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Wigley et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brooks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gerdes et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, both Rpgrip1l and Psmd2, are located at centrosomes during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). Because the mother centriole functions as ciliary BB, this finding indicates that their interaction might occur at the ciliary base. Immunofluorescence on ciliated MEFs reveals a partial overlap of Rpgrip1l and Psmd2 staining at the TZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>), indicating that Psmd2 localizes mainly at the BB but also partially at the TZ. This identifies the TZ as a potential Rpgrip1l–Psmd2 interaction site. To further investigate this question, we used a technique called in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) in which an interaction is detected via a fluorescence signal (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Söderberg et al., 2006</xref>). We tested its applicability for this approach by investigating the already known interaction of Rpgrip1l with Nphp4 in the TZ. In this assay, a PLA signal can be observed at the TZ of WT MEF cilia in 100% of the cases, whereas we did not detect a PLA signal at <italic>Rpgrip1l<sup>−/−</sup></italic> MEF cilia (Fig. S1 D). Analyzing the interaction of Rpgrip1l with Psmd2, the PLA signal is always present at the TZ of WT MEF cilia, but we never detected a PLA signal at <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref>), indicating that Rpgrip1l and Psmd2 interact at the ciliary TZ of MEFs. Although Rpgrip1l and Psmd2 are observed at the centrosomes in the course of mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>), we detected the Rpgrip1l/Psmd2 PLA signal exclusively in the presence of cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref>) but not at centrosomes (Fig. S1 F). These findings suggest that Rpgrip1l regulates the activity of a cilia-specific proteasome directly at the TZ of primary cilia and that this regulation may be realized via Psmd2.</p>
        <p>Because in MEFs, the interaction of Rpgrip1l and Psmd2 seems to take place only at the ciliary TZ, but Rpgrip1l is also located at centrosomes during mitosis, the question arises whether Rpgrip1l also regulates the activity of the centrosomal proteasome. Proteasomal degradation at the centrosome has previously been reported for ubiquitinated proteins (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fabunmi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Puram et al., 2013</xref>). Using MG132, an inhibitor of proteasomal activity, we were able to show that the centrosomal (pericentriolar) proteasome is also responsible for the degradation of phospho-(S33/37/T41)-β-Catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). In contrast to the situation at the ciliary base, the amount of phospho-(S33/37/T41)-β-Catenin and ubiquitinated proteins is unaltered at the centrosomes of <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, B and C</xref>). These results correspond to the finding that the green fluorescence signal of the Proteasome Sensor Vector exclusively accumulates at the ciliary base in the absence of Rpgrip1l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 L</xref>), indicating that Rpgrip1l only affects the activity of the ciliary proteasome in MEFs. Consequently, our data reveal a regulation of proteasomal activity by Rpgrip1l exclusively at primary cilia and most likely via the interaction with Psmd2. To evaluate whether Rpgrip1l deficiency affects the activity of the 26S proteasome by affecting the function of the 19S proteasomal subunit, the amount of ubiquitinated proteins was determined at the ciliary base of MEFs in which several components of the 19S proteasomal subunit (Psmd2, Psmd3, or Psmd4) were knocked down. In MEFs, Psmd2, Psmd3, and Psmd4 knockdowns result in a significantly higher amount of ubiquitinated proteins at the ciliary base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, A, B, D, and F</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201408060/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S2, A and B</ext-link>), mimicking the <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> status. This result suggests that Rpgrip1l regulates the activity of the ciliary proteasome by affecting the 19S proteasomal subunit. Remarkably, knockdowns of all these 19S proteasomal subunit components lead to significant ciliary elongation in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, C, E, and G</xref>). Considering that Rpgrip1l interacts with Psmd2 by means of its RID domain, we tested whether Rpgrip1l overexpression increases the activity of the ciliary proteasome by transfecting the RID domain of Rpgrip1l into NIH3T3 cells as well as into WT MEFs. We quantified the amount of Ubiquitin at the ciliary base as well as ciliary length. The amount of Ubiquitin was significantly decreased at the ciliary base of RID-transfected NIH3T3 cells and WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10, A and C</xref>), indicating that the ciliary proteasome is regulated by Rpgrip1l via its interaction with Psmd2 at the ciliary TZ. Interestingly, cilia were significantly longer after RID transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10, B and D</xref>). To exclude that these effects are caused by an overexpression of any type of protein, we also transfected a control protein (Wnk2) into NIH3T3 cells and detected no alteration in Ubiquitin amount or cilia length (Fig. S2, C and D). Because the transfection of the RID domain leads to an increased activity of the ciliary proteasome, we also transfected the RID domain into <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs to elevate the activity of the ciliary proteasome. Indeed, the ciliary amount of Ubiquitin was restored in these MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 C</xref>). However, ciliary length of <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs was unaltered after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 D</xref>), implying that the RID domain of Rpgrip1l is essential for the regulation of the ciliary proteasome but is dispensable for the regulation of cilia length. Consequently, another part of the Rpgrip1l protein is needed to control the length of cilia.</p>

        <p>Because Psmd2 is a 19S proteasomal subunit, and hence, Rpgrip1l may have only a direct regulatory impact on the 19S subunit, it could be possible that a drug-induced activation of the 20S proteasomal subunit leads to an increase of proteasomal activity in <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs. We treated WT and <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs with sulforaphane (SFN), which activates the catalytic proteasomal 20S subunit (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kwak et al., 2007</xref>) and detected a reduction of proteasomal substrates at the ciliary base to a WT level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10, E and F</xref>), indicating that SFN treatment rescues the activity of the ciliary proteasome in <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs.</p>
        <p>However, ciliary length is not recovered in <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs after SFN treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 G</xref>). Interestingly, like MG132 treatment, SFN treatment leads to a significant elongation of WT cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 G</xref>). To exclude that the findings of the SFN treatment experiments are only phenomenona in cell culture, we performed the treatment in ex vivo–cultured mouse embryos. In this experiment, the activity of the ciliary proteasome is also rescued by SFN treatment, because the Ubiquitin amount at the ciliary base in <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> embryos decreased to WT level after SFN treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 H</xref>).

      <p>Mutations in the gene <italic>RPGRIP1L</italic> result in various ciliopathies in humans (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Zaghloul and Katsanis, 2010</xref>), accentuating it as a proper candidate gene to examine the underlying molecular dysfunction. Using the mouse as a model, we show that the absence of Rpgrip1l leads to an impairment of the ciliary proteasome, which is located at the BB of cilia. Because proteasomal function is essential for proper development and function of multiple organs (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Rubinsztein, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Breusing et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Robbins, 2014</xref>), our findings broach the issue of disturbed protein degradation as a cause of ciliopathies.</p>
      <p>In the <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> state, we detected a decrease of proteasomal activity at the ciliary base in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>) but not at the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, B and C</xref>), indicating that the regulation of the proteasome via Rpgrip1l is cilia dependent. It might be that the ciliary and the centrosomal proteasome are one and the same. But, we are able to demonstrate that Rpgrip1l regulates exclusively the activity of the ciliary proteasome.</p>
      <p>Recently, it was shown that the ciliopathy-associated proteins Bbs4 and Ofd1 are essential for the proteasomal degradation or processing of proteins involved in paracrine signaling (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Our study confirms the discovery of ciliary base proteins as regulators of proteasomal activity and hence cilia-mediated signaling. Additionally, our data complete these findings by revealing that the ciliopathy-associated protein Rpgrip1l does not control proteasomal activity in general but specifically the activity of the ciliary proteasome. Alternatively, it was reported that the TZ protein Nphp4 affects the ubiquitin conjugation system via its interaction with Jade-1, a novel ubiquitin ligase (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Borgal et al., 2012</xref>). This may indicate that the elevated amounts of proteins, which we detect at the ciliary base, could also result from defective ubiquitination. But, in contrast to this possibility, we detected an accumulation of ubiquitin at the ciliary base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, F and H</xref>), arguing for a proteasomal defect rather than for a ubiquitination defect. Additionally, this result also speaks against a phosphorylation defect and indicates that the elevated amount of phospho-(S33/37/T41)-β-Catenin results from impaired proteasomal activity. Thus, although Rpgrip1l and Nphp4 interact with each other (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Arts et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Delous et al., 2007</xref>) and function in the same TZ module (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Czarnecki and Shah, 2012</xref>), the impact of these two proteins on protein degradation is different. Although Nphp4 has an effect on the labeling of proteins destined to become degraded by the proteasome, Rpgrip1l affects the activity of the ciliary proteasome most likely by interacting with the proteasomal 19S subunit component Psmd2 at the ciliary TZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). It was shown before that Psmd2 is able to regulate proteasomal activity (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Matsuyama et al., 2011</xref>). We confirmed this finding in WT MEFs by using RNAi because knockdown of Psmd2 results in a significantly decreased proteasomal activity at the ciliary base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, A and B</xref>). Remarkably, the presence of Psmd2 at the ciliary base does not depend on Rpgrip1l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>), indicating that Rpgrip1l controls the activity of the ciliary proteasome not by anchoring Psmd2 to cilia. This is a major difference to the regulation of proteasomal activity by Bbs4 and Ofd1. Though Bbs4 and Ofd1 also interact with proteasomal components, Bbs4 and Ofd1 deficiency leads to a decreased amount of these proteasomal components (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, Bbs4 and Ofd1 are essential for the composition of the proteasome. Moreover, Bbs4 and Ofd1 are thought to control proteasomal activity within the whole cell (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), whereas Rpgrip1l is the first protein for which it is demonstrated that it specifically and exclusively regulates the activity of the proteasome at the ciliary base.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Bbs4 recruitment is disturbed in autophagy-deficient cells (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). Consequently, if the ciliary localization of Bbs4 is essential for proper proteasomal activity, it is possible that impaired autophagy leads to a reduced proteasomal activity. In contrast, Ofd1 is degraded by autophagy (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). Because it is unknown whether an elevated amount of Ofd1 results in an increased proteasomal activity, it is difficult to evaluate if disturbed autophagy really provokes a reduced proteasomal activity. Until now, an association between autophagy and Rpgrip1l has not been described, but studying this potential connection would help to unravel the relationship between cilia, proteasome, and autophagy.</p>
      <p>A potential association of Rpgrip1l with proteasomal activity has been found before. <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Mahuzier et al. (2012)</xref> showed that <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic> knockdown results in a reduction of Dsh at the ciliary base in MDCK cells. Because Dsh is degraded by the proteasome, these data imply a negative regulation of the ciliary proteasome by Rpgrip1l in MDCK cells and hence the opposite of our results. Previous data and our cilia length measurements implicate that Rpgrip1l deficiency affects cilium biogenesis and stability depending on the cell type. For example, cilia are absent in the node and the neural tube (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Vierkotten et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Besse et al., 2011</xref>), shorter in the heart and the cochlea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Mahuzier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gerhardt et al., 2013</xref>) and longer in the limbs, the lung, the liver, and in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the differences in the study by <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Mahuzier et al. (2012)</xref> and the work presented here reflect differences in the molecular mechanisms between cilia of MEFs and MDCK cells. The phenomenon that the absence of Rpgrip1l leads to longer cilia in some organs and to shorter cilia in other organs is difficult to explain, because it is not known whether the composition of the ciliary proteome is different across organs. It was shown before that loss of one single protein (Mks1 and Tctn1, respectively) leads to ciliary shape defects in some organs, but not in all (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Weatherbee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Gonzalo et al., 2011</xref>), indicating the existence of organ-specific cilia formation mechanisms.</p>
      <p>According to our data, a decreased activity of the ciliary proteasome is a potential cause of ciliopathies. Thus, it will be indispensable to uncover the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the ciliary proteasome by Rpgrip1l. The outcome of these future studies could be the prerequisite for new therapies to treat ciliopathies. In this context, treatment of <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs and limbs (ex vivo embryo culture) with SFN seems to result in a nearly restored activity of the ciliary proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10, E, F, and H</xref>), suggesting that enhancement of the proteasomal 20S subunit activity rescues proteasomal function even in the absence of Rpgrip1l. It was shown previously that SFN treatment of different cells increases the expression of 20S proteasomal subunit components (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kwak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ramirez and Singletary, 2009</xref>) and that SFN realizes this effect by activating Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2) signaling (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kwak et al., 2003</xref>), a signaling pathway known to promote transcriptional antioxidant response (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Rushmore et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Itoh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Because we found a higher amount of Psma5, a component of the 20S proteasomal subunit, in cilia of <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs, why up-regulating the expression of 20S proteasomal subunits via application of SFN is able to compensate the reduced proteasomal activity in <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells remains an open and difficult question. Possibly, SFN is able to affect the activity of the ciliary proteasome via another, yet unknown way. Consequently, future studies will be necessary to understand the effect of SFN on proteasomal activity in the absence of Rpgrip1l.</p>
      <p>Formerly, an association between proteasomal degradation and the intraflagellar transport was suggested (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2011</xref>), making it likely that proteasomal function regulates ciliary length. Interestingly, cilia of WT MEFs are significantly longer after MG132 and SFN treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 G</xref>) and also ciliary length of WT limbs is significantly elevated after SFN treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 I</xref>), meaning that proteasomal activation and inhibition increases ciliary length. But although the activity of the ciliary proteasome is almost normalized in SFN-treated <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs and limbs, their cilia are not shorter after SFN treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10, G and I</xref>), indicating that another factor is responsible for the ciliary elongation in the absence of Rpgrip1l.</p>
      <p>It was reported in a previous study that proteasomal dysfunction is only one contributor to the pathology of ciliopathies (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Our data confirm this perception, because increased ciliary length is not (only) caused by reduced proteasomal activity in the absence of Rpgrip1l. But nevertheless in the case of some organs (e.g., the forebrain), the severe defects caused by Rpgrip1l deficiency are based on the impairment of proteasomal activity (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Besse et al., 2011</xref>). The consequences of proteasomal dysfunction for different paracrine signaling pathways have been shown recently (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Because mutations in <italic>RPGRIP1L</italic> result in many different severe human ciliopathies (<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Zaghloul and Katsanis, 2010</xref>), our analyses make an important contribution to how ciliary proteins control proteasomal activity. To our knowledge, it was never shown before that a ciliary protein regulates specifically and exclusively the ciliary proteasome and that this regulation is realized by an interaction with a proteasomal component in a qualitative rather than in a quantitative level. The interaction of Rpgrip1l with the 19S proteasomal subunit component Psmd2 indicates that Rpgrip1l controls the activity of the ciliary proteasome by regulating the activity of the 19S proteasomal subunit. Consequently, knockdowns of different components of the 19S proteasomal subunit result in a decreased activity of the ciliary proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, A, B, D, and F</xref>; and Fig. S2, A and B), resembling the <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Rpgrip1l does not ensure the accurate localization of Psmd2 to the ciliary base but regulates the activity of the ciliary proteasome most likely via its interaction with Psmd2. How Rpgrip1l affects Psmd2 function in detail, e.g., via triggering a conformational alteration, has to be elucidated in the future and will give novel mechanistical insights into the molecular background underlying severe human ciliopathies.</p>

        <p>The in situ PLA (PLA or DUOLINK) was performed according to the manufacturer’s manual (OLink Bioscience) and was used to detect the subcellular localization of the interaction between Rpgrip1l and Psmd2. First, Rpgrip1l and Psmd2 are recognized by specific primary antibodies. Subsequently, PLA probes consisting of species-specific secondary antibodies, each with a unique short DNA strand attached to it, bind to the primary antibodies. The addition of two other circle-forming DNA oligonucleotides leads to an interaction of the DNA strands if Rpgrip1l and Psmd2 are in close proximity (&lt;40 nm). After joining of the two added oligonucleotides by enzymatic ligation, a rolling circle amplification using a polymerase starts. The amplified DNA is visualized by fluorescent-labeled complementary oligonucleotide probes. The cilium in the in situ PLA experiments was marked by the product of a transiently transfected IFT88-EYFP construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 E</xref> and Fig. S1 D), which was a gift provided by D.R.

After addition of lysis buffer (250 mM sucrose, 25 mM Hepes, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM EDTA, and 1.7 mM DTT), cells were lysed as a result of repeated freeze–thaw cycles. To differentiate between 20S proteasome activity (ATP independent) and 26S proteasome activity (ATP dependent), an assay in the presence of ATP and one with depleted ATP were performed simultaneously. ATP was depleted using 0.1 mg/ml hexokinase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 15 mM 2-deoxyglucose (Sigma-Aldrich). In the parallel incubation, ATP (Sigma-Aldrich) was added with a 2 mM final concentration. Afterward, cell lysates were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with 225 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.8, containing 45 mM potassium chloride, 7.5 mM magnesium acetate, 7.5 mM magnesium chloride, and 1 mM DTT and the fluorogenic peptide suc-LLVY-MCA (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; Sigma-Aldrich). The fluorogenic peptide is degraded by the chymotrypsin-like protease of the proteasome into the degradation product MCA (Sigma-Aldrich). The MCA liberation measurement was performed with 360-nm excitation and 460-nm emission. As a standard for quantification, free MCA in different concentrations was used.

        <p>Intensity of ciliary protein staining was quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).

For ciliary base protein intensities, we selected the region labeled by γ-tubulin and the area in-between the γ-tubulin staining and the proximal part of the acetylated α-tubulin staining (for TZ proteins) and measured the total pixel intensity. In the case of the Psmd2 knockdown experiment, γ-tubulin was not used, but a triple staining with antibodies to acetylated α-tubulin, Psmd2, and Ubiquitin was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref>). To measure the amounts of Psmd2 and Ubiquitin, we determined the greatest distance of γ-tubulin to the proximal part of acetylated α-tubulin in all quantifications we performed by using γ-tubulin and acetylated α-tubulin. This was 1.5 µm. Afterward, we used a square of 1.5 × 1.5 µm to quantify the amount of Ubiquitin and Psmd2 at the ciliary base. To get rid of the ratio of unspecific (background) staining, we subtracted the mean value of the average pixel intensity (in the case of axoneme-associated proteins) or of the total pixel intensity (for all BB or TZ proteins) of three neighboring regions free from specific staining.</p>

        <title>Proteasome activity assay at the ciliary base</title>
        <p>The activity of the ciliary proteasome was evaluated using WT and <italic>Rpgrip1l<sup>−/−</sup></italic> MEFs transiently transfected with the Proteasome Sensor Vector (Takara Bio Inc.). This vector encodes the so-called ZsProSensor-1 protein, a fusion of a bright GFP with a degradation domain that targets the protein for rapid degradation by the proteasome. If the green fluorescence accumulates, proteasomal activity is decreased. If there is no accumulation of green fluorescence, the proteasome is functioning normally.</p>
        <p>An accumulation of the ZsProSensor-1 protein was observed exclusively at the ciliary base of <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 L</xref>), although fluorescence proteasome reporter proteins are usually rapidly diffusing. Potentially, it accumulates in this way because the ZsProSensor-1 is a specific degradation motif of ornithine decarboxylase that has been fused to the fluorescent ZsGreen protein. This fusion protein is degraded by the proteasome without requiring prior ubiquitination. Hence, a trapping of polyubiquitinated proteins by, for example, receptors localized at the ciliary base cannot be an explanation for the accumulation of the ZsProSensor-1 at the base of <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cilia. Ornithine decarboxylase has been shown to be proteasomally degraded with the help of its interaction with AZ1 (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). In turn, AZ1 interacts with Aurora A and is essential for Aurora A degradation by the proteasome (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lim and Gopalan, 2007</xref>). Interestingly, Aurora A localizes to the ciliary BB (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Pugacheva et al., 2007</xref>) and potentially is degraded by the ciliary proteasome. Maybe at least partially, ornithine decarboxylase is also degraded by the ciliary proteasome and caused by the reduced activity of the ciliary proteasome in the absence of Rpgrip1l, the ZsProSensor-1 protein accumulates at the cilium. The proteasome activity assay at the ciliary base was repeated once.</p>

Fig. S4 illustrates antibody specificity in wide-field views (anti-Cep290, anti-Rpgrip1l, anti–p-β-Catenin, anti-Ubiquitin, and anti–Gli3-190 antibodies), by using <italic>Nphp4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs and by using antigens against Smo and Evc. Fig. S5 depicts antibody specificity in wide-field views (anti-Psmd2, anti-Psmd3, anti-Psma5, and anti-Psmd4 antibodies) and by using antigens against Psmd2, Psmd3, Psma5, and Psmd4.

        <p>When nerve injury occurs, the axon and myelin fragments distal to the injury site have to be cleared away before repair. In this issue, Gomez-Sanchez et al. (2015; <italic>J. Cell Biol</italic>. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201503019">http://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201503019</ext-link>) find that clearance of the damaged myelin within Schwann cells occurs not by phagocytosis but rather via selective autophagy, in a process they term “myelinophagy.”</p>

  <body>
    <p>The peripheral nervous system has the considerable ability to regenerate axons after nerve injury. A prerequisite for successful repair is the degradation and clearance of axonal and myelin fragments in areas distal to the injury site, a process known as Wallerian degeneration (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Vargas and Barres, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Conforti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Simons et al., 2014</xref>). In nerves undergoing Wallerian degeneration, myelin breaks down and fragments into small ovoid-like structures at the Schmidt-Lanterman clefts (funnel-shaped incisures in the myelin). These fragmented pieces of damaged myelin were thought to be cleared away by phagocytosis both by Schwann cells and by invading macrophages.</p>
    <p>However, in this issue, <related-article id="d35e143" related-article-type="commentary-article" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1083/jcb.201503019">Gomez-Sanchez et al.</related-article> now show that macroautophagy is essential for myelin breakdown and clearance in Schwann cells after nerve injury. Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a bulk degradation pathway that delivers cytoplasmic substrates to lysosomes for degradation (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2014</xref>). During this process, cytoplasm and superfluous or dysfunctional organelles are sequestered by the phagophore, a double membrane that expands and matures into an autophagosome. Autophagosomes subsequently fuse with lysosomes, which trigger degradation of the autophagic cargo by hydrolases.</p>
    <p>Autophagy was initially described as a nonselective process that occurs in response to starvation or during cell differentiation, but it is now clear that there are tightly regulated and highly selective subtypes that require cargo recognition by the autophagy machinery. Several cargo-specific autophagic subtypes have been described: for example, the removal of aggregated proteins (aggrephagy), damaged mitochondria (mitophagy), peroxisomes (pexophagy), ribosomes (ribophagy), endoplasmic reticulum (reticulophagy), lipid droplets (lipophagy), and pathogens (xenophagy; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Okamoto, 2014</xref>). Now, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Gomez-Sanchez et al. (2015)</xref> show that in response to nerve injury, autophagy is responsible for clearing away damaged myelin within Schwann cells, a process that they term “myelinophagy.” These findings are particular remarkable, as myelinophagy, in contrast to other cargo-selective variants of macroautophagy that degrade damaged intracellular components, describes a process of how a plasma membrane is degraded.</p>
    <p>To solve this topological conundrum, a closer look at myelin architecture is necessary. Myelin is formed when the “inner tongue,” the leading edge of the myelinating cells, starts to move multiple times around the axon until a multilayered compacted membrane is generated (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bunge et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Snaidero et al., 2014</xref>). When the process is completed, the Schwann cell engulfs the myelin sheath with its outermost, cytoplasmic-rich myelin layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Even if myelin is localized within the interior of the Schwann cell, it is continuous with the plasma membrane and therefore not an intracellular structure. However, in nerves undergoing Wallerian degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), myelin starts to fragment into ovoid-like structures in an active process that requires actin polymerization at the Schmidt-Lanterman incisures (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2011</xref>). During this process, myelin loses its connection with the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). If, now, the outermost layer of the myelin membrane fuses with the plasma membrane—like the closure of a phagocytic cup—fragmented myelin would be internalized into the Schwann cell cytoplasm without using endocytic pathways. Here, the myelin fragments could be selectively recognized by so-far unknown autophagic receptor molecules for the recruitment to the phagophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Why do Schwann cells use autophagy and not endocytosis for recycling parts of its plasma membrane? One reason could be that fragmented myelin sheaths are too tightly clumped and too bulky for Schwann cells that are not specialized in phagocytosis.</p>

(C) The Schwann cell then internalizes myelin fragments, possibly by the fusion of the outer “lips” of the Schwann cell plasma membrane. (D) Next, the resulting myelin fragments are taken up into phagophores. Not shown is the following: the sealing of phagophores to form autophagosomes and their fusion with lysosomes, which finally leads to degradation of the myelin fragments.</p>

    <p>Based on the presented model of myelinophagy, a block of autophagy should result in the accumulation of fragmented myelin within the Schwann cell cytoplasm. Surprisingly, this is not what <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Gomez-Sanchez et al. (2015)</xref> observe; instead, they find intact myelin sheaths after blocking autophagy genetically or pharmacologically. Thus, autophagy must somehow participate in myelin fragmentation. One possibility is that autophagy activates or provides energy for pathways involved in myelin fragmentation. Alternatively, autophagy is required for triggering an intrinsic genetic program in Schwann cells during nerve injury.</p>
    <p>Regardless of the mechanisms of myelin fragmentation and internalization, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Gomez-Sanchez et al. (2015)</xref> describe an important pathway of myelin breakdown in nerve injury. While this pathway is shown in the context of Wallerian degeneration, it is possible that myelinophagy is also activated in hereditary Charcot-Marie-Tooth or inflammatory neuropathies. One important question there is how axonal injury induces myelinophagy. It is known that Schwann cells are able to sense axon damage and respond by activating multiple signaling pathways, including ERK/MAPK, JNK/c-Jun, Notch, and JAK-STAT (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Harrisingh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Napoli et al., 2012</xref>). These signals not only induce cell activation, but also trigger myelin fragmentation. Myelinophagy is positively regulated by the JNK/c-Jun pathway, the central regulator of Schwann cell reprogramming during injury (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it appears that myelinophagy is part of a genetically controlled response that is triggered upon nerve dissection and coordinates the mutual breakdown of the connected axon–glia unit.</p>
    <p>What is the advantage of myelinophagy in Schwann cells as compared with myelin phagocytosis by invading macrophages? If Schwann cells are able to take care of a large part of myelin degradation with only a little help from macrophages, tissue inflammation could be kept to a minimum. In summary, myelinophagy represents a mechanism of how Schwann cells digest their own cell surface upon receiving signals from the associated and degenerating axon. This response must now be considered as an essential pathway of nerve injury in peripheral nerves. If myelinophagy is selective, identification of the cargo receptor will be an important step toward therapeutically modulating myelin turnover.</p>

  <body>
    <p>As an undergraduate student, my answer to the question “what is cell biology?” was fairly textbook. Cell biology is the study of the structure and function of the unit or units of living organisms. Intrinsic to the question of what is cell biology today is the more fun and engaging question: what are the open challenges for cell biologists, particularly regarding the emergence of fields such as microbiome studies. Here I outline one open challenge: deciphering the complex interactions between commensal microbiomes and host tissue.</p>
    <p>While I was in college, I would have said the most exciting questions in cell biology focused on organelle biogenesis and that the ultimate challenge for cell biology was to assemble a nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, or endolysosome in a test tube. The shine hasn’t faded from these questions for me, but graduate school provided me with a reality check into the complexity of such undertakings.</p>
    <p>Yale’s Cell Biology and Immunobiology departments, and the faculty there that mentored me—Ira Mellman, Jorge Galan, Peter Cresswell, and Norma Andrews, whose expertise spans cell biology, immunology, and host–pathogen interactions—influenced the questions that fascinated me during graduate school and beyond. As a graduate student in the Mellman laboratory, I studied macropinocytosis and how dendritic cells developmentally regulate this form of endocytosis to control antigen uptake. Findings from Alan Hall’s laboratory that Rho GTPases regulate cell migration, morphogenesis, and polarity (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Caron and Hall, 1998</xref>) and from Jorge Galan’s laboratory that <italic>Salmonella</italic> type III effectors regulate host Rho GTPases for invasion of the intestinal epithelium (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Hardt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Fu and Galán, 1999</xref>) suggested that <italic>Salmonella</italic> might shed light on how dendritic cells control their own membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis. With Ira and Jorge’s mentorship and the use of <italic>Salmonella</italic> mutants and microinjection, we gained some insights into how dendritic cells use the Rho GTPase, Cdc42, to developmentally regulate endocytosis (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Garrett et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
    <p>These salmonella experiments were the start of my interest in transkingdom relationships. Bacteria have taught and continue to teach me about cell biology and immunology. For my postdoctoral work, I had the privilege to train with Laurie Glimcher, whose laboratory has made seminal discoveries in the molecular pathways that regulate CD4 T helper cell development and activation as well as the molecular pathogenesis of osteoporosis. I came to her laboratory to deepen my knowledge of immunology and mouse models. Her scientific fearlessness and incisive intellect nurtured my developing interests in the gut microbiota. I was fortunate to receive additional mentorship from two microbiota innovators and experts, Jeffrey I. Gordon and Andy Onderdonk, during my postdoc years. The fields that I studied as a graduate student and postdoc and the expertise of my mentors spanned cell biology, biochemistry, host–pathogen interaction, microbiome studies, cancer biology, and immunology. These exposures and broad training are reflected in the wide range of scientific questions that my laboratory tries to study. The questions that stoked my interest in cell biology (e.g., how organelles assemble and maintain their size and shape) are quite similar to the questions that sparked my interest in the gut microbiota: e.g., how does a gut microbiome assemble; what factors shape its size, composition, and organization; and how does it change in response to a perturbations like food, antibiotics, immunotherapy, infections, or aging of its host? The gut microbiota is in many respects a multicellular network and has even been referred to as a “forgotten organ.” Bacteria, archaea, and fungi are all cells, but is the study of the microbiota cell biology? For me this raises the question of when cell biology emerged as a discipline.</p>
    <p>Susumu Ito, professor emeritus at Harvard Medical School, who has had a career in cell biology that has spanned more than six decades, told me that in the 1970s, departments of cell biology were born from departments of anatomy and physiology. Just as cell biology emerged from these fields, it is continuing to change with the times. More recently, systems biology departments have emerged and often are enriched with cell biologists. Synthetic biology appears to be the next wave that is sweeping up many cell biologists. These shifts in cell biology mirror the many complementary conceptualizations of the microbiota—a tunable, engineered circuit or network, a compartmentalized cell, and an organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

    <p>Given a definition of cell biology as the study of the structure and function of the unit or units of living organisms, perhaps those among us engaged in microbiome studies may find an academic home of our own within cell biology. Microbes are cells that are part of many multicellular organisms and are important for optimal organismal function. Cell biology via microscopy has brought and continues to afford a nuanced understanding of cellular processes in real time. I have similar hopes for microscopy and the gut microbiota. Fluorescence microscopy–based approaches using probes that detect microbial community members via specific regions of their DNA have been useful tools to visualize bacterial and fungal communities at surfaces, as have electron microscopy–based methods. Flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, which, for me, are close cousins of microscopy, are increasingly being used to “visualize” bacterial community membership, especially in conjunction with downstream techniques from single cell sequencing to defining transcriptional activity. There remain ample opportunities for innovation in bringing cell biology methods and approaches inclusive of microscopy to microbiome studies.</p>
    <p>There are ever-present homeostatic challenges to cells or multicellular organisms at environmental boundaries. Liminal spaces like body surfaces (skin, oropharynx, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts) are boundaries between host and microbe and are therefore particularly appealing from a cell biology perspective, and ripe for microbiome studies. In many animals, such surfaces are composed of polarized cells. The biology that supports the apical and basolateral architecture of intestinal epithelial cells encompasses the cell biological disciplines of vesicular trafficking, membrane transport, cytoskeletal systems, and cell–cell communication. That a polarized intestinal epithelium and its mucus layer enable the coexistence of billions of bacteria and millions of innate and adaptive immune cells within a distance of &lt;0.1 mm remains mesmerizing to me.</p>
    <p>There are many cell biology opportunities in defining these boundary spaces. For example, there are many unknowns in the assembly and maintenance of the intestinal mucus layer and the canonical and noncanonical roles of goblet cells, the mucus-producing cells of the intestine. From the microbial perspective, the influence of microbial products, both structural components and metabolites, on the function of epithelial and nonepithelial cells is an active area of microbiome studies with ample opportunities for cell biologists. My laboratory has interests in microbial metabolites that influence innate and adaptive immune function as well host molecules (metabolites and hormones) that affect bacterial cell function. There are also significant gaps in our understanding of how bacterial consortia assemble on body surfaces like the intestinal mucosa into so-called biofilms and the nature of host–microbe and microbe–microbe interactions in these spaces. These systems are rich areas for investigation by cell biologists that enjoy studying cell–cell interactions. Equally exciting are single cell biology questions, speculating how microbes may have influenced the architecture of cells beyond the mitochondrial endosymbiotic theory. Such questions may lead one to wax philosophical, but these are exciting challenges to tease apart given coevolution and coadaptation across the kingdoms of life. Whether one’s research focus rests within the interior of a cell or comes from the outside of cells looking in, it is all cell biology.</p>

        <p>CENP-C promotes kinetochore targeting of other constitutive centromere–associated network (CCAN) subunits by directly interacting with the four-subunit CCAN subcomplex CENP-HIKM and spatially organizing the localization of all other CCAN subunits downstream of CENP-A.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Kinetochores are multisubunit complexes that assemble on centromeres to bind spindle microtubules and promote faithful chromosome segregation during cell division. A 16-subunit complex named the constitutive centromere–associated network (CCAN) creates the centromere–kinetochore interface. CENP-C, a CCAN subunit, is crucial for kinetochore assembly because it links centromeres with the microtubule-binding interface of kinetochores. The role of CENP-C in CCAN organization, on the other hand, had been incompletely understood. In this paper, we combined biochemical reconstitution and cellular investigations to unveil how CENP-C promotes kinetochore targeting of other CCAN subunits. The so-called PEST domain in the N-terminal half of CENP-C interacted directly with the four-subunit CCAN subcomplex CENP-HIKM. We identified crucial determinants of this interaction whose mutation prevented kinetochore localization of CENP-HIKM and of CENP-TW, another CCAN subcomplex. When considered together with previous observations, our data point to CENP-C as a blueprint for kinetochore assembly.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Accurate and timely chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis is essential for cellular and organismal viability. During mitosis, sister chromatids generated upon DNA replication retain cohesion until they are bioriented on the mitotic spindle. Release of sister chromatid cohesion at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition allows the spindle to separate the sister chromatids into two genetically identical daughter cells (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cheerambathur and Desai, 2014</xref>).</p>
      <p>Kinetochores mediate the attachment of sister chromatids to spindle microtubules. These large structures, consisting of several copies of ∼30 core subunits, become established on a segment of specialized chromatin named the centromere, whose main hallmark is the presence of the histone H3 variant CENP-A (or CenH3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">McAinsh and Meraldi, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Fukagawa and Earnshaw, 2014</xref>). At low resolution, kinetochores appear as laminar structures, with an outer plate receiving the ends of spindle microtubules, and an inner plate adjacent to dense centromeric chromatin (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Santaguida and Musacchio, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cheeseman, 2014</xref>). The outer kinetochore plate hosts the KMN (Knl1 complex, Mis12 complex, Ndc80 complex) network, a 10-subunit assembly that plays a crucial role as a receptor for microtubules (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cheeseman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">DeLuca et al., 2006</xref>). The inner kinetochore hosts the constitutive centromere–associated network (CCAN), a complex of at least 16 different CENPs (centromeric proteins), several of which were originally identified in the CENP-A interactome of vertebrates (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">McCleland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Obuse et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Foltz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Izuta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Okada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hori et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

          <p><bold>Depletion of CENP-C abolishes localization of CCAN to kinetochores.</bold> (A) Schematic kinetochore organization. CCAN subunits are shown in hot pink. Light pink lines indicate presumed contacts with centromeric chromatin. Black arrows indicate direct and well-established interactions. Gray arrows represent interactions that are still uncharacterized and that were characterized in this study. For instance, whether localization of CENP-STWX to inner kinetochores requires CENP-C is controversial. Direct interaction of CENP-STWX to CENP-HIKM has been demonstrated recently and reflects in codependency for kinetochore localization. Both CENP-STWX and CENP-C contribute to recruitment of outer kinetochore components. (B) Schematic representation of human CENP-C depicting some of the protein’s crucial domains. N, N terminus; C, C terminus. (C) Whole cell protein extracts from Flp-In T-REx HeLa cells treated with control or CENP-C siRNAs were run on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for the indicated kinetochore proteins. Vinculin served as a loading control. MWM, molecular weight marker. (D) Representative images showing kinetochore levels of CENP-C, CENP-TW (with an antibody raised against the CENP-TW complex), and CENP-HK (with an antibody raised against the CENP-HK complex) in Flp-In T-REx HeLa cells upon treatment with control and CENP-C siRNA in interphase. Kinetochores were visualized with CREST sera. Upon CENP-C siRNA, CENP-C, CENP-HK, and CENP-TW were displaced from kinetochores. Bars, 10 µm. Magnification = 630×. Insets show a magnification of the white boxed areas that capture one or more kinetochores in each panel. (E) Quantifications are expressed as normalized protein/CREST fluorescence intensity ratios from the experiment in D. Graphs and bars indicate means ± SEM of three independent experiments for CENP-C, CENP-HK, and CENP-TW. (F) SEC elution profile shows CENP-C<sup>2–545</sup> (∼62 kD) elutes earlier than predicted based on its molecular mass, consistent with an unfolded structure. The modest height of the CENP-C peak is caused by low abundance of aromatic amino acids. CENP-C<sup>2–545</sup> and CENP-HIKM, both at 10 µM, form a stable, apparently stoichiometric complex on an analytical SEC. Shown is the typical outcome of at least five experiments. (G) SEC elution profile of CENP-C<sup>189–400</sup> (∼24 kD) and of its combination with CENP-HIKM, both at 5 µM. Also CENP-C<sup>189–400</sup> and CENP-HIKM form a stoichiometric complex and coelute in analytical SEC. Shown is the typical outcome of at least three experiments. The gray dotted lines show the elution profile of globular markers of known molecular masses, as indicated.</p>

      <p>A subset of CCAN subunits, including CENP-N, the CENP-TW complex, and CENP-C, have been recognized as potential “founders” of kinetochore assembly downstream of CENP-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hori et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Guse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 2013</xref>). In vitro, CENP-N has been shown to interact directly with CENP-A nucleosomes (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et al., 2009</xref>). Chl4, the CENP-N orthologue in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, additionally binds tightly to Iml3 (orthologous to CENP-L; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hinshaw and Harrison, 2013</xref>). Although functionally poorly characterized, the CENP-LN complex has been shown to bind directly to CENP-C and to require it for kinetochore localization, at least in yeast (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hinshaw and Harrison, 2013</xref>). In vertebrates, the CENP-LN complex has been shown to contribute to localization of downstream CCAN subunits, including those in the CENP-HIKM complex (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p>
      <p>CENP-T and CENP-W are histone fold domain–containing proteins and form a tightly interacting complex (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Foltz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hori et al., 2008</xref>). They also interact with two additional histone fold domain proteins named CENP-S and CENP-X (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Amano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Nishino et al., 2012</xref>). It has been proposed that the CENP-STWX complex may form a specialized centromeric nucleosome-like structure (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Nishino et al., 2012</xref>), but a recent study suggested that these proteins bind preferentially to internucleosomal linker DNA (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Takeuchi et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, the N-terminal region of CENP-T interacts directly, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, with the Ndc80 subcomplex in the KMN network at the outer kinetochore (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Schleiffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Nishino et al., 2013</xref>), thus contributing to outer kinetochore assembly. When expressed ectopically on a noncentromeric chromosome site, the N-terminal region of CENP-T supported outer kinetochore assembly independently of other inner kinetochore subunits (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hori et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p>CENP-C (943 residues in humans) was among the first human centromere proteins to be discovered (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Earnshaw and Rothfield, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Saitoh et al., 1992</xref>). Sequence analysis predicts that CENP-C is mostly intrinsically disordered. Near its N terminus, CENP-C contains a binding site for the Mis12 subcomplex of the KMN network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Przewloka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Screpanti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hornung et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, CENP-C contains two related short motifs that direct it to the CENP-A nucleosome, an interaction believed to be compatible with CENP-N binding (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Milks et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Guse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, CENP-C, like CENP-T, has the potential to bridge the underlying centromeric chromatin with the outer kinetochore. Finally, the C-terminal region of CENP-C has been shown to mediate dimerization and to promote interactions with CENP-A deposition machinery (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Sugimoto et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Trazzi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Moree et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Dambacher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Unhavaithaya and Orr-Weaver, 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p>The precise localization dependencies of the centromere proximal proteins CENP-C, CENP-N, and CENP-TW are controversial and so is their role in the recruitment of additional CCAN subunits, including those in a four-subunit subcomplex consisting of the CENP-H, CENP-K, CENP-I, and CENP-M subunits (the CENP-HIKM complex), which we have recently characterized (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Basilico et al., 2014</xref>). It has been shown that depletion of CENP-C in HeLa cells leads to mislocalization of the subunits of the CENP-HIKM complex and of CENP-T (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Basilico et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that both localize downstream of CENP-C. Furthermore, CENP-T and the CENP-HIKM subunits were shown to be codependent for kinetochore localization (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hori et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Basilico et al., 2014</xref>). Other studies, however, did not report effects from CENP-C depletion on kinetochore localization of CENP-I or CENP-T (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>). It was therefore proposed that CENP-T may encode a CENP-C–independent pathway of kinetochore assembly downstream of CENP-A (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we provide strong mechanistic insight on the role of CENP-C and identify CENP-C as a blueprint of kinetochore assembly and as the protein that spatially organizes the localization of all other CCAN subunits downstream of CENP-A.</p>

        <title>Depletion of CENP-C disrupts CCAN organization</title>
        <p>We used a protocol previously established in our laboratory (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Basilico et al., 2014</xref>) to achieve substantial CENP-C depletion by RNAi in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>).

Conversely, immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated that the kinetochore levels of CENP-C, CENP-HK, and CENP-TW were strongly reduced in CENP-C–depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). These experiments confirm evidence from our and other laboratories that CENP-TW complex localization to kinetochores requires CENP-C (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Basilico et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Yu, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Krizaic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Logsdon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Tachiwana et al., 2015</xref>).

        <title>CENP-HIKM and CENP-C interact directly</title>
        <p>To investigate whether the observed dependency of the CENP-HIKM complex on CENP-C reflected a direct interaction, we built recombinant versions of CENP-HIKM (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Basilico et al., 2014</xref>) and CENP-C. We did not observe binding of CENP-HIKM to CENP-C constructs encompassing the majority of the C-terminal region (CENP-C<sup>632–943</sup>; unpublished data). Conversely, recombinant CENP-C<sup>2–545</sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201412028/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>) coeluted in a stoichiometric complex with the CENP-HIKM complex from a Superdex 200 size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column, which separates proteins based on size and shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p>
        <p>CENP-C<sup>2–545</sup> contains a Mis12 binding motif (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Przewloka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Screpanti et al., 2011</xref>), a region rich in proline, glutamate, serine, and threonine (PEST in single letter amino acid code) and therefore referred to as “PEST rich” (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>), and a kinetochore targeting domain recently shown to be responsible for a specific interaction with the CENP-A nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Fachinetti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 2013</xref>). We asked whether the PEST domain was involved in CENP-HIKM binding. Indeed, recombinant CENP-C<sup>189–400</sup> (essentially limited to the PEST domain; Fig. S1 B) was sufficient to interact with CENP-HIKM in the SEC assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>). Thus, CENP-C and CENP-HIKM bind directly, and the PEST region of CENP-C is sufficient for this interaction in vitro.</p>

        <title>Characterization of the CENP-C–CENP-HIKM interaction</title>
        <p>Next, we tried to identify which subunits of the CENP-HIKM complex might be involved in the interaction with CENP-C. To this end, we immobilized a GST–CENP-C<sup>2–545</sup> fusion protein to glutathione beads and used it as bait in pull-down assays with CENP-M, the CENP-HK complex, and CENP-I<sup>57–281</sup> (full-length CENP-I could not be produced because it is not soluble in the absence of CENP-M and CENP-HK; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Basilico et al., 2014</xref>). Neither CENP-M nor CENP-I<sup>57–281</sup> bound the GST–CENP-C<sup>2–545</sup> bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In contrast, the CENP-HK complex bound the GST–CENP-C<sup>2–545</sup> bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>) and also the GST–CENP-C<sup>189–400</sup> bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>), indicating that the CENP-HK subcomplex is sufficient for a tight interaction with CENP-C. We conclude that the PEST-rich domain of CENP-C and the CENP-HK subunits of the CENP-HIKM complex are the main determinants of the interaction of CENP-C with the CENP-HIKM complex.</p>

        <title>Further characterization of the CENP-C–CENP-HK interaction</title>
        <p>To further characterize the interaction of CENP-C with CENP-HK, we subjected the CENP-C<sup>2–545</sup>–CENP-HK complex to cross-linking with the bifunctional reagent BS2G (bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]glutarate), which cross-links the primary amines of lysine side chains within a distance compatible with the length of the cross-linker (7.7 Å; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Maiolica et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Herzog et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis identified numerous cross-links between CENP-C and CENP-HK, the majority of which mapped to the PEST domain of CENP-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201412028/DC1" id="supp3">Table S1</ext-link>), in agreement with the binding assays discussed in the previous paragraph.</p>
        <p>Low average representation of hydrophobic residues is a defining feature of intrinsically disordered proteins. Within such proteins, however, binding sites for interacting partners often coincide with short stretches of hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids. We noticed that two closely spaced lysine residues (K271 and K273), which were identified as hotspots in the cross-linking experiments, flank a Leu-Phe-Leu motif (residues 265–267) that appears to be conserved in evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). A second conserved hydrophobic/aromatic motif (residues 317–320) was also identified. Interestingly, both the Leu-Phe-Leu motif and the second motif appear to be present in Mif2p, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> homologue of CENP-C, but in Mif2p their relative position is swapped.</p>
        <p>To test a possible role of the CENP-C hydrophobic motifs in the interaction with the CENP-HIKM complex, we initially divided the CENP-C PEST region in two separate constructs of approximately similar length (CENP-C residues 189–290 and 290–400) each containing only one of the two hydrophobic motifs. As immobilized GST fusion proteins, both CENP-C constructs were sufficient for an interaction with the CENP-HIKM complex in pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>), suggesting that the binding site for CENP-HK on CENP-C is extended, as already suggested by the cross-linking experiments.</p>
        <p>We therefore tested the effects of mutations in the individual hydrophobic motifs of CENP-C. To this end, we created a triple alanine mutant of residues Leu265, Phe266, and Leu267 (henceforth referred to as “3A” mutant) on the GST–CENP-C<sup>189–290</sup> construct (GST–CENP-C<sup>189–290-3A</sup>) as well as a single alanine mutant at residues Trp317 (W317A) on the CENP-C<sup>290–400</sup> construct (CENP-C<sup>290–400-W317A</sup>). Both mutants prevented the interaction of their cognate CENP-C segment with CENP-HIKM, clearly implicating the mutated CENP-C residues in the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, F and G</xref>). On the other hand, mutations in a highly conserved Glu-Phe-Ile-Ile-Asp motif at residues 302–306 of CENP-C did not interfere with the interaction with CENP-HK (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201412028/DC1" id="supp4">Fig. S2, A and B</ext-link>).</p>
        <p>We then combined the mutations (henceforth referred to as “4A” mutant) in the context of the GST–CENP-C<sup>2–545</sup> construct (GST–CENP-C<sup>2–545-4A</sup>) and tested their effects on CENP-HIKM binding. Although neither mutation grossly perturbed CENP-HIKM binding in isolation (unpublished data), their combination disrupted CENP-HIKM binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>), confirming the importance of both hydrophobic motifs in the CENP-C PEST region on the interaction with CENP-HIKM. In SEC experiments, binding of CENP-C<sup>2–545-3A</sup> or CENP-C<sup>2–545-W317A</sup> to CENP-HIKM was partially impaired, whereas the combination of mutations in the CENP-C<sup>2–545-4A</sup> mutant entirely prevented binding to CENP-HIKM (Fig. S1, C–F), demonstrating that the mutations have additive negative effects on the physical interaction of the CENP-HIKM complex and CENP-C. The interaction of CENP-C<sup>2–545-4A</sup> with the Mis12 complex (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Petrovic et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Screpanti et al., 2011</xref>), which involves the N-terminal region of CENP-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), appeared unaltered in comparison to wild-type CENP-C<sup>2–545</sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201412028/DC1" id="supp5">Fig. S3, A–E</ext-link>).</p>

        <title>The CENP-C–CENP-HIKM interaction promotes CENP-HIKM localization to kinetochores</title>
        <p>We asked whether the CENP-HIKM binding interface of CENP-C is important for kinetochore localization of CCAN subunits in HeLa cells. For this, we generated inducible stable cell lines that expressed full-length wild-type GFP–CENP-C, or the 3A, W317A, or 4A mutants (Fig. S3, F and G). After depletion of endogenous CENP-C by RNAi and induction of transgene expression, the levels of CENP-HK at kinetochores were quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>).

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>The CCAN has been implicated in the fascinating mechanism of new CENP-A deposition during the cell cycle, a process that is at the basis of epigenetic inheritance of centromeres (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Fukagawa and Earnshaw, 2014</xref>). Moreover, the inner kinetochore is directly involved in recruiting, shaping, and functionally influencing the outer kinetochore (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Schittenhelm et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Ribeiro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Przewloka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Screpanti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Matson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hori et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hornung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, the CCAN has been implicated in interactions with the microtubule plus end, thus possibly complementing the function of the outer kinetochore in chromosome alignment (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">McClelland et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Amaro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dumont et al., 2012</xref>). Understanding the physical organization of the inner kinetochore is therefore an important goal of current kinetochore research. Here, we have identified the PEST domain of CENP-C as an interaction domain for the CENP-HIKM complex and implicated four conserved residues of CENP-C in this interaction. Mutation of these residues impairs binding of CENP-C to CENP-HIKM (but not to the Mis12 complex) in vitro to undetectable levels and leads to a complete loss of CENP-HIKM kinetochore localization in vivo. The same mutations on CENP-C also lead to a dramatic loss of CENP-TW from kinetochores, which is consistent with our previous observation that CENP-TW binds the CENP-HIKM complex directly (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Basilico et al., 2014</xref>). N-terminal or C-terminal tagging of CENP-C interfered with kinetochore recruitment of the Mis12 complex or with stable incorporation of CENP-C to kinetochores, respectively, preventing us from testing rigorously the effects of the four CENP-C mutations on kinetochore recruitment of the Mis12 complex (unpublished data). However, our results in vitro and previous evidence (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Basilico et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Yu, 2015</xref>) argue that depletion of HIKM subunits is not sufficient for robust displacement of the Mis12 complex from kinetochores.</p>
        <p>Our results are consistent with a model in which CENP-C occupies the first position downstream of CENP-A in a single pathway of kinetochore assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Our data argue that CENP-TW positions itself in this pathway, together with other CCAN subunits, downstream of CENP-C, in agreement with several other studies (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Basilico et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Yu, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Krizaic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Logsdon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Tachiwana et al., 2015</xref>). Claims that CENP-T and CENP-C establish independent pathways of kinetochore recruitment downstream from CENP-A (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Rago et al., 2015</xref>) may reflect differences in the levels of RNAi-based depletion or in the details of the localization analysis. Several CCAN subunits have been implicated in the deposition of new CENP-A required for centromere propagation (see for instance <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Okada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Moree et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Fachinetti et al., 2013</xref>). This is a potential confounding factor because the localization pattern of inner kinetochore proteins cannot be solely viewed as a representation of a static set of protein–protein interactions. Interference with new CENP-A deposition during each cell cycle will eventually affect indirectly the pattern of localization of inner kinetochore subunits, regardless of their direct physical interactions. Be that as it may, our conclusion that CENP-T is positioned downstream of CENP-C is not inconsistent with the identified role of CENP-T in regulating outer kinetochore assembly through an interaction with the Ndc80 complex and possibly other outer kinetochore components (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Schleiffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Nishino et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Yu, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Rago et al., 2015</xref>). The conclusion, however, implies that such role of CENP-TW in kinetochore assembly occurs downstream of CENP-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Dissection of CENP-C is bringing to light a linear organization of binding motifs within a largely structurally disordered protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). Specifically, the N-terminal region and the central domain have been shown to interact with the outer kinetochore and the centromere, respectively (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Przewloka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Screpanti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hornung et al., 2014</xref>), whereas the C-terminal region contains binding sites for proteins involved in new CENP-A deposition and CENP-C dimerization (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Sugimoto et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Trazzi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Moree et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Dambacher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Unhavaithaya and Orr-Weaver, 2013</xref>). We now report that between the outer kinetochore binding site and the CENP-A binding site is a binding site for the CCAN subunits CENP-HIKM. This linear organization of motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>) justifies our interpretation that CENP-C may be a blueprint that determines the correct positioning of kinetochore subunits along the inner to outer kinetochore axis (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>). In the future, it will be important to elucidate the entire network of interactions of CCAN subunits around the CENP-C scaffold through biochemical reconstitution and in vivo validation.</p>

        <title>Expression and purification of CENP-C constructs</title>
        <p>From a codon-optimized cDNA synthesized by GeneArt (Life Technologies) encoding the human CENP-C sequence, different CENP-C constructs have been subcloned in pGEX-6P-2rbs (GenBank accession code <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="KM817768">KM817768</ext-link>), a modified pGEX-6P vector (GE Healthcare; the vector utilizes an inducible <italic>tac</italic> promoter), as a 3′ fusion to the sequence encoding GST. Mutant CENP-C constructs were created by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Agilent Technologies). All constructs and mutants were sequence verified. The expression and purification procedure was the same for all CENP-C constructs and mutants. The parental pGEX-6P-2rbs vector expressing CENP-C<sup>2–545</sup> was a gift of S. Jeganathan (Max-Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology, Dortmund, Germany). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> C41 (DE3) cells harboring vectors expressing CENP-C constructs or CENP-C mutant constructs were grown in Terrific Broth at 37°C to an OD600 of 0.8–1, when 0.2 mM IPTG was added and the culture was grown at 20°C for ∼15 h. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol), lysed by sonication, and cleared by centrifugation at 48,000 <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 30 min. The cleared lysate was applied to glutathione Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated in lysis buffer, incubated at 4°C for 2 h, washed with 70 column volumes of lysis buffer and either subjected to an overnight cleavage reaction with 3C protease to separate CENP-C constructs from GST or eluted in a lysis buffer supplemented with 20 mM glutathione. A 5-ml HiTrap Heparin HP column (GE Healthcare) was preequilibrated in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The eluate from glutathione beads was adjusted to a final salt concentration of 200 mM NaCl, loaded onto the Heparin column, and eluted with a linear gradient of 200–1,200 mM NaCl in 20 bed column volumes. Fractions containing CENP-C were concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 200 SEC column (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated in SEC buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 2.5% glycerol, and 2 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine [TCEP]). Fractions containing CENP-C were concentrated, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C.</p>

        <title>GST pull-down assays</title>
        <p>All GST pull-down experiments were performed using preblocked GSH Sepharose beads in pull-down buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 2.5% glycerol, and 1 mM TCEP). GST–CENP-C various constructs always served as bait at a 1-µM concentration, whereas potential binding partners served as prey at a 3-µM concentration. The bait was loaded to 12-µl preblocked beads, before the prey was added. At the same time, 1 µg of each protein was added into Laemmli sample loading buffer for the input gel. The reaction volume was added up to 40 µl with buffer and incubated at 4°C for 1 h, rotating. Beads were spun down at 500 <italic>g</italic> for 3 min. The supernatant was removed, and beads were washed twice with 250 µl buffer. The supernatant was removed completely, and samples were boiled in 15 µl Laemmli sample loading buffer and run on a 14% SDS-PAGE gel. Bands were visualized with Coomassie brilliant blue staining.</p>

        <title>Analytical SEC migration shift assays</title>
        <p>Analytical SEC experiments were performed on a calibrated Superdex 200 5/150 column (GE Healthcare). All samples were eluted under isocratic conditions at 4°C in SEC buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 2.5% glycerol, and 2 mM TCEP) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Elution of proteins was monitored at 280 nm. 100-µl fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. To detect the formation of a complex, proteins were mixed at the indicated concentrations in 50 µl, incubated for at least 2 h on ice, and then subjected to SEC.</p>

        <title>Cross-linking analysis</title>
        <p>CENP-C<sup>2–545</sup>–CENP-H–CENP-K complex was cross-linked with isotope-labeled disuccinimidyl suberate and digested with Lys-C and trypsin after quenching with ammonium bicarbonate. Cross-linked peptides were enriched using SEC, analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, and identified by the search algorithm, xQuest. Cross-linking, mass spectrometry analysis, and database searching were performed as previously described (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Herzog et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
        <p>Visualization of the cross-links was performed by converting the raw data (in form of Excel spreadsheets) to the GEXF (Graph Exchange XML Format) data format using custom shell scripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201412028/DC1" id="supp6">supplemental material</ext-link>). The data were then imported into the Gephi software that was modified to allow simultaneous calculation and display of curved and straight connectors (i.e., intra- and intermolecular cross-links). The Gephi graph was exported as an Illustrator file (Adobe) for final processing.</p>

        <p>Parental Flp-In T-REx HeLa cells used to generate stable doxycycline-inducible cell lines were a gift from S. Taylor (University of Manchester, Manchester, England, UK). They were grown at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM (PAN Biotech) supplemented with 10% tetracycline-free FBS (Invitrogen) and 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (PAN-Biotech). Flp-In T-REx HeLa cells (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Tighe et al., 2004</xref>) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% tetracycline-free FBS, 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 250 µg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen), and 4 µg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen). GFP–CENP-C fusions were expressed by addition of 25 ng/ml doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 or 48 h. For CENP-C silencing, we used a single siRNA (target sequence: 5′-GGAUCAUCUCAGAAUAGAA-3′ obtained from Sigma-Aldrich), targeting the coding region of endogenous CENP-C mRNA. Transfections were performed with HyPerFect (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To obtain an efficient depletion of CENP-C, 60 nM siRNA was transfected 3× within 72 h. In the last 24 h, 25 ng/ml doxycycline was added to induce GFP–CENP-C construct expression. The siRNA did not affect expression of GFP-CENP. Phenotypes were analyzed 96 h after the first siRNA addition, and protein depletion was monitored by Western blotting or immunofluorescence.</p>

        <title>Mammalian plasmids</title>
        <p>CENP-C constructs were created by cDNA subcloning in pcDNA5/FRT/TO-EGFP-IRES vector, a modified version of pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector (Invitrogen). pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector (Invitrogen) is a tetracycline-inducible expression vector designed for use with the Flp-In T-REx system. It carries a hybrid human cytomegalovirus/TetO2 promoter for high-level, tetracycline-regulated expression of the target gene. The control plasmid for EGFP expression was created by PCR amplifying the EGFP sequence from pEGFP-C1 (Takara Bio Inc.) and cloning it into the pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector previously modified to carry an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) sequence to obtain the pcDNA5/FRT/TO EGFP-IRES vector (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Petrovic et al., 2010</xref>). All plasmids used in the study for mammalian expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>) were derived from the pCDNA5/FRT/TO-EGFP-IRES and used for genomic integration and expression of human CENP-C proteins. To create all N-terminally tagged EGFP fusions, we amplified CENP-C full-length or 1–544 fragments by PCR from a full-length human RNAi-resistant CENP-C cDNA synthesized by GeneArt (Life Technologies) and subcloned them in frame with the EGFP tag into the pcDNA5/FRT/TO EGFP-IRES vector using the restriction sites BamHI and XhoI. Mutant CENP-C constructs were created by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Agilent Technologies). All constructs were sequence verified.</p>

        <p>Cycling cells were harvested by trypsinization and lysed by incubation in lysis buffer (75 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 1.5 mM EGTA, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10% glycerol, 0.075% NP-40, 90 U/ml Benzonase [Sigma-Aldrich], and protease inhibitor cocktail [Serva]) at 4°C for 15 min followed by sonication and centrifugation. Extracts were precleared with a mixture of protein A–Sepharose (CL-4B; GE Healthcare) and protein G–Sepharose (rec-Protein G-Sepharose 4B; Invitrogen) at 4°C for 1 h. Subsequently, extracts were incubated with GFP-Traps (ChromoTek) at 4°C for 3–4 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by Western blotting using 12% NuPAGE gels (Life Technologies). The following antibodies were used: anti-GFP (in house–made rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against full-length GFP from <italic>Aequorea victoria</italic>, full length; 1:4,000), anti-Vinculin (mouse monoclonal, clone hVIN-1; 1:15,000; V9131; Sigma-Aldrich), anti–α-tubulin (mouse monoclonal, T9026; Sigma-Aldrich), anti–CENP-TW (in house–made rabbit polyclonal antibody SI0882, raised against the full-length protein complex; 1:800; a gift of S.

Cells were fixed with PBS/PHEM (Pipes, Hepes, EGTA, and MgCl<sub>2</sub>)-paraformaldehyde 4% followed by permeabilization with PBS/PHEM–Triton X-100 0.5%. The following antibodies were used for immunostaining: anti–CENP-TW (in house–made rabbit polyclonal antibody SI0882, raised against the full-length protein complex; 1:800), CREST/anticentromere antibodies (human autoimmune serum, 1:100; Antibodies, Inc.), anti–CENP-C (SI410; 1:1,000), anti–CENP-HK (SI0930; 1:800). Rodamine red–conjugated, DyLight 405–conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Alexa Fluor 647–labeled secondary antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen. Coverslips were mounted with Mowiol mounting media (EMD Millipore). All experiments were imaged at room temperature using the spinning-disk confocal microscopy of a 3i Marianas system (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) equipped with a microscope (Axio Observer Z1; Carl Zeiss), a confocal scanner unit (CSU-X1; Yokogawa Electric Corporation), Plan Apochromat 63× or 100×/1.4 NA objectives (Carl Zeiss), and camera (Orca Flash 4.0 sCMOS; Hamamatsu Photonics) and converted into maximal intensity projections TIFF files for illustrative purposes. Quantification of kinetochore signals was performed on unmodified z series images using Imaris 7.3.4 software (Bitplane). After background subtraction, all signals were normalized to CREST, and values obtained for control cells were set to 1. Quantifications are based on three independent experiments in which 5–10 cells were analyzed.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Coordination of cell growth and proliferation in response to nutrient supply is mediated by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. In this study, we report that Mio, a highly conserved member of the SEACAT/GATOR2 complex necessary for the activation of mTORC1 kinase, plays a critical role in mitotic spindle formation and subsequent chromosome segregation by regulating the proper concentration of active key mitotic kinases Plk1 and Aurora A at centrosomes and spindle poles. Mio-depleted cells showed reduced activation of Plk1 and Aurora A kinase at spindle poles and an impaired localization of MCAK and HURP, two key regulators of mitotic spindle formation and known substrates of Aurora A kinase, resulting in spindle assembly and cytokinesis defects. Our results indicate that a major function of Mio in mitosis is to regulate the activation/deactivation of Plk1 and Aurora A, possibly by linking them to mTOR signaling in a pathway to promote faithful mitotic progression.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Nup107–160 complex (Nup107 complex) is an evolutionarily conserved nucleoporin subcomplex that plays a crucial role in nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly, mRNA export, and cell differentiation (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Boehmer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Harel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Walther et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">González-Aguilera and Askjaer, 2012</xref>). A small fraction of the Nup107 complex localizes to kinetochores from early prophase to late anaphase (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Belgareh et al., 2001</xref>). Efficient depletion of the Nup107 complex component Seh1 from mammalian cells causes chromosome alignment and segregation defects (<xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">Zuccolo et al., 2007</xref>) by altering the centromeric localization of the chromosomal passenger complex (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Platani et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>During mitosis, a signaling network involving the kinases Aurora A, Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), and CDK1/Cyclin B and their counteracting phosphatases controls the localization and function of various components of the mitotic spindle (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Carmena et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Rieder, 2011</xref>). Aurora A kinase localizes on centrosomes and spindle pole microtubules from late S phase throughout mitosis, where it plays a role in mitotic entry, centrosome maturation and separation, and bipolar spindle formation and function (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Barr and Gergely, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Carmena et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Hochegger et al., 2013</xref>). Aurora A substrates include TPX2 (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Kufer et al., 2002</xref>), TACC3 (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Giet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Barros et al., 2005</xref>), Ajuba (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Hirota et al., 2003</xref>), Eg5 (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Giet et al., 1999</xref>), and HURP (<xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>Plk1 is a critical regulator of mitosis that regulates centrosome maturation, kinetochore–microtubule attachment, and cleavage furrow ingression (<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Petronczki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Bruinsma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">Zitouni et al., 2014</xref>). Spindle pole localization of Plk1 controls recruitment of pericentrin and γ-tubulin complexes to centrosomes (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Lane and Nigg, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Casenghi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Rhee, 2011</xref>) and has also been implicated in centrosome disjunction and separation (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Bruinsma et al., 2012</xref>). Centrosomal Plk1 additionally controls spindle positioning and orientation by regulating binding of the dynein–dynactin complex to its cortical targeting factors Numa and LGN (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>). During prometaphase, Plk1 localization at kinetochores is required for chromosome alignment and faithful chromosome segregation (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Elowe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Maia et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
      <p>Mitotic activity of Aurora A and Plk1 kinases is controlled by a balance of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in time and space. Aurora A activation depends on the autophosphorylation of Thr288 in its activation loop, which occurs primarily at centrosomes (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Littlepage et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Zorba et al., 2014</xref>) and on TPX2-mediated localization and activation on spindle microtubules (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Kufer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bayliss et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Eyers and Maller, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Tsai et al., 2003</xref>). Aurora A/Bora activates Plk1 at centrosomes in late G2/prophase via phosphorylation of its activation loop at Thr210 (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Macůrek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Seki et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
      <p>Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in cell proliferation, cell size regulation, transcription, and cytoskeletal regulation in response to a variety of input signals (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Harris and Lawrence, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Jacinto and Hall, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Wullschleger et al., 2006</xref>). Two mTOR complexes have been identified in mammalian cells mTORC1 and mTORC2 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Guertin and Sabatini, 2007</xref>). The mTORC1 complex contains the regulatory protein raptor and, by regulating the phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase and 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1), controls their downstream functions in protein translation, cell growth, and cell proliferation (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Loewith et al., 2002</xref>). mTORC2 contains the regulatory subunit rictor and is involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Jacinto et al., 2004</xref>). Almost all documented mTOR functions take place during interphase, although the mTORC1 complex has been implicated in mitotic entry in fission yeast through the stress MAPK pathway (<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Petersen and Nurse, 2007</xref>). mTORC1 activation requires Rag-GTPases, two regulators of which have recently been identified: the SEACAT/GATOR1 and 2 subcomplexes (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Panchaud et al., 2013b</xref>).</p>
      <p>Here, we have identified a mitotic role for Mio, a highly conserved member of the SEACAT/GATOR2 complex, which regulates Rag-1 and mTOR signaling (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bar-Peled et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Panchaud et al., 2013a</xref>). We show that Mio is required for spindle formation and subsequent chromosome segregation and for the proper concentration of active Plk1 and Aurora A kinases at centrosomes and spindle poles. Our results suggest that Mio may regulate the activation/deactivation of Plk1 and Aurora A, possibly by linking them to mTOR signaling in a pathway that promotes faithful mitotic progression.</p>

        <p>Seh1 is a member of the Nup107 complex that functions in NPC assembly and localizes to kinetochores in mitosis (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Belgareh et al., 2001</xref>).

This analysis identified all known Seh1-interacting proteins, including components of the Nup107 complex (Nup107, 98, 133, 160, and 85) and SEACAT/GATOR2 complexes (Mios, WDR24, and WDR59; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201410001/DC1" id="supp1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Dokudovskaya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bar-Peled et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Panchaud et al., 2013a</xref>). Interestingly, Seh1 interacts with the SEACAT/GATOR2 complex equally in interphase and mitosis, whereas its interaction with the rest of the Nup107 complex is stronger during mitosis.</p>

Cells were differentially labeled with isotopic amino acids by growth in SILAC media before immunopurification of GFP-Seh1 complexes. Where indicated, cells were arrested in mitosis using 200 ng/ml nocodazole for 14 h. Immunopurified GFP-Seh1 complexes were analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry. Plot of log ratio H/M versus relative abundance (summarized peptide intensities normalized by molecular weight) for all quantified proteins is shown. Bait protein GFP-Seh1 (green circles) and the interactors Nup107 complex (purple diamonds) and SEACAT/GATOR2 complex (blue diamonds) are highlighted. This nonbiased quantitative experiment was performed twice in asynchronous cell populations and once in mitotically arrested cells, and top hits were chosen for targeted follow-up validation by immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. (B) Mio interacts with Seh1 in mammalian cells. Immunoprecipitates (IP) are shown of total protein extracts from HeLa cells transfected with mCherry, mCherry-Mio, and EGFP-Seh1. Immunoprecipitation was performed using α-RFP binder, and Seh1 was detected using α-Seh1 antibody. (C) Immunoblots of HeLa cell lysates treated with siRNAs corresponding to negative control and Seh1 (probed using α-Mio and α-Seh1) show that depletion of Seh1 can affect Mio stability.

        <p>We confirmed the Mio–Seh1 interaction using recombinant mCherry-Mio expressed in mammalian cells. Seh1 coimmunoprecipitated with mCherry-Mio protein but not with the mCherry control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Furthermore, levels of endogenous Mio protein were reduced in HeLa cells upon Seh1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Because Seh1 overexpression does not increase Mio protein levels (<xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Senger et al., 2011</xref>), this suggests that Seh1 promotes Mio’s stability in mammalian cells. Although Seh1 is a nucleoporin, depletion of Mio resulted in no detectable changes in NPC structure or assembly that could be detected by mAb414 staining against FG repeat nucleoporins. The nuclear rim localization of endogenous Seh1 also appeared not to be affected (Fig. S1 B).</p>

        <title>Mio depletion causes mitotic defects</title>
        <p>Having previously described a requirement for Seh1 for mitotic progression (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Platani et al., 2009</xref>), we next explored the role of Mio in mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. RNAi depletion of Mio resulted in an increase in the number of binucleate cells, micronucleation, and aberrant nuclear morphology with a variety of different oligos against Mio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>; and see the following paragraphs). To better define the Mio depletion phenotype in living cells, we used time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy. Cells transfected with control siRNA underwent mitosis with normal timing, and cytokinesis was completed within 2 h followed by a period in interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Apoptotic events were rarely seen (1.6%), indicating that phototoxicity is minimal under our imaging conditions. Mio-depleted cells remained in mitosis and cytokinesis for extended periods of time before either furrow ingression resulted in binucleation, a period in interphase, or apoptosis (which was observed both during mitosis and interphase; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Mio is therefore required for normal mitotic progression. Interestingly, Mio depletion did not result in an increase in the fraction of cells in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Therefore, the increased time that cells spend in mitosis must be counterbalanced by a decrease in mitotic entry.</p>

        <p>More detailed live cell imaging of cells stably expressing mRFP-H2B and EGFP–α-tubulin or EGFP-H2B alone revealed that the kinetics of bipolar spindle formation was abnormal in Mio-depleted cells, although chromosomes eventually aligned on what appeared to be a metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201410001/DC1" id="supp2">Fig. S2 D</ext-link>). Phenotypic analysis of mitotic progression in Mio-depleted cultures showed an increase in prometaphase cells (from 13 to 28%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>) with spindles often in closer proximity to one side of the cell. During mitotic exit, chromosome segregation defects, including increased chromatin bridges and micronucleation, were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Cytokinesis also appeared to be delayed (the percentage of cells in cytokinesis increased from 26 to 37%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). In 6.9% of cells, no furrow ingression was observed followed by either fusion of chromatin masses or production of binucleate cells (the latter increased twofold relative to control-depleted cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Whereas control cells progressed to anaphase soon after metaphase chromosome alignment (31.35 ± 5.2 min), Mio depletion resulted in a prolongation of the period from nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) to anaphase onset (40.5 ± 9.4 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). In addition, Mio-depleted cells showed an uneven timing of daughter cell adhesion to the substratum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>), a characteristic of uneven cell division, as orientation of the cell division plane is controlled by the orientation of the mitotic spindle relative to the cell cortex.</p>

        <title>Mio depletion results in spindle and centrosomal defects</title>
        <p>The previous observations suggested a potential defect in spindle formation and/or chromosome capture after Mio depletion. However, Mio-depleted cells displayed no obvious defects in kinetochore–microtubule interactions, checkpoint proteins, or checkpoint bypass, at least as reported by Bub1 and Sgo1 staining and the ability of cells to undergo mitotic arrest in nocodazole (Fig. S2, A–C). We therefore looked in detail at centrosome-mediated spindle formation.</p>
        <p>Closer inspection of the distribution of α-tubulin and the centrosomal markers γ-tubulin and pericentrin in Mio-depleted cells revealed an increase in several spindle defects. These included abnormal tilt of the spindle axis, disrupted or unfocused spindle poles, monopolar spindles, displacement of the spindle from the cell center toward the cell cortex, and failure of centrosomes to localize at both spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Most depleted cells showed one or a combination of the aforementioned phenotypes.</p>

        <p>To measure the orientation of the mitotic spindle in relation to the substratum, 3D image stacks were acquired for Mio-depleted cells grown on fibronectin-coated coverslips. In control RNAi cells grown on these coverslips, the metaphase spindle axis tends to align parallel to the substratum. Although spindle length was normal in Mio-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>), the spindle azimuth, as judged by the metaphase angle α, was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>).

At 30 min after Monastrol washout, control mitotic cells had rapidly formed a bipolar spindle, with only 40% of cells still having a disorganized spindle. In contrast, at 30 min after Monastrol washout, Mio-depleted cells had a pronounced delay in bipolar spindle formation, with 76% of cells having monopolar or incomplete bipolar spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

        <title>Plk1 and Aurora A are misregulated after Mio depletion</title>
        <p>To characterize the mechanism underlying the various defects in Mio-depleted mitotic cells, we focused on Plk1 and Aurora A. Both of these mitotic kinases have numerous important roles in spindle formation and centrosome separation (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Lens et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
        <p>Limiting titration of the specific Plk1 inhibitor BI2356 revealed a synthetic interaction with Mio depletion. In Mio-depleted cells, lower concentrations of BI2536 caused a synergistic increase in the percentage of cells with monopolar spindles relative to the same drug treatment of control RNAi cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A–C</xref>). Thus, cells depleted of Mio assembled monopolar spindles at concentrations of the drug that did not appreciably affect cells after the control RNAi. This was seen most clearly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>, which plots Δ, the difference in the percentage of monopolar spindles after drug treatments with or without Mio RNAi. A positive slope of Δ indicates a synthetic response, whereas a horizontal line indicates no increase in drug sensitivity after Mio RNAi. It is important to note that after an initial strong synthetic response, the Δ curve for Plk1 inhibition decreases because both the control and Mio-depleted samples are approaching a limit of 90% monopolar cells.</p>

        <p>Depletion of Mio had significant effects on the activation of Aurora A and Plk1 at centrosomes. For example, although we observed no changes in total Aurora A localization or the amount on centrosomes and spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>), the level of active Aurora A (Aurora A<sup>T288ph</sup>, which is phosphorylated at Thr288 on the activation loop) on centrosomes was significantly lower in Mio-depleted cells than in RNAi control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, B and D</xref>). We confirmed this by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 G</xref>). Rescue experiments on HeLa si02ResGFP-Mio cells, where the endogenous Mio was depleted using si02, rescued the prometaphase delay phenotype and restored Aurora A<sup>T288ph</sup> levels at spindle poles (Fig. S1, C–E). Depletion of all Mio using si01 gave the expected prometaphase delay and reduced Aurora A<sup>T288ph</sup> signal.</p>

        <p>Protein phosphatase 6 regulates mitotic spindle formation by controlling the T loop phosphorylation of Aurora A bound to its activator TPX2 (<xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, PPP6C depletion would enhance Aurora A activity and potentially restore the mitotic function of Mio-depleted cells. Indeed, co-depletion of Mio and PPP6C (catalytic subunit; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 C</xref>) rescued the prometaphase delay phenotype and restored Aurora A<sup>T288ph</sup> levels at spindle poles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10, A and B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Plk1 localization and activity also showed a strong response to Mio depletion. Centrosomal levels of both total Plk1 and active PLK1<sup>T210ph</sup> were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, C and E</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201410001/DC1" id="supp4">Fig. S5 C</ext-link>).

        <title>Localization of HURP and MCAK is altered upon Mio depletion</title>
        <p>Both Aurora A and Plk1 are regulatory kinases. We therefore sought to identify downstream effectors that might be responsible for the spindle and mitotic abnormalities observed after Mio depletion and the consequent loss of active Aurora A and Plk1 from centrosomes.</p>
        <p>One likely target is HURP, whose binding to microtubules is regulated by Aurora A phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2008</xref>). HURP is part of a Ran-dependent complex required for chromatin-dependent microtubule nucleation (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Koffa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Silljé et al., 2006</xref>). In control RNAi cells, HURP was localized to spindle microtubules in a band transverse to the spindle axis that was maximal in the vicinity of chromosomes. This localization is consistent with the regulation of HURP by Ran-GTP.</p>
        <p>The distribution of HURP on the spindle was dramatically altered upon Mio depletion. The protein was then evenly distributed throughout the spindle, and the chromosome-proximal characteristic band was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). A similar mislocalization of HURP was previously seen in cells treated with selective Aurora A inhibitors or depleted of the Aurora A–activating partner TPX2 (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Kesisova et al., 2013</xref>).</p>

        <p>This effect of Mio depletion on HURP appears to be quite specific. TPX2 is a partner of HURP in a complex that contributes to Ran-dependent bipolar spindle formation (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Koffa et al., 2006</xref>). No changes were observed in either localization or abundance of TPX2 in Mio-depleted cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201410001/DC1" id="supp5">Fig. S4, A and C</ext-link>). TPX2 is an important activator of Aurora A (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Kufer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Tsai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Özlü et al., 2005</xref>), and these observations therefore suggest that the decrease in the levels of active Aurora A<sup>T288ph</sup> is likely not due to altered TPX2 protein levels. Aurora A still interacted with TPX2 after Mio depletion (Fig. S4 C). Kinase assays on TPX2–Aurora A complexes confirmed a reduction of Aurora A kinase activity toward TPX2 and histone H3 (Fig. S4 D).</p>
        <p>Localization of a second important Aurora A substrate was also changed after Mio RNAi. MCAK is a microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin that has an essential role in chromosome segregation by controlling kinetochore–microtubule attachments (<xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Tanenbaum et al., 2011</xref>). MCAK is localized to inner centromeres, kinetochores, and spindle poles of mitotic cells, and its subcellular localization and activity are controlled by phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Andrews et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, the spindle pole association of MCAK is dependent on Aurora A phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
        <p>The level of centrosomal MCAK was dramatically reduced in cells exposed to Mio RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). In contrast, the pool of kinetochore-associated MCAK appeared unaffected by Mio depletion. In cells exposed to control RNAi, GFP-MCAK localized to both kinetochores and spindle poles as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 1983</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Lane and Nigg, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Logarinho and Sunkel, 1998</xref>). The level of centrosomal MPM2 staining (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 1983</xref>) was dramatically reduced in cells exposed to Mio RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>), confirming a reduction of Plk1 activity at the centrosomes (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Lane and Nigg, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Logarinho and Sunkel, 1998</xref>).</p>
        <p>These effects of Mio depletion were specific for HURP and MCAK and were not a result of a general disruption of the centrosome. It has been suggested that Plk1 activity also contributes to centrosomal localization of the plus end–directed bipolar kinesin Eg5 before mitotic entry (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bertran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). Eg5 localized normally to centrosomes in Mio-depleted cells (Fig. S4 B; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Lane and Nigg, 1996</xref>). Thus, interphase CDK and Plk1 activities in Mio-depleted cells are sufficient to load Eg5 on centrosomes before mitotic entry (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 1983</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Logarinho and Sunkel, 1998</xref>).</p>
        <p>NuMA, LGN, and the dynein–dynactin motor complex function at the cell cortex, where they help to generate pulling forces on astral microtubules and direct spindle rotation (<xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Woodard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>). Both NuMA and the dynactin subunit p150 localized normally to spindles and spindle poles in Mio-depleted cells (Fig. S5). However, cortical levels of p150 were slightly increased near the spindle pole (Fig. S5 B). This was the exact opposite from the expected cortical p150 localization at the cortex furthest away from the pole. The above observation is consistent with the hypothesis that spindle pole–localized active Plk1 regulates dynactin complex dissociation from the cell cortex during spindle orientation.</p>

        <title>Mitotic progression is impaired in the absence of the Mio Ring/PHD domain</title>
        <p>Mio is highly conserved from yeast to mammals (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Iida and Lilly, 2004</xref>). Its N-terminal domain contains several WD40 repeats that are likely to be involved in protein–protein interaction (<xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 1999</xref>). Mio also has a C-terminal domain with a pattern of conserved histidine and cysteine residues resembling a RING/PHD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). Such RING/PHD domains frequently mediate E3 ligase activity (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009</xref>). We used the Protein Homology/Analogy Recognition Engine version 2.0 (Phyre2) server (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Kelley and Sternberg, 2009</xref>) to model Mio’s RING/PHD domain structure on the crystal structure of Ring E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF8 bound to a UBC13/MMS2 heterodimer (Protein Data Bank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="PDB" xlink:href="4ORH">4ORH</ext-link>). Cysteine and histidine residues that are predicted to coordinate the two zinc atoms and help maintain the domain structure are highlighted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>, A [red] and B [labels]). Based on this model, we decided to create two Mio mutants: a C-terminal RING/PHD deletion (ΔPHD) missing the last 91 amino acids and a combination of eight specific point mutations (C785, C788, C830, H832, H835, H838, C849, and C854) that convert predicted zinc-binding cysteine and histidine residues to alanine. This would be predicted to disrupt the folding of the Ring domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>).</p>

Although levels of total mTOR appeared unaffected by Mio depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 C</xref>), levels of active mTOR (mTOR<sup>S2481ph</sup>) on centrosomes and spindles were much lower in Mio-depleted cells than in control RNAi cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, A and B</xref>).</p>

        <p>We next examined phosphorylation of known mTORC1 substrates as a direct measure of mTORC1 activity. Amino acid withdrawal leads to rapid mTORC1 inactivation (<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Sancak et al., 2008</xref>). Mio depletion strongly inhibited the amino acid–induced activation of mTORC1 as monitored by levels of S6K1 and 4EBP1 phosphorylation (Fig. S4 F). Rescue experiments on HeLa si02ResGFP-Mio cells where only the endogenous Mio was depleted using si02 (si01 targets both endogenous and exogenous constructs) restored both mTOR<sup>S2481ph</sup> levels at spindle poles and p70S6K<sup>T389ph</sup> phosphorylation (Fig. S4, E and F).</p>
        <p>If Mio depletion disrupts mitotic progression by inhibiting mTOR, activation of the kinase by an alternative pathway might be expected to at least partially rescue the Mio depletion phenotype. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) dephosphorylates phosphoinositide-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), a potent activator of AKT kinase signaling (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Maehama and Dixon, 1998</xref>). mTOR is a key downstream target of AKT (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Sabatini, 2006</xref>); thus, PTEN inactivation results in increased mTOR activity.

      <p>Mio is a component of the SEACAT/GATOR2 complex, which has been reported to be involved in mTOR regulation by the Rag-GTPase (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bar-Peled et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Panchaud et al., 2013a</xref>). Here, we confirm that Mio interacts with Seh1, a member of the SEACAT/GATOR2 and Nup107 nucleoporin complexes, both in interphase and mitosis. Our experiments identified roles for Mio in timely mitotic progression, centrosome separation, spindle formation, and orientation/positioning in human mitotic cells. Indeed, 35% of mitotic cells observed after Mio depletion had a bipolar, monoastral structure (i.e., they lacked a centrosome and astral microtubules at one of the two spindle poles). Functional analysis revealed that Mio plays a critical role in activation of the essential mitotic kinases, Aurora A and Plk1, at spindle poles. We could find no role for Mio in NPC assembly or structure, suggesting that the mitotic phenotypes of Mio depletion may reflect the loss of SEACAT/GATOR2 regulation of mTOR kinase signaling. Thus, our experiments reveal a previously unsuspected role for mTOR in mitotic regulation.</p>
      <p>Centrosome separation and bipolar spindle formation both require Plk1 and Aurora A activity. Mio depletion caused a marked reduction of active Aurora A<sup>T288ph</sup> without changes in the localization or levels of total Aurora A or TPX2. Spindle length was normal after Mio depletion, which is consistent with the interaction between Aurora A and TPX2 being unaffected (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bird and Hyman, 2008</xref>) and suggesting that the reduction of Aurora A<sup>T288ph</sup> levels observed upon Mio depletion was not a result of the loss of TPX2-mediated activation. Despite the reduced activity of Aurora A and defects in centrosome separation after Mio depletion, bipolar spindle formation still occurred, possibly as a result of microtubule nucleation from chromosomes via the Ran-GTP pathway (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Caudron et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Kaláb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Kalab and Heald, 2008</xref>).</p>

Plk1 localization influences its activity and vice versa (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Kishi et al., 2009</xref>). Upon Mio depletion, levels of total Plk1 and active Plk1<sup>T210ph</sup> were reduced at centrosomes. As a result, Mio-depleted cells were hypersensitive to Plk1 inhibition as detected by synthetic interaction with the Plk1 inhibitor BI2536, resulting in an increase in monopolar spindles even at low drug concentrations. The reduction in active Plk1 levels in Mio-depleted cells may result in a partial inhibition of mitotic entry and may explain the apparent paradox that Mio-depleted cells exhibit a substantial delay in mitotic progression without an accompanying increase in mitotic index.</p>
      <p>Mio depletion from HeLa cells causes multiple mitotic defects such as a lengthening of the interval between NEBD and anaphase onset, spindle assembly defects including an increase in the number of bipolar monoastral spindles, a prometaphase delay often associated with monopolar spindles, and a delay or failure in cytokinesis. Interestingly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>
<italic>melanogaster</italic>, where Mio has been reported to play a role in oocyte maturation, the microtubule-dependent translocation of centrioles from the anterior to the posterior of stage 1 oocyte nuclei is defective, as is the microtubule-dependent translocation of RNA-binding protein Orb (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Iida and Lilly, 2004</xref>). Thus, the involvement of Mio with microtubule function is conserved across species.</p>
      <p>Aurora A regulates mitotic spindle formation at least partially as part of a multiprotein subunit complex containing HURP, TPX2, and Eg5 kinesin (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Koffa et al., 2006</xref>). HURP is a microtubule stabilizer (<xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Silljé et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Santarella et al., 2007</xref>) that localizes mainly to kinetochore microtubules and requires Aurora A phosphorylation for its microtubule binding (<xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2008</xref>). TPX2 binds to and activates Aurora A on the mitotic spindle (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Kufer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Giubettini et al., 2011</xref>). Eg5 is required for centrosome separation after NEBD (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Mardin and Schiebel, 2012</xref>). Our analysis of mitotic spindles after Mio depletion showed a dramatic change in HURP localization, with the protein spreading throughout the spindle, as previously seen upon Aurora A kinase inhibition (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Kesisova et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, we observed a decrease in Aurora A activation (detected as a decrease in Aurora A phosphorylated on its activation loop at Thr288) on Mio-depleted mitotic spindles. Eg5 and TPX2 localization, on the other hand, appeared to be unaffected. Thus, defects in Eg5 localization to centrosomes and microtubules are unlikely to explain the bipolar, monoastral spindles observed in 35% of Mio-depleted mitotic cells.</p>
      <p>The kinesin-13 family microtubule depolymerase MCAK associates with centromeres and growing microtubule ends, where it plays a role in correction of kinetochore–microtubule misattachments from prophase to anaphase. MCAK also localizes to spindle poles, where it is required for the assembly and dynamics of the mitotic spindle. MCAK localization at the centromere and its depolymerase activity are regulated by Aurora B (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Andrews et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Kline-Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Lan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Knowlton et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, MCAK localization at the poles is regulated by Aurora A activity (<xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). In Mio-depleted cells, we observed a reduction of MCAK localization at the poles, whereas MCAK’s centromeric localization appeared to be unaffected. Interference with MCAK activity specifically at centrosomes could partly explain the spindle assembly defects observed upon Mio depletion.</p>
      <p>mTOR plays key roles in several cellular processes through interactions with other proteins to form mTOR complexes 1 and 2 (mTORC1/2). mTORC1 positively regulates cell growth, proliferation, and the cell cycle, whereas mTORC2 plays key roles in cell survival, metabolism, and actin organization (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Laplante and Sabatini, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Proud, 2011</xref>). Recent studies have suggested a link between mTORC1 and mitosis. mTORC1 complex components have been shown to associate with mitotic spindles in mouse oocytes (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Kogasaka et al., 2013</xref>), and overexpression of mTORC1 results in impairment of spindle formation and aneuploidy (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Astrinidis et al., 2006</xref>). In yeast, Aurora A promotes cell division during recovery from mTOR-mediated cell cycle arrest by driving spindle pole body recruitment of Polo (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Hálová and Petersen, 2011</xref>), while at the same time overexpression of Plk1 increases the phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Renner et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting the existence of a molecular and functional link between Plk1 mitotic kinase, mTOR signaling, and spindle formation.</p>
      <p>Here, we show for the first time that mTORC1 is an important regulator of mitotic spindle assembly. Our results reveal a link between Mio and SEACAT/GATOR2 complex (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bar-Peled et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Panchaud et al., 2013a</xref>) regulation of mTORC1 kinase and the spatiotemporal activation of Aurora A and Plk1 at centrosomes during mitosis. The function of Mio in the SEACAT/GATOR2 complex is not known. Although we have been unable to confirm any E3 enzymatic activity for purified Mio in vitro, the presence of a RING/PHD domain in Mio suggests that the protein might control the stability/interaction of key components of the mTOR signaling pathway. Indeed, the inability of Mio RING/PHD domain mutants to rescue mitotic progression suggests that the RING/PHD domain does play a role in Mio function during mitosis. Future studies will focus on the role of Mio in the SEACAT/GATOR2 complex and the mechanisms by which this complex links mTOR signaling to the regulation of Aurora A and Plk1 at mitotic centrosomes.</p>

Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in a 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS solution for 10 min and permeabilized in PBS–0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were blocked in 10% normal donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature before antibody incubations. For γ-tubulin staining, cells were fixed in 100% methanol for 10 min and rehydrated in PBS for 20 min before staining. For Bub1, MPM2, and Sgo1 staining, a prepermeabilization step with 0.1% Triton X-100 in Pipes-Hepes-EGTA-MgCl<sub>2</sub> buffer for 1 min was included followed by PFA fixation.

        <p>For spindle length measurements, cells were stained with centromeric marker (ACA) to identify clear metaphase plates and centrosome marker (pericentrin). Pole to pole measurements were made from single sections of 3D datasets using OMERO. Only spindles parallel to the plane of focus were used to avoid artifacts that can be created by spindle rotation into the plane of focus. Spindle rotation measurements of the metaphase spindle with respect to the fibronectin substratum were performed as previously described (<xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Toyoshima and Nishida, 2007</xref>).

In brief, for efficient elution of bound proteins, a bead equivalent volume of 1% SDS was added, heated at 95°C for 10 min, and then a 4× volume of dH<sub>2</sub>O was added. The matrix was mixed, and the solution was removed and reduced to the original bead-equivalent volume using a speedvac.

Sample buffer was added, and proteins were separated on 10% Bis-Tris gels. Gels were Coomassie stained and destained overnight before excision of 10 gel slices. Peptides resulting from in-gel digestion with trypsin (Promega) were extracted from the gel slices. An aliquot of each tryptic digest was analyzed by liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry on a mass spectrometer with a nanospray source (LTQ Orbitrap XL hybrid; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and an HPLC (UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano; Dionex).

  <body>
    <p>It’s hard to tell by the depth of her CV, but Sally Horne-Badovinac took a very unlikely path to become a scientist. She dropped out of her senior year of high school, leaving behind a “horrendously bad” transcript, to live near the beach in Puerto Rico and wait tables.</p>
    <p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><caption><p>Sally Horne-Badovinac</p><p>PHOTO COURTESY OF MONICA WHARTON PHOTOGRAPHY</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_2101pi_Fig1"/></fig>After five years of exploring, she reentered academics and found her stride when she walked into John Postlethwait’s zebrafish laboratory at the University of Oregon in Eugene. Her stint there inspired her to pursue zebrafish gut morphogenesis in graduate school with Didier Stainier at the University of California, San Francisco (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). As a postdoc in David Bilder’s group at the University of California, Berkeley, she became fascinated by a remarkable piece of developmental biology—the rotating, elongating egg chambers of the fruit fly ovary.</p>
    <p>In 2008, she established her own laboratory at The University of Chicago to dissect this structure’s peculiar planar polarity phenomenon in which the layer of epithelial follicle cells that surrounds the germ cells migrates as a sheet (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Her group has shown that, during this migration, the kinase Misshapen (Msn) decreases integrin levels at the trailing edge of each cell (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and that the basement membrane (BM) covering the entire egg chamber is secreted in a polarized manner along two axes (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Last year, her lab found that the epithelial rotation was key to producing the near-perfect alignment of contractile actin bundles in the follicle cells, which are thought to form a “molecular corset” that squeezes the egg chamber from spherical to football shaped (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).<disp-quote><p>“It’s an amazingly good investment for a postdoc to do a genetic screen.”</p></disp-quote></p>
    <p>She recently shared with <italic>JCB</italic> why she is captivated by cells that cooperate to rearrange tissues and what makes a good scientific hero.</p>

      <title>FRESH STARTS</title>
      <p>
        <bold>
          <italic>How did you go from waiting tables to developmental biology graduate student?</italic>
        </bold>
      </p>
      <p>I started taking night classes at Oregon Institute of Technology in tiny Klamath Falls. One day, I walked into the dean’s office unannounced, told her my story, and asked if I could go to school there. She walked me over to the registrar’s office and told them to admit me. So I was admitted into a four-year school without ever having taken the SAT.</p>
      <p>I got straight As, and at the end of that year, I transferred to University of Oregon. But I didn’t really have any sense of what it was like to be in a laboratory. The first person I went to talk to was John Postlethwait, and at the end of our conversation, he said, “Let’s start your training next Friday.”</p>
      <p>It worked out spectacularly well because zebrafish was really up-and-coming as a model organism and the whole community had been founded in Eugene. That was when I got introduced to developmental biology and I was completely hooked.</p>
      <p>
        <bold>
          <italic>In graduate school, how did you discover what causes the zebrafish gut to loop to the left of midline?</italic>
        </bold>
      </p>
      <p>When I got to Didier’s lab, I became immediately interested in morphogenesis and how cells work collectively to create the shape of an organ. Originally, I was trying to understand how the lumen forms in the primitive gut tube. I was looking at sections under the microscope when I happened to notice an asymmetric pattern of folds in the adjacent tissue of the lateral plate mesoderm. That pattern immediately suggested what the morphogenesis was going to be to push that gut tube over to the left.</p>
      <p>I think that seeing this pattern was my most magical moment in science. I felt like the whole way it was going to work just clicked in my mind. I dragged everyone in the lab to the whiteboard and started drawing, saying, “It works like this!”</p>
      <p>
        <bold><italic>How did you end up working on</italic> Drosophila <italic>egg chambers?</italic></bold>
      </p>
      <p>As a postdoc with David Bilder, I wanted to work on an epithelial morphogenesis process that happens in egg chambers at a later stage than what we currently study. I did a forward genetic screen to try to identify required factors, but it quickly became obvious that those mutations were not coming out of the screen.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I started reading a lot of papers about oogenesis and this unusual planar polarity that occurs at the basal surface of the epithelium. And what <italic>was</italic> coming out of my screen were mutations that made the egg round instead of oblong. I thought this might actually be a much more rich and informative process to study.</p>
      <p>
        <bold>
          <italic>Did you screen all 5,000 mutants by eye yourself?</italic>
        </bold>
      </p>
      <p>I had a technician working with me full time who helped with all of the genetics, fly-pushing, dissecting the ovaries out of the flies, and mounting of slides. But yeah, every single slide passed under my eyes. I would sometimes sit at the microscope for 6–8 hours at a time and the entire screen took about a year and a half.</p>
      <p>But it was worth it. We ended up with a marvelous collection of mutations, which is an ideal way to start a lab because you automatically have built-in projects for all of your first people. So I think it’s an amazingly good investment for a postdoc to do a genetic screen.</p>

        </fig>
        <bold>
          <italic>Who discovered that these egg chambers were rotating during their development?</italic>
        </bold>
      </p>
      <p>A graduate student in the Bilder lab, Saori Haigo, began doing live imaging and discovered the rotational motion. After Saori’s paper was published, someone dug very deep into the literature and found that a researcher at ETH Zurich named D.F. Went had documented this motion in the ovaries of a gall midge in the 1970s with a 16 mm camera.</p>
      <p>I never cease being surprised—<italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis has been intensively studied for decades and no one knew this was happening. You never look at a female fly the same way if you think about these little egg chambers going around in her ovaries.</p>
      <p>
        <bold>
          <italic>Why study egg chambers?</italic>
        </bold>
      </p>
      <p>Everything that we’re studying is happening on the outer surface of this living, intact, organ-like structure. We can visualize these events with exquisite clarity, both what’s happening with the migrating cells and with the extracellular matrix.</p>
      <p>What’s really useful for us right now is the ability to study collective cell migration and BM dynamics in a way that hasn’t really been done before. Collective cell migration happens over and over during development, with cells migrating in cohorts or sheets.</p>
      <p>To migrate collectively, they’re using the same basic cell migration machinery. But what gets added on top of that is the ability of each cell to influence the migratory behavior of its neighbors. We’re interested in how these cells communicate with one another to achieve this efficient group dynamic.</p>
      <p>
        <bold>
          <italic>In contrast, you found that Msn acts in a cell-autonomous way within the migrating sheet. Why is that key?</italic>
        </bold>
      </p>
      <p>At first, people had speculated that the planar organization of actin bundles at the basal surface could arise through a system where a signal propagates from one cell to the next across the tissue. That could be happening from cell to cell, or from cell to ECM to cell.</p>
      <p>Knowing that Msn was a kinase, it seemed reasonable that it might be part of such a signaling system. But instead, we found out it’s just a fundamental protein that’s required for an individual cell to migrate. We had to start thinking about the system really differently—how does something required in each individual cell to migrate somehow lead to this planar organization of the entire tissue?</p>
      <p>It made us realize that it was the migratory behavior of the cells that was probably bringing those actin bundles into alignment across the tissue.<disp-quote><p>“The migratory behavior of the cells was probably bringing those actin bundles into alignment.”</p></disp-quote></p>

      <title>SUPPORTING ACTORS</title>
      <p>
        <bold>
          <italic>Why switch gears to look at secretion of BM proteins?</italic>
        </bold>
      </p>
      <p>This was a total surprise and why doing forward genetics is so much fun. The first mutated gene we identified in my lab from that round egg screen encoded an enzyme required in the endoplasmic reticulum for the folding of collagen IV—an ingredient in the BM. One of my first graduate students, David Lerner, was fascinated by these cells that had collagen trapped inside.</p>
      <p>We eventually realized that all of this BM secretion machinery was not only polarized along the apical-basal axis, but it was also polarized along the planar axis, toward the trailing edge of the migrating cells. We still don’t know whether that is a significant finding for the biology. But it was a really striking observation of how localized all of this machinery was, at both the cell and tissue level.</p>
      <p>
        <bold>
          <italic>Did that give your developmental biology lab a cell biology twist?</italic>
        </bold>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, I’ve been so influenced by being in a cell biology department. Now I’m taken with this question of how you synthesize these very large matrix proteins, get them through the secretory pathway, and ultimately, how you can use that secretory machinery to modulate BM structure during development. I find these really hardcore protein secretion questions so satisfying. Honestly, I love it and I didn’t know that I would!</p>

          <italic>You acknowledge your husband, Nick Badovinac, for illustrations in some of your papers—is he an artist?</italic>
        </bold>
      </p>
      <p>No, but he has artistic tendencies. He has always been my absolute biggest supporter and he likes being involved in the lab. When I wrote a review on egg chamber morphogenesis, he decided he wanted to teach himself how to use computer drawing packages, and he’s been doing illustrations for most of my work ever since. It’s great because a simple illustration can often convey the biology much more clearly and can help orient an audience to look at the real data in tissues, too.</p>
      <p>
        <bold>
          <italic>Do you have a scientific hero?</italic>
        </bold>
      </p>
      <p>My graduate advisor, Didier Stainier, has been and continues to be a wonderful mentor to me. What I really admire about him is that he takes a very rigorous approach to the science that he does <italic>and</italic> he is open to going in new directions.</p>
      <p>The number of topics that his lab has made significant contributions to over the years is almost dizzying. He gives his people an amazing amount of freedom to explore their own creativity and I think that’s really valuable.</p>

        <p id="P1">Ligand-induced protein allostery plays a central role in modulating cellular signaling pathways. Here, using the conserved cyclic-nucleotide binding domain of protein kinase A’s (PKA) regulatory subunit as a prototype signaling unit, we combine long-timescale, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with Markov state models to elucidate the conformational ensembles of PKA’s cyclic-nucleotide binding domain A for the cAMP-free (apo) and cAMP-bound states. We find that both systems exhibit shallow free-energy landscapes that link functional states through multiple transition pathways. This observation suggests conformational selection as the general mechanism of allostery in this canonical signaling domain. Further, we expose the propagation of the allosteric signal through key structural motifs in the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain and explore the role of kinetics in its function. Our approach integrates disparate lines of experimental data into one cohesive framework to understand structure, dynamics, and function in complex biological systems.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P2">Since the introduction of the allosteric effect in <italic>L-threonine deaminase</italic><sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, researchers have sought to understand the mechanisms of allostery. The classical phenomenological models proposed by Monod-Wyman-Changeux<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and (Pauling)-Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> have been extended over time to emphasize population shifts or modulations in the conformational ensemble of the proteins<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Fundamentally, it is the character of the underlying free-energy landscape that determines the mechanism of allostery<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P3">While experimental and computational approaches provide insight into allosteric mechanisms<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, a robust atomic-level description of the free-energy landscape remains a challenge due to a variety of methodological limitations. Without an atomic-level description of the conformational ensemble and its corresponding free-energy landscape, the details of allostery can remain hidden within ensemble averages or constrained perspectives of protein conformation and dynamics.</p>
      <p id="P4">The objective of our work is to apply cutting-edge computational approaches to explore the conformational ensemble of a protein with and without a bound ligand, thereby gaining insight into how the ensemble gives rise to protein function. This work focuses on the mechanism of ligand-driven allostery in the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain of protein kinase A’s (PKA) regulatory subunit. Despite extensive research conducted on this system<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, questions still remain.</p>
      <p id="P5">The intercellular activation of PKA by cAMP is a prototypical example of ligand-protein allostery, which occurs through the cooperative binding of cAMP to tandem cyclic-nucleotide binding domains, designated A and B, in each of PKA’s regulatory subunits<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Crystallographic data shows that the regulatory subunit, isoform Iα, undergoes significant conformational changes upon binding cAMP. It transitions from an extended holo-enzyme conformation that inhibits PKA’s catalytic subunits to a compact cAMP-bound conformation that releases and activates PKA’s catalytic subunits<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Within the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain, the inactive holo-enzyme and the active cAMP-bound conformations of the regulatory subunit are characterized by the conformational changes in three structural motifs: the N3A motif, the phosphate-binding cassette (PBC), and the B/C helix<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, leaving the core β-barrel sub-domain largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These structural motifs represent the fundamental signal transduction component and form the binding interface between the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain and PKA’s catalytic subunit.</p>
      <p id="P6">The existing crystallographic data provides only two conformational states for the cyclic-nucleotide binding domains, the holo-enzyme (a.k.a. H or <italic>inactive</italic>)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and the cAMP-bound conformation (a.k.a. B or <italic>active</italic>)<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. NMR dynamics data of the minimal functional component of PKA’s regulatory subunit, the A cyclic-nucleotide binding domain (aa. 119–244), indicates the presence of two dominant conformational states<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and suggests conformational selection as the mechanism of allostery<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Upon cAMP binding, changes in NMR chemical shift data implicate the phosphate-binding cassette as a major dynamic element, while few changes are observed in the N3A motif or the B/C helix.</p>
      <p id="P7">However, such experiments are limited in their ability to elucidate details of the full structural ensemble. Instead, they provide averaged metrics that correlate to dynamic motions. Achieving an atomistic description of the underlying conformational ensemble and resolving the corresponding free-energy landscape will clarify the mechanisms by which cAMP modulates the function of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain.</p>
      <p id="P8">Because the PKA holo-enzyme contains four cyclic-nucleotide binding domains, cAMP-induced activation is a complicated process. A recent study by Boras et al.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> provided a general blueprint of the events during activation at the subcellular level, but the molecular mechanism of activation remains to be elucidated.</p>
      <p id="P9">To build a foundation on which to address these questions, we simulated fully solvated atomistic models of the conformational ensembles of the A cyclic-nucleotide binding domain (hereafter referred to as the <italic>cyclic-nucleotide binding domain</italic> or <italic>CBD</italic>), with and without cAMP bound. Extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were integrated using Markov state model theory to explore PKA’s conformational space and long-timescale dynamics. Markov state models depict the interaction dynamics of discrete interconnected states as a transition probability matrix, at a fixed lag time, assuming that the transitions between states are independent of previous transitions (i.e., Markovian)<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. By assigning individual frames extracted from MD trajectories to discrete conformational states, sampling from many separate trajectories can be integrated into one coherent framework that captures the kinetics and thermodynamics of the conformational ensemble at atomic resolution.</p>
      <p id="P10">Similar approaches have been used to study protein folding<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, biased transition pathways between functional states<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, identification of cryptic allosteric sites<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, and ligand regulation of G-protein coupled receptors<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Our work is unique in that it directly assesses the atomic conformational landscape using initial unbiased long-timescale MD simulations augmented with adaptive sampling of one protein in two functional states, as opposed to only combining many short-timescale simulations or sampling along a predetermined reaction coordinate.</p>
      <p id="P11">We find that the conformational ensembles of cAMP-free (CBD-Apo) and cAMP-bound (CBD-cAMP) functional states exist within a shallow free-energy landscape that allows access to both experimentally determined functional conformations, indicating conformational selection as the principal mechanism of allostery with the isolated cyclic-nucleotide binding domain. We find that the addition of cAMP modifies the principal motions of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain, which correspond to transitions between active and inactive states. Furthermore, our approach exposes the propagation of the allosteric signal through the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain’s signaling motifs.</p>
      <p id="P12">Our results complement existing structural<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and dynamical<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> experimental data, and extend our understanding of the mechanism of ligand-induced allostery within the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain.

        <title>Modeling the Conformational Landscape</title>
        <p id="P13">To explore and map the conformational landscapes of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain, we integrated multiple molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with Markov state models. Explicit solvent MD simulations of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain were performed with and without cAMP-bound systems (CBD-cAMP and CBD-Apo, respectively).</p>
        <p id="P14">The MD simulations of both systems sampled a totaled 74 µs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The simulations were composed of four long-timescale, ~13 µs simulations on the Anton supercomputer<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> (at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center) and multiple parallel short-timescale, 0.5–1 µs simulations using GPU-accelerated AMBER12<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. For both systems, sampling simulations were initiated from experimentally determined atomic coordinates of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> in both the inactive and active conformations. Initial sampling was followed by multiple rounds of directed sampling (10–15 ns simulations using GPU-accelerated AMBER12<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>) to refine the Markov state models<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Directed sampling simulations were initiated from intermediate conformations selected near poorly sampled transitions within the Markov state model. For both the CBD-cAMP and CBD-Apo systems, no single simulation sampled a complete transition between the experimentally determined inactive and active structures. However, simulations started from either experimental conformation overlapped in conformational space, based on alpha carbon root mean squared distance (RMSD), indicating that the MD trajectories could be integrated meaningfully into a single Markov state model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P15">To build the Markov state models, we needed to define the conformational space, and then divide the space into discrete conformational states. As in protein-folding models<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>, the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain conformations are defined by the atomic coordinates of each residue’s alpha carbon. We divided the sampled conformational space into discrete conformational states through RMSD clustering using MSMBuilder2<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. We pre-aligned structures to a common reference frame to calculate RMSD to capture important translational motions lost using the standard minimum RMSD approach, which aligns each pair of compared structures to each other before determining RMSD. Inspection of the individual MD trajectories indicated that the β-barrel of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain was stable relative to the motions of the N3A motif, the phosphate-binding cassette (PBC), and the B/C helix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, we used the β-barrel as our common reference frame.</p>
        <p id="P16">All conformations sampled from the MD simulations of both the CBD-Apo and CBD-cAMP systems were clustered together to create a comprehensive framework of conformational states. Once the conformation states were identified, Markov state models were built for each system. This means that the models were built using the same division of conformational space, but each model included only states sampled in its respective simulations. (A comparison between this approach and clustering conformations from CBD-Apo and CBD-cAMP separately is discussed below.)</p>
        <p id="P17">The Markov state models were built by specifying the maximum distance or <italic>cut-off</italic> for the clustering algorithm, which determined how the conformational space was divided, and a lag time for the model. Model parameters were selected because they were Markovian, as indicated by implied timescale plots, and could maximize the number of conformational states. Additionally, consistency between the Markov state models and the MD simulations were determined by the Chapman-Kolmogorov test<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> (i.e., were the models’ generated trajectories similar to the results from the original MD simulations?) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 3–10</xref>). An evaluation of several RMSD cut-offs and lag times indicated that the best Markov state model utilized a clustering cut-off of 3.0 Å and a lag time of 9.6 ns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 3–4</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P18">Graphs of the Markov state models for CBD-Apo and CBD-cAMP are visualized as a network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Each node corresponds to a cluster of similar conformations or a single conformational state. The diameters of the nodes are proportional to the log of equilibrium population of the conformational state. Thus, smaller nodes indicate conformations that are more rarely sampled. The location of each node is determined by the RMSD of the structure of the cluster’s generator, approximately the centroid of the cluster, to the inactive and active crystallographic structures. We note that the location of each node gives a general indication of the conformation of each state relative to the experimental structures, but node locations are a projection from a higher-dimensional space. (Separation of the experimentally determined active node, indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, from the bulk of the other nodes is an artifact of the clustering algorithm in MSMBuilder2<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, which selects the first molecular dynamics frame [i.e., the equilibrated starting active conformation] as a generator for the first cluster. Notice that the separation of the active conformation node from its neighbors is approximately 3 Å or the RMSD cut-off of the clustering algorithm.)</p>

        <title>Ligand-meditated Changes in the Conformational Ensemble</title>
        <p id="P19">A comparison of the models of the conformational state ensembles for the CBD-Apo and CBD-cAMP systems allowed us to assess how the binding of cAMP modifies the overall free-energy landscape. We compared the distribution of conformational states between the two systems, the overall character of the free-energy landscape, and the kinetics of traversing the free-energy landscape between functional conformations states. For this comparison, and throughout this work, we assumed that the crystallographic structures represent the functional conformations (active or inactive states) of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain. The nodes containing the functional conformations are indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P20">When comparing the conformational landscapes of CBD-Apo and CBD-cAMP, we noticed two striking features: the large number of shared states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and the character of the unique states. The models indicate that the systems share ~70% of the total number of sampled conformational states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Notably, the shared conformational states of CBD-Apo and CBD-cAMP comprise 66% and 38%, respectively, of the total population for each ensemble.</p>
        <p id="P21">Many of the unique CBD-Apo conformational states contain structures in which the cAMP-binding site is formed poorly and, thus, sterically prevented from occurring when cAMP is bound (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>). Many of the most populated unique CBD-cAMP conformational states exhibit structures in which the C-terminus is interacting with cAMP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>). These states include the dynamical capping of cAMP’s adenosine ring by Y244, part of the C-helix, that substitutes the native capping residue W260 from the “B” CBD in the full regulatory subunit<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. These capping interactions with Y244 have been observed experimentally in the truncated RIα (aa. 1–259)<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> but not previously observed in simulations. Additionally, fluorescent experiments studying the dynamics of R239 (located on the C-helix) indicate that the C-helix has a higher propensity to interact with the core cyclic-nucleotide binding domain in the presence of cAMP<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. The unique CBD-cAMP conformational states are not sterically excluded from the CBD-Apo conformation ensemble, and interactions between the C-terminus and the cAMP-binding sites were observed in the CBD-Apo ensemble. Therefore, the absence of unique states in the CBD-cAMP ensemble is likely due to the absence of stabilizing interactions between cAMP and the C-terminus. Importantly, both models sampled the active and inactive states, yet neither state is the most populated conformational state in either system.</p>
        <p id="P22">Using the most probable conformational state as the reference state, at physiological conditions the depth of free-energy landscape is 6.6 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> for CBD-Apo and 7.6 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> for CBD-cAMP. The free energies for the individual conformational states follow a Gaussian distribution with a mean depth of the free-energy landscape at 3.1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> +/− 1.4 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> for CBD-Apo and 4.2 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> +/− 1.6 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> for CBD-cAMP. The transition free energy out of a conformational state to any of its neighboring conformational states (i.e., only states that it is connected to) ranges from 5.8 to 8.6 kcals mol<sup>−1</sup> for both systems. (5.8 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> corresponds to a transition made at approximately the lag time of the Markov state model and, thus, is the lowest bound transition free energy calculated from the Markov state model.) The absolute difference in free energy between the active and inactive states is 0.1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> for CBD-Apo and 0.9 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> for CBD-cAMP. Overall, the free-energy landscapes of both systems provide access to both functional states at physiological conditions, with cAMP binding deepening the free-energy landscape by ~1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
        <p id="P23">Transition pathway theory<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> identified the 10 highest flux paths between the functional conformational states for each ensemble (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>). The proportion of the highest flux path relative to the total flux for each functional state ensemble was striking: For CBD-Apo, the highest flux path was only 9% of the total flux, and for CBD-cAMP, it was only 4% of the total flux (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The lack of a dominant path and the variety of paths identified in the analysis indicate that there are multiple pathways between functional conformational states. Inspection of the pathways indicated no common order of conformational changes or shared features at the bottlenecks of the pathways.</p>
        <p id="P24">Therefore, to understand the transition between active and inactive conformation states across the free-energy landscape, we needed to look at the transition pathways collectively. We measured the kinetics of the transition between active and inactive states using mean first passage times (i.e., the fastest average time it takes for the system to move across the free-energy landscape from active to inactive state, or <italic>vice versa</italic>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, the mean first passage times for the transition from inactive to active state are similar with or without cAMP bound: ~30 µs. However, the addition of cAMP slows the transition from active to inactive state by a factor of five, from 16 µs to 84 µs.</p>
        <p id="P25">These results indicate that CBD-Apo favors the inactive state, which inhibits PKA’s catalytic subunit, whereas CBD-cAMP favors the state that activates PKA’s catalytic subunit. Thus, the dynamics of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain derived from the Markov state models are consistent with the function of the regulatory subunit in PKA.</p>
        <p id="P26">Taken together, our results indicate conformational selection as the governing mechanism of allostery in the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain. The weakest evidence for this mechanism is the number of shared states between both models because it is largely a function of the clustering algorithm. However, when the conformations for each system are clustered separately, the results are the same. In fact, the joint clustering approach better captures the principal motions of the CBD at a 3.0 Å clustering cut-off, as determined by implied timescale plots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P27">The stronger evidence supporting conformational selection is the change in the free-energy landscape and the corresponding transition kinetics. Weinkam and coworkers<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> classified allosteric mechanisms based on the difference between the change in free energy of two functional states and the binding free energy of the ligand. Although the current Markov state models do not allow determination of the free energy of cAMP binding, and there has been no direct experimental measurements of cAMP binding in our construct, we can estimate the binding free energy of cAMP through previous work on the isolated A cyclic-nucleotide binding domain<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. The free energy of binding of cAMP to the isolated A cyclic-nucleotide binding domain is approximately −3 kcal mol<sup>−1 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. This value is greater than the difference in free energy between the active and inactive states, ~-1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>, supporting conformational selection as the general mechanism of allostery. Additionally, the on-rate for cAMP to the A cyclic-nucleotide binding domain of R, ~4.8x10<sup>4</sup> s<sup>−1 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, is faster than the transition times between active and inactive states in the CBD-cAMP system. And the fact that the transition rates between inactive and active conformations are independent of ligand binding indicate conformational selection as described by Zhou<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Experimental results<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> support conformational selection as the mechanism of ligand-induced allostery, thus complementing the interpretations of our Markov state model presented here.</p>
        <p id="P28">One limitation of our models is the potential bias towards conformational selection because the simulations were initiated at both experimentally determined active and inactive states, which were included in and connected through the Markov state models. However, nothing sterically hinders cAMP from binding either functional conformational state in the absence of the catalytic subunit, and no restraints were required to keep cAMP bound during the simulations. Thus, all four systems used to initiate the simulations are potential members of the conformational ensemble. Starting the simulations in each experimental conformation does not predispose them to becoming members of highly populated or networked states or bias the transition kinetics between active and inactive states.</p>

        <title>Conformational Space, Principal Motions, and Function</title>
        <p id="P29">While our results indicate conformational selection as the general mechanism of allostery for the CBD, this finding is not wholly novel due to previous experimental work<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. However, our work provides a foundation to delve further into the mechanisms of allostery at an atomic scale in ways inaccessible to current experimental methods: We can explore structural characteristics of the equilibrium conformational space, and the principal motions of the CBD and its functional macrostates.</p>
        <p id="P30">To understand the structural characteristics of the conformational landscapes, we built stationary probability density volumes of the positions of the alpha carbons. In other words, we sought to determine the probability of finding the mass of the alpha carbons in a given volume of space at equilibrium. The volumes were determined by dividing the space in 0.1 Å voxels and calculating the probability of finding an alpha carbon within 3 Å (the RMSD cut-off for the Markov state model) of the voxel for each conformational state. By summing over all states, we obtained a map of the stationary probability density, which provides a visual representation of the conformational ensembles.</p>
        <p id="P31"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> shows the probability of density surfaces at 66%, 95%, and 99.9%. The volume enclosed by each surface has a probability greater than the cut-off of being occupied by an alpha carbon. This figure shows the wide range of motion sampled by the α-helical structural subdomain at equilibrium; this range of motion is similar for the CBD-Apo and CBD-cAMP systems. Similar to the graphical representation of the Markov state model, the stationary probability density volumes indicate the similarity of the conformations sampled by CBD-Apo and CBD-cAMP.</p>
        <p id="P32">However, the differences between the stationary probability density volumes give us new structural insight into the mechanisms of allostery within the CBD. The first notable difference is the unique density formed by the B/C helix proximal to cAMP in the CBD-cAMP ensemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). This density corresponds to the interactions between the C-terminus and the adenosine ring of cAMP discussed above. A second difference is the higher probability that the N3A motif extends over the B/C helix in the CBD-Apo ensemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). This density corresponds with the experimentally determined binding interface between PKA’s catalytic and regulatory subunits.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Interestingly, the CBD-Apo system only increased density by about 10% in forming the interface. This small variation shows how seemingly small changes in a conformation ensemble give rise to inhibitory function of the CBD-Apo system by increasing the probability of formation of the binding interface between PKA’s catalytic and regulatory subunits.</p>
        <p id="P33">To determine the principal motions of the CBD, we built kinetic coarse-grained models from the Markov state models of each system to identify metastable states or the principal motions of CBD arising from the conformational ensemble. These models were generated by complementarily employing principal component and Markov clustering analysis<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P34">The CBD-Apo implied timescale plots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>) suggest at least one dominant slow motion followed by numerous secondary faster motions. The dominant slow motion of the CBD-Apo ensemble is between conformations similar to the active and conformations similar to the inactive conformational states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Of note, the second most dominant motion is integration of the unfolded N-helix (the N3A motif) into the core β-barrel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 15</xref>). These conformations are only observed in the CBD-Apo ensemble as they deform the cAMP-binding site, sterically excluding cAMP. Integration of the unfolded N-helix requires partial unfolding of the core β–barrel, which was observed in previous NMR work<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. We recognize that these conformations may be an artifact of the truncated CBD and, therefore, may not be part of the mechanisms of allostery for the regulatory subunit <italic>in vivo</italic>. Still, the consistency between the results of the simulations and the NMR work indicates that the models are able to replicate structural events seen experimentally.</p>
        <p id="P35">Like the CBD-Apo system, the implied timescale plot for the CBD-cAMP system indicates one dominant slow motion followed by a number of faster motions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Although the dominant motion is structurally similar to that of CBD-Apo (i.e., it is also the transition between active and inactive conformations [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>]), it is slower than that of CBD-Apo (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 3 and 4</xref>). Interestingly, the second slowest motion within the CBD-cAMP system corresponds to those states where the C-terminus is interacting with cAMP.</p>
        <p id="P36">To strengthen the relationship between motions of the CBD and its function, we generated a functional coarse-grained model of the conformational ensembles. The model identifies which conformational stats have a higher probability of transitioning to either the active of inactive state, thus indicating the role of each conformational state in the function of the system. Using committer analysis from transition pathway theory<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>, the ensembles were divided into two functional macrostates. Each macrostate was composed of conformational states with a &gt;50% probability of transitioning to the active or inactive state. In other words, the functional coarse-grain model can be conceptualized as the “continental divide” of the free-energy landscape, indicating to which functional state (active or inactive) an individual conformational state is connected to most strongly.</p>
        <p id="P37">The functional coarse-grain model of CBD-Apo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) contains similar populations for the active and inactive macrostates, with a preference for the inactive macrostate. CBD-cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), however, prefers the active macrostate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). These results agree with NMR studies that show similar inactive and active conformational populations at very-low-cAMP concentration and domination of the active macrostate at high-cAMP concentrations<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Additionally, the relationship of the half-life of either functional macrostate is similar to the mean first passage time between functional conformational states in that transitions from inactive to active states have similar kinetics in both systems, whereas the presence of cAMP slows the transition from active to inactive state (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P38">The functional coarse-grain model and the kinetic coarse-grain model closely correlate with each other as determined by conformational state membership in the functional or kinetic macrostates. Correlation between the two coarse-grained models is expected as they both depend on the transition kinetics of the Markov state models; however, which motion corresponded to the change in functional states is not clear <italic>a priori</italic>. This correlation indicates that the functional macrostates determined by transition pathway theory correspond to the slowest motion of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). It also supports the assumption that the crystallographic conformations represent the active and inactive states of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain and that its slowest motion is the transition between active and inactive states.</p>
        <p id="P39">The coarse-grained models combined with observations of the change in stationary probability densities for the two systems support a general explanation that the modification of the transition kinetics by cAMP gives rise to function. In CBD-Apo, transitions between states occur with a tendency towards the inactive conformation, which increases the likelihood of generating the interface that allows for the regulatory subunit to bind the catalytic subunit leading to inactivation of PKA. With cAMP bound, the transition between inactive and active states is slower, which is likely the result of interactions formed between the C-terminus and cAMP. The preference for the active-like conformations in the CBD-cAMP system decreases the probability of forming the binding interface and allowing activation of PKA.</p>

        <title>Motions of the Signaling Motifs</title>
        <p id="P40">To gather more detail on the allosteric mechanism, we examined the propagation of an allosteric signal through the helical signaling motifs of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain by building new Markov state models for the three principal signaling motifs using the same MD trajectories (apo and cAMP-bound). While the motions of the signaling motifs are captured in the Markov state models of the full CBD, as discussed above, individual models elucidate the conformational ensembles of focused structural elements and provide an unobstructed view of their modulation by cAMP. The Markov state models for the individual motifs were developed and analyzed using the same methods for the full system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 5–10</xref>). They indicate conformational selection as the general mechanism of allostery, due to well-connected active and inactive conformational states (Figure 7) with multiple pathways across the free-energy landscape for each of the three key motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P41">When we compared the conformational state distribution between the apo and cAMP-bound systems, we observed that the N3A motif and the B/C helix share a majority of their conformational states (Figure 7 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), similar to the full cyclic-nucleotide binding domain. The B/C helix generally explores the conformational space between the experimentally determined active and inactive structures (Figure 7A). However, the N3A motif explores conformations dissimilar to either experimental conformation (Figure 7C). These models are consistent with the observed motions of these domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), particularly with the unfolding of the N-helix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P42">These results support and help explain why there is no observed change in chemical shifts in NMR experiments<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> for the N3A motif or the B/C helix despite the changes in the crystallographic structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Simply put, in solution the conformational space explored by the N3A motif and the B/C helix is largely independent of cAMP, though cAMP does modulate the relative populations of the conformational states and their kinetics.</p>
        <p id="P43">In contrast, the phosphate-binding cassette showed significant changes in chemical shifts upon binding cAMP.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> While these changes appear to be driven by interaction with cAMP, the Markov state model of the phosphate-binding cassette illuminates another aspect of these changes: that, upon binding of cAMP, the phosphate-binding cassette loses about half of its conformational states, representing a significant loss in conformational entropy (Figure 7B, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Additionally, the kinetic and functional coarse-grain models of the phosphate-binding cassette show significant changes between apo and cAMP systems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 17 and Supplementary Table 5</xref>) unlike the other signaling motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 16, 18 and Supplementary Tables 4, 6</xref>). Without cAMP, the phosphate-binding cassette has a shallow free-energy landscape with quick transition between metastable macrostates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 17, and Supplementary Table 5</xref>). With cAMP bound, there is one dominant (slow) transition between two metastable macrostates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 17, and Supplementary Table 6</xref>; also compare implied timescale plots in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 7 and 8</xref>). Unlike the other models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 16 and 18</xref>), the conformational states that comprise these metastable macrostates do not correspond to the division of microstates seen in the functional coarse-grain model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 17</xref>). Instead the functional coarse-grain model indicates a strong propensity of the phosphate-binding cassette to assume a cAMP-binding conformation or active conformation even in the absence of cAMP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 17 and Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Overall, the model shows that, without cAMP bound, the phosphate-binding cassette explores a variety of conformations, but the binding site has a tendency to assume the active cAMP-bound conformation. cAMP binding selects the active conformation while allowing transition between active and inactive state but significantly slows the transition between these states (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 16</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P44">The spatial arrangement of the helical signaling motifs suggests that the propagation of the allosteric signal would be from the phosphate-binding cassette to the B/C helix to the N3A motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Even the natures of the conformation ensembles, described by the Markov state models, suggest propagation of the allosteric signal from a switch like the phosphate-binding cassette out to the conformationally diverse N3A motif.</p>
        <p id="P45">However, the kinetics of the signaling motifs suggest another mechanism. The mean first passage times between active and inactive states suggest that the movement of the B/C helix is the rate-limiting step for the functional transition because it has the slowest transitions between active and inactive states (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Like the full CBD, the B/C helix has similar transition times between active and inactive states whether or not cAMP is bound. However, cAMP significantly decreases the rate of the active-to-inactive transition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This rate reduction is due to stabilization of the active conformation by cAMP through interactions between the C helix and cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), as observed and discussed above.</p>
        <p id="P46">In PKA and other proteins, the experimental free energy of binding of cAMP to the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain is dominated by enthalpic contributions<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>–<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>, suggesting that the contacts between cAMP and the phosphate-binding cassette and B/H helix are drivers for this phenomenon. Our model indicates that the binding of cAMP near the phosphate-binding cassette dampens the dynamics of that signaling motif, greatly increasing its propensity to adopt an active-like conformation, and that the motions of the B/C helix are the rate-limiting step in this transition.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="P47">Overall, we find that the prototype cyclic-nucleotide binding domain is a highly dynamic system and that cAMP modulates its function by modifying the dynamics of the signaling motifs. By comparing CBD-Apo and CBD-cAMP ensembles, we see that the free-energy landscape allows access to both active and inactive states through an ensemble of transition pathways (i.e., there is no one dominant pathway between states). Collectively, our analysis supports conformational selection as the general mechanism of allostery in this system. The addition of cAMP modulates the transition rates between the functional states but only between active-to-inactive states and not <italic>vice versa</italic>. This modulation of rates occurs by slowing motion in the CBD-cAMP ensemble, which is caused by interactions with cAMP. Finally, our work indicates that the change in dynamics of the B/C helix is the rate-limiting step in adopting a fully active conformation. Furthermore, the motion of the B/C helix is essential for signal propagation to the N3A motif and formation of the interface with the catalytic subunit. This mechanism could be tested experimentally though NMR by observing shifts in the relative populations of active and inactive ensembles caused by mutations in the C-terminus, specifically, mutations of residue 244, which should modify interactions with cAMP.</p>
      <p id="P48">While the general mechanism of allostery for the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain is conformational selection, some elements of the mechanism appear to behave more like induced fit. Particularly notable in this regard are the interactions between the C-helix and cAMP, which generate multiple conformational states that are not sampled in the apo state, as compared to the motions of the individual signaling motifs that appear more similar to entropic mechanisms of allostery. Furthermore, in the context of activation of the full kinase, these mechanisms may change, as interaction with the catalytic subunit and the remaining portions of the regulatory subunit will almost certainly modulate the conformational ensemble of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain. This work suggests that a clearer picture of the free-energy landscape, achieved through an integrated experimental and computational approach, is required to fully understand allosteric behavior.</p>
      <p id="P49">Although a number of our conclusions were already observed experimentally, the power of our computational Markov-state-model-based approach is that it unifies multiple lines of existing experimental data into a single, cohesive framework and, thereby, achieves a more complete understanding of allostery. This approach builds on an emerging paradigm for understanding protein function and dynamics based on computational exploration and visualization of protein conformational ensembles and their underlying functional free-energy landscapes in atomic detail.</p>

Markov state models were built with a clustering cut-off of 4.5 Å for the N3A motif, 1.5 Å for the phosphate-binding cassette, and 4.5 Å for the B/C helix. The lag time used was 9.6 ns.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Genome-wide transcription factor (TF) binding profiles differ dramatically between cell types. However, not much is known about the relationship between cell-type-specific binding patterns and gene expression. A recent study demonstrated how the same TFs can have functional roles when binding to largely non-overlapping genomic regions in hematopoietic progenitor and mast cells. Cell-type specific binding profiles of shared TFs are therefore not merely the consequence of opportunistic and functionally irrelevant binding to accessible chromatin, but instead have the potential to make meaningful contributions to cell-type specific transcriptional programs.</p>

      <p>Transcription factors (TFs) are important regulators of cell-type-specific gene expression, and represent the paradigm for DNA-binding proteins that influence cellular development. Hematopoiesis has long served as a model to study the transcriptional control of cell type specification, and transcriptional regulatory elements for several major regulators of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been studied in detail using both mammalian and lower vertebrate model organisms.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1-14</sup></xref> Nevertheless, much remains to be learned about the cell-type-specific transcriptional mechanisms that govern hematopoietic cell type identity. A thorough investigation into how TFs can contribute to distinct transcriptional programs, therefore, is critical for understanding how cells acquire and maintain their identity. During hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and blood cell development, it is well known that these cells share many TFs across distinct lineages. The PU.1 TF, for example, auto-regulates itself in 2 different cell types (myeloid and B-cells) through co-operative interaction with distinct cell-specific TFs.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Furthermore, the SCL TF is required not only for specifications of HSC but also differentiation along the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15,16</sup></xref> Interestingly, binding sites for the same TF in 2 cell types have been shown to be largely non-overlapping and behave in a cell-type-specific manner.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17,18</sup></xref> These findings, therefore, raise the question as to whether both cell-type-specific and common TF binding patterns in the genome have functional consequences for defining cell fate. Several recent review papers provided in-depth discussions on what may constitute functional TF binding, suggestions to discover functional enhancers or indeed if co-operative TF binding represents a continuum rather than just 2 states.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19-22</sup></xref> These discussions revealed many unresolved questions on the topic including the fundamental need to identify binding activity that results in stable cellular states.</p>
      <p>In a recent study, we examined the nature of binding site preferences and co-occupancy in 2 closely related cell types.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> The cell types compared were primary mast cells and a multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell line, HPC7,<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> which we have established as a useful model for studying early blood stem/progenitor cells.<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25,26</sup></xref> Gene expression profiling by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed many significant differences in the expression profiles of the 2 cell types. Nevertheless, many known TFs display similar expression in both cell types and this includes key regulators of hematopoietic stem cells (i.e., E2A, Erg, Fli1, Gata2, Lmo2, Meis1, PU.1, Runx1, and Scl). Generation of genome-wide TF binding maps by chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) of those ‘shared’ TFs uncovered largely non-overlapping promoter and enhancer occupancy between the 2 cell types. For most of these HSC TFs, it was not known whether (and if so, how) they might have a role in the transcriptional regulation of mast cells.Having established a unique large-scale dataset for comparative analysis, we next asked the question as to what is the role of ‘shared’ TFs in controlling mast cell specific transcriptional programs?</p>
      <p>We examined the observation of distinct binding patterns further by quantifying the differences in binding and their relationship to gene expression in a regression model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). Regression models provide a useful and simple approach to quantify the relationships between multiple predictor variables (i.e., ‘shared’ TFs) to a response variable (i.e., gene expression). Furthermore, the availability of high resolution genome-wide data (i.e., ChIP-seq and RNA-seq) allowed the construction of accurate predictive models. By considering genes bound by at least one of these TFs, these models describe gene expression as a function of combinatorial effects of one or more relative TF binding strengths. In the past, other studies have also utilized regression statistics to build a variety of prediction models that include, for example, TF binding data, histone modification, and consensus binding motifs.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27,28</sup></xref> Until recently, these studies have focused on predicting gene expression in one cell type, obtaining high levels of correlation with observed data. However, applying the model to another cell type often results in poor accuracy since static expression levels were used to construct the model. Our study, on the other hand, employed regression models for 2 cell types to predict changes in gene expression. Thus, when differential promoter and distal enhancer occupancy were encoded into the model, quantitative changes in TF binding were found to be predictive of quantitative changes in differential gene expression. Moreover, prediction accuracy improved when multiple binding events were taken into account.

</p>
      <p>Many regression models described so far assumed that TF binding and gene expression have a linear relationship. Although linearity provides an easy means for performing computations, it is known that this relationship could be non-linear, at least for a subset of TFs. Indeed, gene expression has been shown to be a non-linear function of TF binding as shown in an analysis of K562 and GM112878 cell lines.<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Here, the authors used generalized additive models<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30,31</sup></xref> (GAMs) to identify TFs that influence cell-type-specific gene expression. Similarly, in the HPC7 and mast data set, using GAMs to predict changes in differential gene expression improved prediction accuracy compared to linear regression in 2 ways: (i) allowing non-linearity of TF binding and; (ii) incorporating TF interaction terms to account for co-operative interaction between 2 TFs. Importantly, we could conclude from our modeling that ‘shared’ TFs play an important role in HPC7 and mast cell transcriptional programs, since their differential binding is predictive of expression.</p>
      <p>TF binding depends on interactions with DNA and other TFs at regulatory regions, although it has been suggested that in some occasions it can be largely driven by its cellular environment with no functional consequences. We compared the motif content of common and cell-type-specific regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>) under the hypothesis that the presence of binding motifs for ‘shared’ TF at cell-type-specific bound regulatory regions may provide additional evidence of direct involvement of the ‘shared’ TFs in cell-type-specific programs. We uncovered large numbers of cell-specific and common binding regions that contained consensus sequence motifs for the ‘shared’ TFs. To further analyze the role of ‘shared’ TFs in cell-type-specific genetic programs, we followed 2 approaches: (i) we reduced the levels of some of the ‘shared’ TFs (E2A, Erg, Fli1, Gata2, Lmo2, PU.1) by performing shRNA perturbation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref>) and analyzed the effect on cell-type-specific genetic programs and; (ii) we mutated the putative binding motifs present in cell-type-specific promoters and analyzed the direct effect on gene expression. Our first approach showed that individual knock-down of these regulators significantly affects large numbers of regulated targets with significant changes in cell-type-specific gene expression. Worthy of note, we also found that reduction of the levels of one ‘shared’ factor can affect the recruitment of other ‘shared’ factors. Our second approach demonstrated that ablation of binding motifs for ‘shared’ TFs resulted in strong reduction or even complete abolition of promoter activity.
</p>
      <p>Although binding of ‘shared’ TFs without functional consequences cannot be ruled out for a given specific binding event, our results clearly indicate that the same TF can play an active and determinant role in different cell-type-specific transcriptional programs.</p>

      <title>Conclusions and Future Directions</title>
      <p>Our recent analysis of genome-wide binding sites and gene expression in HPC7 and mast cells has provided new insights into our understanding of lineage-specific transcriptional regulation during differentiation. Furthermore, it reports comprehensive genome-scale data for primary mast cells, where until now very little genome-wide data existed. The use of computational and experimental approaches provided several lines of evidence to show that occupancy of distinct regions in different cell lineages by the same TFs are functionally important and not just a consequence of the cellular environment (<bold>Fig. 2</bold>).</p>
      <p>It is well known that combinatorial TF binding is prevalent in the regulation of metazoan gene expression. However, the specific rules governing these TF interactions and the effects of individual regulatory elements on gene expression remain largely unknown, even though they are recognized to have broad implications for cellular reprogramming. In a study of differentiating embryonic stem cells, for example, the Isl1 protein functions as a component of 2 different regulatory complexes that differ by one TF but lead to either spinal or cranial motor neuron formation.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> TF binding site arrangements, genomic sequence context (e.g., flanking bases, GC content), enhancer composition (heterotypic or homotypic arrangements of TF binding), and DNA tertiary structure are all expected to influence transcriptional activity. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms, therefore, will improve our understanding of how the same TF contributes to distinct cell fates. Research in this area has so far provided little consensus and one example is demonstrated by the ‘enhanceosome’ vs. ‘TF collective’ debate. The classical example of TF complex formation as proposed by the enhanceosome model requires a precise configuration of multiple TFs to function as a unit of regulation. In the well-studied <italic>IFN-</italic>β enhancer, synergistic interaction between all essential TFs is necessary and leads to an ‘all-or-nothing’ response.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> At the opposite end of the spectrum, the ‘TF collective’ model suggests that the effects of TF binding on gene expression are cumulative with varying degrees of potency and redundancy. A recent study comparing TF binding in 2 mouse strains has shown that both ‘shared’ and cell-type-specific TFs are important for establishing the epigenetic and transcriptomic landscapes in mouse macrophages.<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Of note, comparison of naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that differed between the 2 mouse strains revealed strain-specific binding site motifs that correlated with strain-specific gain or loss of TF binding and influenced the recruitment of cell-type-specific factors. The findings in this study also emphasized the presence of binding sites and nucleosome conformation as important features for co-operative TF binding although defined distances between TFs was not crucial. Integrative analyses taking into account dynamic binding, sequence information and 3-dimensional DNA structure to infer general principles of transcriptional regulation would, therefore, help to resolve the disparate findings in this field.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p><italic>Candida albicans</italic> is the most common cause of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis, and this disease is particularly prevalent in immunocompromised patients. The mortality of invasive candidiasis remains 40% to 50% even with the proper treatment with current antifungal drugs. Recently, with the better understanding of host-fungus interactions, notable progress has been made in antifungal vaccine research.

      <p>Invasive candidiasis is the third to fourth most common bloodstream infection in the United States. The mortality of invasive candidiasis is 40% to 50%, even with proper antifungal therapies.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> In China, the incidence (from 4.12% to 41.18%) and mortality (from 9.8% to 60.0%) of opportunistic invasive fungal infections are somewhat different.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Overall <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is the most common <italic>Candida</italic> species causing candidemia, followed by <italic>Candida glabrata</italic>, <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic>, <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic>, and <italic>Candida krusei</italic>. <italic>C. albicans</italic> is fundamentally a human commensal and its interaction with the host immune system plays an important role in both commensalism and infection. Systemic candidiasis occurs predominantly as a consequence of some high-risk medical procedures like central venous catheters, immunosuppressive therapy, surgery, and exposure to broad spectrum antibiotics.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3-9</sup></xref></p>
      <p>In recent years, a number of publications have confirmed the immunogenicity and efficacy of vaccines against candidiasis in animal models,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10-13</sup></xref> and even have tested the efficacy and safety in clinical trials.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14,15</sup></xref> Fungal cell-wall polysaccharide, proteins, and live attenuated fungi have been investigated as vaccine targets.

We also offer possible approaches to strengthen vaccines’ triggering of the host immune response.</p>

      <p>Saville et al.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16,17</sup></xref> selected a genetically engineered <italic>C. albicans tet-NRG1</italic> strain as an attenuated vaccine against disseminated candidiasis.

Without the antibiotic, the high level of <italic>NRG1</italic> blocks the yeast-to-hyphal transition, while DOX treatment inhibits the expression of <italic>NRG1</italic> to allow hyphal formation. In the model, the <italic>C. albicans tet-NRG1</italic> strain was grown overnight without DOX, then 1.7 × 10<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> cells in 200 μl saline were injected into female mice via the lateral tail vein. Two weeks later, all mice received 5.2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells of a fully virulent <italic>C. albicans CAF-2</italic> strain. The survival fraction was monitored during the following 16 d The mice immunized with the <italic>tet-NRG1</italic> strain were 100% viable compared to 100% mortality in the saline group. Furthermore, B-cell-deficient, T-cell-deficient, and neutropenic (DBA/2N) mice were used to evaluate the efficiency of the <italic>tet-NRG1</italic> strain with the same vaccination approach. Both the B-cell-deficient and DBA/2N mice showed 100% survival versus 100% mortality in the control mice, while the vaccine failed to exert protection in the T-cell-deficient mice. According to these experiments, the protection of the attenuated <italic>tet-NRG1</italic> strain relied on a T-cell-mediated adaptive immune response.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> In our laboratory, an attenuated <italic>C. albicans</italic> strain (CaLY55) has shown an exciting protective effect against disseminated candidiasis in mice (unpublished data).

      <title>Protein Vaccines</title>
      <p>Live attenuated <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains have complex antigens that have not been well characterized, leading to restrictions in their application as vaccines. Thoroughly studied protein vaccine candidates such as Sap2p and Als3p are simple and have clearly defined amino acid sequences.

        <title>Sap2p</title>
        <p>The secreted aspartyl proteinase (SAP) family has at least 10 different members, designated Sap1p to Sap10p.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20,21</sup></xref> Naglik et al.<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> analyzed gene expression in over 130 subjects with oral and vaginal <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections and found that <italic>SAP2</italic> and <italic>SAP5</italic> were the most common genes expressed. Other research<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> reached a similar conclusion - that <italic>SAP2</italic>, <italic>SAP4</italic>–<italic>6</italic> and <italic>SAP7</italic> were the predominant proteinases expressed in patients both with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). In the candidal vaginitis model,<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> rats were immunized with 100 μg SAP, in which Sap2p is the majority protein, via intravaginal (i.vag.) or intranasal (i.n.) routes, with or without cholera toxin (CT). SAP vaccination resulted in significant fungal clearance in vagina, and 3 weeks after the infection no fungus was detected in the vaccination group compared to the control. Both administration routes for SAP vaccination resulted in the similar protection, and induced protective IgA antibodies when added with CT.</p>
        <p>Recently, research reported by Bernardis et al.<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> demonstrated a protective Sap2 protein vaccine, PEV7. PEV7 is a truncated, recombinant <italic>C. albicans</italic> Sap2p consisting of amino acids 77 to 400 incorporated into the lipid bilayer of the influenza virosomes, and is designed to protect against RVVC. In the preclinical studies, IgG specific for Sap2p, was significantly induced in NMRI mice immunized with PEV7 via intramuscular (i.m.) injection compared to the control mice. In a rat model of candidal vaginitis, PEV7 generated adequate and persistent protection against <italic>C. albicans</italic> after i.m. immunization whereas i.vag. resulted in a lower response. Furthermore, the PEV7-immunized rats had prolonged survival times and accelerated clearance of fungi. Most of all, PEV7 was also found to be safe in a repeated-dose toxicological study in rats. According to Edwards's review article,<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> a Sap2p vaccine is one of the more promising candidates and has gone through Phase I clinical trials against <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection.

        <p>Agglutinin-like sequence (Als) proteins locate to the surface of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and play important roles in the pathogen's adhesion to human endothelial cells and in the development of invasive candidiasis.<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26-29</sup></xref> Edwards and his co-workers have explored several vaccines against invasive candidiasis, including rAls1p-N (recombinant N-terminus of Als1p),<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10,11,30</sup></xref> rAls3p-N (recombinant N-terminus of Als3p),<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31,32</sup></xref> and NDV-3 (recombinant N-terminus of Als3p formulated with alum adjuvant).<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13,15</sup></xref></p>
        <p>rAls1p-N (amino acids 17 to 432 of Als1p) was produced in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> by recombinant technology and purified by gel filtration and Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix affinity purification. Mice were immunized with rAls1p-N and complete Freund's adjuvant subcutaneously (s.c.) at day 0, then boosted with different dosage of rAls1p-N with incomplete Freund's adjuvant at day 21. Two weeks after the boost, vaccinated mice and the control mice were infected with a lethal inoculum of <italic>C. albicans</italic>.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In the following 30 days, rAls1p-N vaccination improved the survival rate to 50%–57% compared to 100% lethality in the controls, and decreased significantly the fungal burden in the kidney. Meanwhile, mice immunized with the same dosage of rAls1p-N intraperitoneally (i.p.) resulted in 25% survival.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> These experiments remind us that vaccines should have a proper administration method. In particular, rAls1p-N vaccination still had significant protective effects in neutropenic mice, B-cell-deficient mice, and in murine models of oropharyngeal candidiasis and <italic>Candida</italic> vaginitis. According to these experiments, the protective mechanism of rAls1p-N vaccination relied on T cells rather than B cells.</p>
        <p>Als3p is involved in adherence, biofilm formation, and cell invasion.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33,34</sup></xref> rAls3p-N (amino acids 17 to 432 of Als3p) vaccination induced a stronger antibody response than rAls1p-N and provided a similar cell-mediated protection efficacy when combating oropharyngeal or vaginal candidiasis.<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Mice were immunized with rAls3p-N in the same way as rAls1p-N. In the murine oropharyngeal candidiasis model, rAls3p-N vaccination significantly reduced the tongue fungal burden and inflammatory response. Similarly, in a model of <italic>Candidia</italic> vaginitis, rAls3p-N vaccination generated a remarkable reduction in vaginal fungal burden. In the mouse model of disseminated candidiasis, rAls3p-N vaccination notably improved the survival time. However, since the rAls3p-N-vaccinated mice that did not survive had high antibody titers, the antibody titers did not significantly correlate with a protection effect. Compared with rAls1p-N, rAls3p-N vaccination was more effective in treating oropharyngeal candidiasis.</p>
        <p>To further clarify the protective mechanism of rAls3p-N, the authors conducted a series of experiments to explore the mechanism of rAls3p-N vaccine plus aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>) adjuvant in a mouse candidiasis model.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> IFN-γ-deficient mice immunized with CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes from the rAls3p-N-vaccinated wild type donor mice had approximately 40% survival, indicating that CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte-derived IFN-γ was important in combatting <italic>C. albicans</italic>. In cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenic or gp<sup>91phox-/-</sup> deficient mice (unable to generate superoxide and have impaired function in killing microbes), no protection was created by rAls3p-N vaccination, suggesting that neutrophils play an essential role in the protection. Moreover, in IL-17A-deficient mice, there was no vaccine-induced protection either when compared to the control mice. Then the vaccinated IL-17A-deficient mice and the vaccinated wild-type mice were cross-adoptively transferred CD4+ cells. As expected, the transfer of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells from the wild type mice conferred higher protection than transfers from the IL-17A-deficient mice. According to these experiments, IL-17A derived from CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes was necessary for protection. In addition, the protective mechanism also involved many cytokines; for example, the neutrophil activating chemokines KC and MIP-1a. In the rAls3p-N vaccinated mice, higher levels of Th1, Th17 and Th1/17 cells were detected than in the control mice.</p>
        <p>Taken together, the rAls3p-N vaccine improved protection against <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection in mice by inducing Th1, Th17, and Th1/17 lymphocytes, thereby produced cytokines and the recruitment of neutrophils to the infection sites. IL-17A was not necessary for defense against <italic>C. albicans</italic> challenge in non-vaccine immune defense, but was necessary in vaccine-induced protection.</p>
        <p>rAls3p-N formulated with alum adjuvant (NDV-3) has been tested in a Phase I clinical trial, and has shown to be well tolerated even at 300 mg.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> The majority of the subjects had a robust humoral immune response, and elicited high titres of antibody within 3–7 d of administration. As well, the production of IFN-γ and IL-17A was increased. These observations suggest that in humans, NDV-3 stimulated T cells, B cells and antibody responses.</p>

        <p>Fungal cell walls are indispensable organelles and are composed of molecules that are largely absent in mammals. The cell wall plays an important role in continuing cell wall biosynthesis, in growth, in budding in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and especially in crucial host-fungus interactions that facilitate the establishment of human mycoses. Most virulence factors, including those involved in adhesion, invasion, and the yeast-to-hypha transition, localize at the cell wall, and include proteins such as Hsp90p, Sap2p, Als1p and Als3p.

        <p>Since recombinant proteins have been generally produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the expressed proteins aren't glycosylated as they would be in eukaryotic cells, with the result that they differ from the natural structure. Although non-glycosylated proteins are able to mediate protective immunity, glycoconjugates (mannans and β-glucans) have been tested to establish whether it is necessary to be glycosylated to enhance immune response. Specht et al.<xref rid="cit0055" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref> have established the role of mannosylation in inducing protection with protein vaccines against <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> by comparing the protective efficacy of the mannosylated and unmannosylated recombinant proteins produced separately by <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>. Both recombinant proteins generate immune protection against <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> infection. However, the mannosylated protein has the additional ability to induce a potent T cell-mediated immune response, and to protect against infection. Moreover, yeast-mannosylated ovalbumin induced greater T cell proliferation than unmannosylated ovalbumin produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>; this effect was attributed to O-mannosylation rather than N-mannosylation. Mannosylation enhanced both CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation, and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-12.

Cassone<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> has proposed a constructive idea to combine 2 unrelated, major virulence-associated immunogens as a multivalent vaccine. The recombinant antigens Als3p and Sap2p, which are currently in clinical trials, would be the first combination to explore. Although there are several technical and financial difficulties, production of multivalent vaccines is still a promising way to overcome <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection.</p>

        <title>Passive immunotherapy</title>
        <p>A significant challenge to the development of effective vaccines will be to elicit immune responses in immunocompromised individuals who are most at risk for invasive fungal infections. In these vulnerable patients，the vaccine usually elicits a weak immune response or nothing, or even generates side effects. In this circumstance, passive immunotherapy could be considered, which would involve opsonisation, complement fixation, immune response and protective antibodies.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> At present, monoclonal antibody C7 (MAb C7)<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43,57,58</sup></xref> and Mycograb<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> are both successful cases. mAb C7 was produced by standard methods with splenocytes from BALB/c mice immunized with intraperitoneal injections of a <italic>C. albicans</italic> high-molecular-weight stress mannoprotein recognized by salivary secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA). MAb C7 exhibited a potent antifungal effect through inhibiting both germination and the adhesion of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to Hep-2 monolayers and BECs, and through direct candidacidal activity. Further studies claim that mAb C7 binds to the N terminus of Als3p and functions through the blockage of the reductive iron uptake pathway in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Mycograb, as mentioned in section 3.3, binds to <italic>C. albicans</italic> Hsp90p and shows synergistic fungicidal effect with AMB in patients with invasive candidiasis. Antibodies will offer good prospects in immunotherapy especially in immunocompromised individuals. Full assessment of the efficacy in prevention, treatment, prognosis and recurrence would be helpful to determine the best drug administration period.</p>

      <title>Problems and Proposals</title>
      <p>Many positive results have been achieved in the current development of vaccines. Nevertheless, there are still several problems for us to solve - the following are the crucial points: (1) The vaccines show marked protection in animal models, but could be less effective in human; (2) The protection of the vaccine is not persistent or high-grade; (3) The vaccine could cause unacceptable toxicity, which brings new troubles in treatment; (4) There is no prefect standardized manufacturing process; (5) The clinical trials need many volunteers, involve high costs and have a long cycle; (6) Vaccines have a common disadvantage with biologics, it is difficult to maintain stability during the production, transportation, and storage processes.</p>
      <p>Further understanding of the mechanisms of the <italic>C. albicans</italic>-host interaction and identification of some new targets would be of considerable importance. Then, in the preclinical trials, researchers need to consider:<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> (1) Using different species of animals, including mice, rabbits and monkeys, to test the effectiveness of vaccines; (2) Because hosts have different physical status, we should simulate many animal models to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines. These infection models could include immune-normal animals, immune-deficient animals, and could involve variations in the symbiotic bacteria in cross-infection animals; (3) To ensure the susceptibility of <italic>C. albicans</italic> before experiment; (4) The dose of <italic>C. albicans</italic> should be controlled at the required smallest inocula to infect the majority of animals and produce the intended outcome of death or tissue infection; (5) Observe the dosage and delivery time of the vaccines to produce the greatest protection effect; (6) Distinguish various routes of <italic>Candida</italic> infection; (7) Test multiple parameters, such as tissue CFU and survival rates.</p>
      <p>When the vaccines come to clinical trials, researchers should determine the appropriate dosing regimen in real-time tracking feedback according to the tolerance, pharmacokinetics, therapeutic effect and safety. Meanwhile, both the efficacy of the vaccine alone and the synergy of the other antifungal drugs should also be examined.</p>
      <p>In summary, the traditional antifungal chemotherapy against systemic <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections has met some limitations, such as the toxicity and emergence of resistance to the limited options of antifungal drugs. Vaccines can represent novel approaches against <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection. Although the currently available vaccines have demonstrated good protection, there still exist problems such as how to elicit immune responses in immunocompromised individuals. Thus there is still long way to go to finally achieve a vaccine applied in patients.</p>
